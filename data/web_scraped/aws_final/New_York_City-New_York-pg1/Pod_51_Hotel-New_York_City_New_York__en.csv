Having read the tripadvisor reviews prior to booking, I decided on this hotel. We got the airlink and subway from the airport even though late at night, the subway stop is literally 5 mins walk from the hotel, which was a lot cheaper than a taxi. Room was clean, small but adequate for city break as didn’t spend much time in the room or hotel. Only comment would be that the shower is a glass door into the bedroom, which wasn’t any issue for us, but may be a problem for anyone staying with a friend or family member who isn’t their partner. Hotel has a small cafe downstairs which we didn’t try, so can’t comment. Upstairs has a small sun deck and chairs with a good view, probably nice in the summer! Hotel reception were efficient checking us in and out and looked after our bags in the storage room due to us having an evening flight. Ideal location, 10 walk to rockafella and 15-20 mins to Times Square! Would definitely stay at this hotel again if choosing a budget friendly city stay. ","Northallerton, United Kingdom",34,5.0

Check-in was quick and simple, can't remember the name of the guy but he was very friendly and was eager to help. Note that you don't get much documentation about the hotel in your room (if a small menu for the cafe downstairs was in the rooms I would have went a lot sooner)of what is nearby but if you ask at reception they had pages of nearby bars/restaurants that they gave.If you go accepting the fact you aren't getting a huge room and accept it is a budget hotel, you'll love it. Cosy rooms albeit a bit more sound protection from the hallway would have been preferred (I fear my loud snoring may have went through to every room ).I opted for a full pod which included a bathroom inside, tight squeeze but worth it I feel. Rooms included a safe, comfortable bed and a TV. Make sure you do one of the walking tours offered by the hotel.When you're visiting NY you'll not be spending much time in your room but Pod 51 was a perfect location to be able to get out in the morning, pop back for a recharge if needed and head out again.

I opted for a room where you share a bathroom with people on your floor. They were pretty small and didn't have much space for me to set my things but long as they were cleaned regularly, they were fine. The rooms however were tiny. My friend and I stayed in a bunk bed and we could barely stand next to each other. IT WAS TINY. The walls are also very thin. Also, you better hope you're not neighbors with any couples because I heard the action as if i was right there with them LOL.I think its a decent place to stay if you book a room with a private bathroom.

Overall, it is definitely a hybrid of a hostel and micro hotel. Did not get to check out the roof, but it is February. It was considerably cleaner than I expected, but the hallways were quite dim. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Will hold your bags on checkout day if you have plans beyond checkout time. I stayed in a queen room with private bath; the shower was about 30""x30"". On morning #1, I had hot water in the shower within a minute; on morning #2, it was an 8-9 minute wait for hot water (I ate a cup of yogurt and a banana and still had time to kill). Bath and hand towels were provided, but no washcloths. When I inquired about this on checkout, they told me that they had a limited quantity, and washcloths were available upon request, I found this to be quite odd. Other reviewers mentioned difficulty with rooms being either quite warm or quite chilly. When I returned from dinner on night #1, the room was 76 degrees; I switched from heat to AC, set it at 72 degrees and the room stayed around 70 all night. I turned the heat back on for about an hour on evening #2, and then went back to AC, and the temperature was fine, overall. Other reviewers also commented on the noise from outside of the hotel. I didn't have a problem with this at all. The walls are not at all soundproofed, however, and I could easily hear the shower running on the other side of the wall, and people talking in the room on the other side of me. Overall, it was convenient, clean, and met my needs for a very reasonable price close to midtown. Close to subway stops and lots of good restaurants. Will definitely stay here, or at another Pod, again when in Manhattan.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania",4,4.0

Plus I prefer to have a LOT more control over where the jet of water goes in the shower (i.e. below head height!) - I'm not a fan of the waterfall from above mode - which does not suit everybody.They could also do with vending machines for bottles of water in the lobby area and on each floor as the air conditioning makes the rooms really dry - and the cafe is not open for water if you check in late.They have a standard rate for taxis to La Guardia and my early morning taxi arranged by the concierge was on time.With a few adjustments this could be a great hotelNice park with a BIG waterfall (I kid you not) just across the street - to the left of the synagogue.,"London, United Kingdom",23,3.0

The room layout was as expected--a small room but everything needed was there and this had the full bath. The bed was reasonably comfortable and it would have been fine for my travel needs for this trip. What I did not expect was the noise level in the room from the outside. The room was on the second floor and had a cheap in-window AC unit with an accordion-like space filler on each side of the unit. That meant there was only a thin piece of plastic separating the room from the street. As a result, I heard EVERYTHING from the street--even peoples conversations at the front of the hotel. The purgatory started with a very loud dripping noise on the metal AC cover from water generated by the AC in the room a floor above at 4 AM, I mean loud! I am a sound sleeper but this woke me up. Since the window was sealed around the AC, I could not open it to put something on top of the AC to stop the loud dripping. The water torture lasted for about 30 minutes and was enhanced at 420 AM by garbage trucks with whining hydraulics. The final auditory volley was delivered about 630 AM from some ungodly generator noise outside along with the delivery trucks.The other thing that bugged me a bit was that the floor was covered by an indoor-outdoor carpet that had no padding underneath, making the floor pretty hard, and the carpet did not seem that clean to me.

We only realised this after turning the air-con off on the first night and assumed it might be a generator outside our window or something, so requested to move rooms and they did oblige. The new room was on the outside of the building rather than the inside which they said was quieter, and while it was a bit quieter I could still hear the noise even with foam earplugs in. I will stress that the aircon was definitely turned off. Luckily we were exhausted each night and slept ok but for light sleepers this would make this accommodation hellish. The room we were first in was also significantly more dingy than the one on the outside, with a cigerette covered roof outside the window and little natural light. My friend commented that it reminded her of a prison cell. Another issue was the customer service. Consistently, the blonde woman at the concierge desk was chatting to another blonde staff member and ignoring us even when we went to the desk to pick up brochures. The other woman staff member even gave my friend a nasty look when we approached and, despite my making eye contact with her, didn't acknowledge us in any other way. When we checked in, the man behind the desk said something that implied the room he was giving to us was a rubbish room which should have been our first warning sign for the above. Not a great way to make people feel good about their stay. The staff at the luggage store were significantly more friendly. The bathrooms were okay but the water was boiling even on cool and there was nowhere to put your stuff to keep it try, no stool or surface, just one hook which was only enough for your towels, and they didn't seem to get cleaned often as when things like cups or towels were left in there they stayed there for a long time. The elevators took a long time as 1 of 3 is constantly used as a service elevator.The good: The location of the stay was fantastic, we could walk out to a lot of the landmarks we wanted to see and nip back to have a rest, recharge phone / camera batteries or get changed throughout the day. The price was very reasonable for the location, and the luggage store was very useful. The rooms are pretty small, but we expected this from this type of accommodation and they were clean which is the main thing. The star appeal of this location has to be the rooftop terrace, which has phenomenal views and is a suntrap throughout the day. It was never rowdy or crowded out there, every time we went out whether it was to have a morning coffee or an evening drink (BYOB/food, there's no bar or anything) we always got a seat and there was always a nice vibe.Overall: If you want to the location and rooftop views for a low price, then it might be worth your stay and trying to ensure you get a good room on check-in. Rooms with private bathrooms might be better, but you will have to know your room-mate very well as the in-room toilet / shower isn't very private! If you're a light sleeper or intend to spend a fair amount of time in the room, don't bother, find somewhere else.","Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom",17,2.0

The higher you turned up the unit, the louder it was and it did become extremely loud on the highest setting (which was the only setting that cooled the room).At 7.40am in the morning there was a truck directly outside the hotel pumping water or something of that nature and the noise was unbearable. I understand that there would be noise, being in New York and all, but this was terribly loud and woke us up. Some sort of warning from the hotel would have been appreciated.The toilet was very small and low to the ground, so I would not recommend for those who struggle with back issues etc. The basin was also outside of the bathroom and had a very public toilet look to it (it was stainless steel) and just gave the room more of a budget feel.On a positive note, there were plenty of towels provided, a hairdryer and a small desk and chair.

Easy Airtrain/Subway ride to Lexington and 53rd and a less than 5 minute walk around the corner. Our room (218) was a 'full pod' with built in toilet and shower and as expected based on reviews was small - but with no complaints from us. Having our own bathroom was handy, but with one warning - the toilet door is frosted, but one is very well silhouetted when using it, and the shower curtain needs to be pulled across for a little privacy otherwise having eye contact with your partner whilst going about your business might be a little weird. Some might be OK with this, but personally I'm not into that. Likewise, the shower has a see-through panel which cannot be covered so again, unless very comfortable in providing a show for any other occupant of the room, probably best that one goes around to 2nd Avenue for take-out coffee whilst the other completes the morning routines...unless you have a burning desire to get to know each other MUCH better than you already might!This did not detract however from opinions of the hotel, neither did the rather noisy aircon in the room, which made quite a noise as whether set to cool or completely turned off there was a constant loud hum but seeing as one only really uses the room to sleep it was not too bothersome and being tired after exploring Manhattan it certainly did not prevent sleepLocation-wise, it was perfect for our needs.

Any last minute additions or changes will cost as much as another other local budget hotel. (I had to add an extra night on both ends of my stay and it set me back over 340 bucks) 2) Understand that this place is NOT a ritzy hotel. The best I can describe it is a very high end hostel. I chose to stay here for 8 days while my wife was a patient at Sloan cancer center. I was attracted by the price but worried about some of the reviews. I can tell you that all of the negative reviews here are by people who expect FAR too much from a budget hotel. Pros; Room was super clean. Bed was comfortable, view from the 12th floor corner room was nice. I honestly felt 'at home' in my small room. It was like spending the night at your friends house in their small guest bedroom. Cons: I really cant list any deficiencies with the staff, facilities or property. The hotel does have peculiar perfumed smell too it. I didnt dwell too long on the odors it was covering up. Face it, everything in New York city stinks. With that being said.......Ive spent almost 20 years in the Army and Im used to shared bathrooms and small living spaces. These rooms are small and functional. They aren't claustrophobic, but they arent any bigger than the smallest room in your house or apartment. Secondly......the shared bathrooms.....quite a shock if you weren't expecting it. The bathrooms were always clean and well stocked, but some of you may freak out when you walk into a tiny bathroom/shower thats still all wet and steamy from the previous user. I never had to wait for a bathroom, which amazed me. Overall, this is a great budget hotel to stay in as long as you understand what you are booking. Make your reservations at least 7 days in advance and you will get the best rates in NYC. The rooms are clean and comfortable but very sparse. Shared bathrooms can be intimidating for those who arent expecting it.","Ovid, New York",19,4.0

The Pod was cute and well designed, clean and modern. We had a shared bath but there were 4 bathrooms on the floor and a light in the room went on if the bathroom was occupied so you could see when the facility was vacant. The cleaners work hard and do a good job. There is a reasobale cafe in the lobby where you can grab a coffee and a bagel for about $6. We mostly had breakfast over the road at Carol's Cafe in Greenacre Park. I loved the rooftop deck where you could chill out in the sunshine. The hotel do a shuttle service to the airport for $22. If you are travelling with a party of 2 or more then I would say that it is better to get the flat rate yellow taxi service. There is a subway 51st just 2 blocks away and a Duane Reade (like a Tesco Express) just down the road which was handy for snacks etc... I like seeing shows and the walk to Broadway was fine.

The room was very pleasant with a comfortable bed and excellent shower. It was probably one of the smallest rooms I have ever stayed in but location makes up for this. The subway is right beside the hotel with a minutes walk. Times Square is no more than a 15 minute stroll and from there you can also walk to Central Park. All other attractions were easily reached by the subway. There were renovations going on when we were there and so breakfast was limited to coffee and a croissant but there are plenty of others places near the hotel for breakfast.

Because really, are you in NYC to stay in a room or see the sights? A friend recommended another hotel in the Time Square area, but I wanted to be on the East side.

Walking distance to so much (a Starbucks around the corner as well as the famous Ess-a-bagel around the other corner. My room was anything from small actually. Shaped like an ""L"" AND it had a private balcony!!! I would definitely recommend calling the hotel to make the final booking- there are rooms available only by calling. My one concern for others is the bathroom situation. The bathroom is literally right there in the room, so if you're traveling with people you are shy around, you may want to look at the rooms that offer access to the shared bathrooms. I used one and they were uber clean and very private. I will definitely be back AND requesting the same room. ","Savannah, Georgia",21,5.0

It’s very clean and comfortable the hotel and rooms (rooms as you might have guessed are a little on the small side-but as everyone says your not really in your room much as your out exploring the amazing NYC). My wife and I found the room totally fine, we only had carry on backpacks with us,no luggage taking up room space). We think the rooms are cool in the way they have laid them out and used every bit of space possible. Rooms are super clean, and warm (stayed in December).we had a queen bed and our own private bathroom, although every single time we walked through the corridors to go to lift we noticed all the shared bathrooms where always available (we poked our heads in to one,to have a quick look while it was vacant and they where spotlessly clean, very spacious and very safe-it’s one toilet and one shower In the one bathroom, so you won’t actually be in there with anyone else, you use your key to open the bathroom door and lock it once in there. Very private! We said we will save a lil money next time and pay for a room with shared bathroom). Found the hotel to be of a complete mixed age range. Young, middle aged, older (70s,80s+), singles, couples, friends, groups. Great vibe!! My only set back from giving it 5 stars is the doors slamming through the night. When people enter or leave their room the doors do make a loud metal bang, I really hope they invest in fixing this as it would easily be a 5 if we didn’t get woke up a few times in the middle of the night in our comfy bed to loud slamming from doors). The best parts - location! Great central spot,5 min walk to Rockefeller center , st Patrick’s, grand terminal etc etc, but it’s quiet away from all the hustle and bustle of Times Square (you’ll appreciate the 5-10min walk at the end of the day to go back and chill from walking all day). One of our highlights of our NYC trip was getting up real early (5.30am) and walking around the corner to ess-a-bagel to grab an amazing filled bagel for breakfast with a cup of coffee.the most tastey filled bagel there is.it was still dark at that time, you get a really cool feel to NYC at that time,it’s more quieter (still bustling tho lol), you’ll see locals heading off early to work,see deliveries coming and going,and after your bagel go for a nice fresh,early morning walk with your coffee around the blocks and take it all in, brilliant). As we went first thing to ess a bagel there where only maybe 10 people in the que, as we walked past later in the afternoon there where ques out the door and down the street, what a total hotspot, for obvious reasons, so if staying at pod51 go grab breakfast early there).. last but no least, is the amazing roof terrace (again go early as no one will be up there). Go up to the top floor on lift and follow the signs up the stairs leading you out to the roof terrace. What amazing views, unreal. We had the place to ourselves (around 9am) for lots of cool photos and to really take in that we where in NYC. We will 100% stay again, looking forward to returning,just hope the door slamming noises gets sorted :) :) 5 stars for location, price, cleanliness, safeness and comfort.","Greater Sydney, Australia",10,4.0

If you're expecting anything other than very small then this is not the hotel for you. We had a bunk room and the other people we were with had a queen room. The bunk beds aren't very well suited for tall people, I don't think they're the extra long twin size. We found the mattresses to be comfortable. The shared bathrooms in the hallways make the hallways a little louder than other hotels and there was a gap between the door to our room and the floor, which let in noise. The queen room has just enough space to walk around the bed. The bathroom in the queen room was odd: the sliding door into it was opaque, so not much privacy, and then it also had a window into it, so you could totally look in while someone was sitting on the toilet. I appreciated that there was a small cafe in the lobby to get coffee, light breakfast, wine, etc. I was prepared to have a shared bathroom since we were in a bunk bed room; however, it didn't occur to me that sharing a bathroom might increase the odds of seeing someone partially nude in the hallways--which is what happened. A man was walking to the bathroom in the hallway with nothing on his bottom half. I likely wouldn't stay here again for that reason, it made me feel unsafe.

It's close to the 51st st subway station if you take the 6 train to things, but mainly I just walked. I had a shared bathroom floor and my friend and I had a small room with a bunk bed. It's small but really, for the space they thought of everything. There's individual tv's for each person, cutouts in the wall so each person has plugs and USB power. There's a small airplane-like sink in the room with towel beneath. There's a light above the door that tells you when the bathrooms / showers are occupied. We never ran into issues with people fighting for the showers. There isn't much space on the hook to hang stuff though, so definitely bring flip flips and consider a bathrobe / sweatpants. The shampoo / conditioner / body wash they have in the showers is decent. The other thing is that it's not very well insulated, so you can hear a bunch of hallway noise as people come in or out.

We were on a budget during our trip and chose Pod 51 for it's location and reasonable price. First we booked a double room with private bath but I was worried the room would be too small so we upgraded to a Queen Room with private bath and I am glad we did! The room was small but had everything we needed and rooms for our 2 huge suitcases and carry on bags! Every inch of space in the room is used effectively whether it is built in shelving with plugs by the bed or the top shelves above the closet. The nice thing about our room was that it had an amazing balcony (we were on the 11th floor) so the view was great and having coffee on our balcony each morning was perfect. The rooftop deck is really nice too as well as the cafe for coffee and pastries in the morning. The staff were polite and helpful (especially the concierge!) and the room was cleaned well each day. Highly recommend the attached restaurant, Clinton Hall, as well - great food and atmosphere! Finally, the location! Pod 51 is in a great section of Midtown and in perfect walking distance to So many places. It is also just like 2 blocks away from the subway so getting to other parts of NY was super easy! There weren't many things I didn't like about our stay here however, there were some areas for improvement but these didn't dampen our stay. (1) At check-in we weren't given any info about the hotel at all (e.g. cafe hours, concierge hours, wifi info, floor to access the deck, etc.) - some general info would have been helpful and we wouldn't have had to call the front desk so many times; (2) There is no vending machine for bottled water, soda, snacks, etc. If you want bottled water or snacks for your room there is a Duane Reade Pharmacy and CVS pharmacy just 2 blocks away; (3) Elevators were very slow. There are 3 but one is a service elevator and it seems one was always being used by the hotel staff or something as it would stay on one floor paused so that left one lift for the 14 floor building which made for long waits in mornings.Overall, value for the money especially the week after Thanksgiving in Midtown!

We were woken on two separate nights by people returning back to the hotel later than us (and we got in late!) by extensive talking in the corridor at normal voice volume levels and also by the doors of other rooms closing.

Similarly the toilet did not give enough leg room so my feet had to be in the shower to use it when sitting.3. 2 out of the three electric sockets in the room did not work which meant taking turns to charge electric devices/hairdryer etc. which was easy enough to get around but did make it a little bit more difficult.","Solihull, United Kingdom",1,4.0

There was paint chipped, marks on the wall, the toilet paper holder was coming off the wall. I was put on a low floor (always a bad in NYC bc of street noise but that, in and of itself, can't really be helped). What made it particularly bad was that the a/c window unit was still in the window, but it was too cold to have it on....so, I got to hear all of the street noise just like I was sleeping outside. Drunk people yelling right outside my open window at 4a. To make it worse, the front desk called my room at 4:30am to say I had a package. I don't care when the package is delivered - unless a guest tells you to call them when it arrives, you don't call up. You slip a note under the door. Not that it was my package anyway. I don't mind minimalist surroundings. I've done airbnb's and hotels of a wide variety across the US and Europe. But minimalist and inexpensive doesn't have to mean cheap (which everything in the room was, in fact, very cheap). To make it worse, the price was only about $25 off from other 3 and 4 star hotels nearby. Just pay the little bit extra and get a real hotel. This place isn't worth it. Only positive is that the front desk staff who helped me check in and out were nice.

The booking was made through a third party site. The photographs of the accommodation did not make it clear how small the living space was for the room we booked, standard double. On arrival we realised how compact the room was. Having said that everything we needed was catered for. We had en suite facilities and although no wardrobe or other room furniture could be fitted in, there was sufficient hanging space and drawer space for the clothes we had brought with us. Whether this would be adequate for a longer stay, I'm not sure. The small bed was comfortable and both my wife and I, 50 years +, slept well. The room was clean tidy and kept very spic and span by the hotel service team. Reception staff were polite, courteous and helpful with information on the best transport options to the airport at the end of out stay.As our trip was for sight-seeing, we had no need of anything else from our accommodation and it fitted our needs very well. As had been said elsewhere the roof terrace is a real 'pull' for this hotel and the 'downtown' views of the surrounding streets, is fantastic, especially at night. We were disappointed that the garden area next to reception was closed for the duration of our stay. We used the cafe for breakfast. There are a variety of options and while I thought it was good value, the man behind the counter seemed very stressed and struggled to cope with the demand from other guests.To sum up, the accommodation is very compact, but having spoken to fellow travellers, no more than any other local accommodation and you cannot expect anymore if you wish to stay in Manhattan. The room was clean tidy and comfortable and owing to the nature of our trip, fitted our needs perfectly as we did not anticipate spending any significant time in it.","Kilmarnock, United Kingdom",2,4.0

Fortunately, three drawers on wheels have been placed under the bed – and we were able to fit most of our clothes into these, so that we no longer needed to open our suitcases. But again, space is very limited.Other than that the room has what we needed – however, except for a refrigerator. You can buy coffee and a bagel for breakfast at the café on the first floor – but a better option, we found, is to use Carol’s Café at the small but handsome Greenacre Park across the street.

Checkin was quick and there was a concierge to help you fine your way around the city. We could walk to the the Rockefeller Centre and Grand Central Terminal. We took close by subways to everything else.  We chose the Queen bed with bathroom. Our friends had a double bed and they found it very small. They had to crawl over each other to use the washroom at night. We had room on either side of the bed to get out . I think it was only about $20.00 a night more and well worth it. The washroom was small but everything worked well except the door. It did not stay shut . The shower was good and had dispensers for body soap, shampoo and conditioner. There were lots of towels and a hair dryer.  I bought wine at a close by liquor store and in the evening before walking to a restaurant we would would sit up on the roof with our friends and have a happy hour. That was a highlight.

It faced 51st St. The phone and desk chair both were broken when I arrived, but a very nice staffer soon remedied both of those minor problems. Otherwise, the room was fine. It was a bit noisy, as there seems now to be a pretty busy restaurant/nightlife scene between the hotel and 2nd Avenue. I was able to drown out the noise one night by shutting windows and using AC. Sunday night it was much quieter and I could leave the windows open (a rare luxury at a NYC hotel, and one that I value).The bell captain was very nice and helpful, booking my shuttle to return to LGA ($20, ride took 32 minutes).

I booked it so quick based on several reviews I saw & after booking the room was reviewing my reservation where I found out it said shared bathroom. I began to worry a bit and I'm sure had I knew this ahead of time I probably would opt out. But it worked out great. I stayed on the 8th floor, which has 4 bathrooms. The bathrooms were always available when I needed them and were all very clean. After checking out I realized that above the door, it has a notification section with four toilets and the lights light up when a bathroom becomes available. There is nearby parking. Though after parking several blocks away the front desk gentlemen told me I could park at any icon parking garage and I would get a discount. After parking at an icon garage 10 minutes walking distance away, i learned the hard way that the parking garage I chose was not one of the garages that provides a discount for my hotel. So I paid $60 for overnight stay parking (6pm sat-12pm Sunday). I was not very happy about this fee. Other than the guy telling me about any garage accepting the hotel parking stamp.

You can see my review of Blue Moon Boutique Hotel and avoid staying there. 4 reasons you should stay at this hotel:1) The Pod room of course! Their rooms are designed to make full use of space, very trendy and stylish. The bathroom towels are white and feels so clean. I stayed at the Full Pod room with my private shower. The room is tiny in space but big in all essential amenities. Full bedPrivate bathroom with rainfall showerhead - Awesome shower with good hot water option!

Air conditioning - a little noisy Two flat-screen TVs with cable channelsWork desk and chair2) Locationclose to a train line, many small bars around and next to the Pod. 3) Friendly staff4) Clean space and affordable. The only disappointment is that on their website they had advertised a rooftop bar at Pod 51. However, the reality is the rooftop bar is at Pod 39 so that was a little disappointing.

Beds are comfortable (I prefer a firmer mattress btw). Room is clean and is well maintained. The safe in my room wasn’t working so they sent a maintenance person up to fix…he was there in less that 10 minutes. The bathroom reminds me of a typical European bathroom (aka small). Which was perfect for my stay. The soap/shampoo dispensers in the shower were a nice added bonus.

I’ve recommend it to more than a dozen people here since my first stay. I would stay here mainly because it’s cheap and I spend no time in my room in NY. It’s small and not something to brag about. But after this experience, I think I’ll try other places before recommending or staying here again. The busboy was shady AF. We asked him explicitly to call us a TAXI to JFK because we were in a hurry and I’m 6’2”. That’s not what happened. Had He let us know upfront, not after we waited for 10 min then I wouldn't be pissed. We found out we are riding a super shuttle, with like 26” leg room.... since we were running super late, we couldn’t walk away. He kept saying it’s cheaper and we were like, we’re expensing it....and he didn’t even give us a receipt so I couldn’t expense it. My back hurts because was riding in a small van that is overflowing with people and luggage. We stopped at a few gates to drop off other passengers and we ran to our gate almost missing it. We asked for a Taxi and we got a headache instead. Not good service at all. Also this time, my room smelled like wet socks.

I knew there was more to this choice when my colleague asked if I had remembered to get a room with a private bathroom. Was I staying in a hostel and hotel combined? Evidently yes. In fairness to the staff, they were very polite and helpful. The property left much to be desired. I was lucky to have gotten an upgraded room which meant queen bed and some extra square feet of space and a bathroom with a tub. It required walking up a flight of steps through a section of the hotel not serviced by the elevator. For whatever reason the hallways had a musty odor but the room was fine. Old fashioned by today’s hotels the shower tub was not what the cool rainhead shower you see on the website. My colleagues did not get the upgrades and had very small rooms with even tinier bathrooms. They either had bunk bed singles or queens. No reason for beds to be so cheap in this day and age. Hostel yes, hotel no.The positives are the location which is near many bars and restaurants including one immediately on each side.I won’t be staying at any of the pods on business and at those prices I can’t see who is the target audience.","Raleigh, North Carolina",55,3.0

If you are looking for Tons of Space... or staying for an extended period of time... not sure this is what you are looking for. I stayed in a Queen Room by myself for 1 night. I contacted the property ahead of time and inquired about an early check-in (1:30 pm as opposed to 3p) and they were very accommodating. Room was very clean but it did have one of the smaller bathrooms I had seen (Room 520). Other rooms had a bit more space in the bathroom.... but for a night or two on a budget... No Problem. They have a snack bar in the lobby...which btw is always Very clean and Very well lit. There is also the Roof Top Bar but I have been to this property twice and have not had time to visit it. There is also a bar right off the lobby with an interior entrance. The bartending staff might be the nicest I have encountered in my time going to a bar. I hung out for 2 pints and a snack from their bar menu before meeting some coworkers. This bar also had an Old School Bubble Hockey Game (USA vs USSR) - loved this growing up and wished there was someone around to play. :) This POD also has a comfortable lounge in the lobby with a foosball table.

Captain's bed (twin) that had drawers underneath in place of a dresser. Surprised that the room included a teeny little desk and mid-century modern wire chair - nice touch. The elevators have piped-in music. Club like. The hallways are dark - didn't like that aspect. LOVED the rooftop patio - great views and you really know you're in the city when you're surrounded by all the other towers. Perfect selfie opportunity. Midtown location smack in the middle of everything else. Walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Saks, St. Patrick's, as well as Grand Central Station if you're feeling ambitious. Subway station close by, and also close to stops for the 2nd and 3rd Avenue buses. Made getting around town a breeze. I got injured during the trip - was obviously limping and in pain - staff didn't seem too concerned, so in that case, they lived down to the stereotype of the uncaring New Yorker. Also didn't care for the varying rates on billing the room depending on the day of the week - seemed that the booking service didn't mention that when I originally made my reservation. However, the convenience of the location outweighed my concerns. Will this be my first choice hotel when I return to the city?

Loved the individual tvs for each bunk bed, and having USB plug in points to charge mobile phones (negating the need for adaptor plugs for that). The only real negative is that we weren't able to get free Wi-Fi in our room for some reason but could get free wi fi in the lobby. The shared bathrooms didn't look quite the same as they did on the website but were still fine for what we needed. Also, the views from the rooftop deck were fab! Staff were all helpful and attentive on both check in, and check out - the staff let us store our luggage at the hotel during the day before our flight home, and also arranged for transport to the airport for us.Considering all of the above and the close location to the main attractions in midtown I would definitely recommend pod 51.",,4,4.0

Wi-Fi was excellent and TV in a good spot.The bathroom was really classy….. done in a kind of art deco styling. Very nice.It was obviously very cold in mid Feb’ so I only paid a brief visit to the roof-top terrace but it looks like it would be a perfect place to hang out during the summer. Very funky. Very New York.I was staying on my own and one of the real plus points for me was the relaxing vibe in the dining area on the ground floor. You could buy a bagel or muffin and some fruit with a decent coffee in the morning for about $15. Not cheap but nothing is cheap….Its New York…ha ha. The dining area was also a cool place for me to kick-back with a beer in the evening before I headed out. They had a decent choice of beers and plenty of ports to re-charge your phone. Also a very helpful and knowledgeable concierge was always on hand with free maps and advice about the best way to get around and the best places to see.Also if you are staying for a few days I can highly recommend the Indian restaurant Amma which is right next door. I visited 3 times while I was there and tasted some of their very best Indian dishes. The staff were lovely and even though I was on my own I wasn’t made to feel the slightest bit uncomfortable or hurried. Highly recommended.The location of the Pod was also another big plus. It’s a few blocks away from the heart of New York but close enough to a couple of Subway stations so all of the sights of New York are within easy reach.I will definitely use Pod 51 as a base to explore New York if I ever return. ,Gibraltar,32,5.0

I was travelling by myself with my own money to a conference, so I wanted an inexpensive place close to the conference location.I reserved a room with a single bed, shower, and toilet. Some rooms have shared bathrooms. The room was great. They come across as sort of a hip boutique hotel so the spartan fittings work well. Everything was clean and the staff was professional.The hotel attracts budget travellers and on my first night there it sounded like some young party types were in the mood to be really noisy. After a while I heard someone come ask them to be quiet and they did. Other than that I had no issues. The doors are very thin so you hear other doors slamming. There was also a party going on in a nearby bar that was loud, but it didn't bother me. I think people who are overly sensitive to noise may not like it here. I have pretty normal tolerances to being annoyed and it was fine.The shower was really good. It had a big overhead shower head and was way above average for a hotel shower.I reserved on their website and got a couple of glasses of wine as a result. That was nice too. They held my luggage for me on my last day. The room was made up every day nicely.This place might not be the best for business travellers. There is no iron or ironing board in the room although I suspect you could borrow one. There's not a lot of space to do any ironing anyway.I think it's perfect for my situation.

It was one of the best value options we found. You could go anywhere by foot (knowing of course that Manhattan is huge and it means that you will daily walk a lot haha). We arrived around 9 am in the hotel and they said that we could check in early because there were rooms available and it would not have an extra cost. The first room we were offered though was really weird, once the bathroom had a strange layout and you could not sit in the toilet without having your knees to touch a corner in the wall - the shower also had a low pressure, so we asked them to change rooms (our request was promptly attended, no issues). The second one was fine but I feel like I need to give you a ""heads up"" about the bathroom... Our shower had a totally transparent glass wall, which in our case was fine, but if you're not traveling with your partner and ask for a double room it can be very awkward. The bathroom door was also an issue, once it sealed the toilet space and it was not totally closing, so we had to use a bag to ""seal it"" and make who was inside more confortable. The bed was okay and there was a sink outside the bathroom, which worked fine for us. The room is very small (NY reality), but we could make it work. A nice thing was that we ordered some things online and by the end of the day, when we got to the room the deliveries were there waiting for us already without any additional fee. It's important to mention though that in case your deliveries arrive before you check in, they're gonna charge you USD 25 per package.

The entrance is very deceiving, it gives the impression of a hip & modern hotel as described but then you get in the lift and it takes a drastic turn. We stayed on the third floor which seemed pretty full, i only know this because i could hear everyone in their rooms very clearly! Paper thin is an understatement. The corridor is dimly lit and narrow and it struck me as a breeding ground for your average serial killer. On entering the room itself you only need to take two steps to reach the end and a quarter then to touch the bathroom, touch the bed and touch the desk all at once. Now i know the manager will say , its New York they're all small but this really is bordering on the ridiculous if there's more than just yourself. The decor is very basic and you get no luxuries like a kettle but that is what is advertised. However the price it charges is so overpriced for what is simply a dank hostel! The sheets and pillows smell of stale bodies and the view is diabolical, a broken roof covered in rubbish! I would suggest getting some cheap astro turf and a cheap plastic dog to make it more aesthetically pleasing.

We usually opt for shared WC in Europe, so the concept wasn't new. And just like there, it's no big deal to slip on your flip flops and walk a few doors down.

There's an outdoor space (I was here during a rainy weekend, didn't check it out), and you're literally right in the middle of all NYC has to offer. It's walking distance to Grand Central, and you can take the AirTrain/E to 53rd and Lexington, just a few short blocks away, for $7.75 each way. Eat falafel or hot dogs for a few of your meals, and you've got the cheapest New York City vacation imaginable.True, amenities are scant. But you shouldn't be in your room anyway. And the staff are lovely, beds comfy, rooms and WCs clean. Five dots!","Atlanta, Georgia",125,5.0

We stayed on the 8th floor which has 4 shared bathrooms and we never had to wait to use the bathrooms at all. The bathrooms have secure locks so you feel safe that you won't be disturbed.In fact, having the shared bathrooms was a positive as it meant we could both get ready for the day at the same time and didn't have to wait for each other to finish.

I choose Pod 51 because at the time it was the highest reviewed hotel at the $200 price range. I scanned some of the reviews and the ones I read were all gushing. What I didn’t realize was the bathroom is shared and it is shared by the entire floor of twenty rooms or so. There are only two bathrooms per floor from what I saw on the 14th floor where I stayed. Because I paid $200 for the room I find this ridiculous. I also noticed when I checked in the same room could be booked for $79. I feel totally hoodwinked. The staff are friendly, the location is excellent near Rockefeller center but the rooms are so tiny and the bathroom situation unbearable. If I was single and on a low budget and could get the room for $80 then I would be happy. But I am way past the age where I need to share a bathroom with a whole floor of people. The worst part is that for $200 I could have gotten a private bathroom at another hotel. I think the reviews here are good because budget travelers who actually got a budget rate get good value. Do not pay a premium rate and be prepared to rough it. The bathroom is so small and there is not even a counter to set your clothes or toiletries on. The body soap bottle on the shower wall was completely empty so I had to peak my head out the door and beg a housekeeper to bring me soap. Beware!","Clovis, California",21,3.0

Previously I've stayed in a bunk with shard bathroom and a single with shared bathroom.On this occasion I booked a double with private bathroom and for me it worked great. The only thing to be aware of is there isn't a great deal of privacy if your not traveling alone. The shower is separated from the main room by a shower curtain and frosted glass door. Also, the toilet just by the frosted glass door. Another thing, the bed is sideways and doesn't have a headboard. It's a weird little setup but guess it makes the most of a small space. Be aware it is a small room but this is as cheap a hotel as you are going to get in Manhattan... and that is why.On my 3 stays, dating back to 2013, the hotel has always been clean and really hasn't shown any sign of ageing. Staff are friendly and helpful.On this occasion I thought that there was quite a lot of noise from hallway, particularly doors slamming. It's not something I remember from past visits but possibly some sort of door closer would stop them from slamming?

There is a desk, a small bed with a very hard and unpleasant mattress and a sink. My biggest issue with the room was the noise. My room was on the second floor, and right outside my window (with no view) there were a number of AC units which I assume contributed to the constant noise that was impossible to get rid of. The TV was okay, and there was Wi-Fi, but otherwise not much in term of amenities. The room rate promised red wine at check in, but I didn't see any of that. There is no restaurant or anything on site either. You are getting a very no-frills experience. The room had four shared bathrooms. One of them, with a shower, had literally no space for placing your clothing. I'm not sure what they were thinking. That their guests would walk around naked in the public hallways?

I booked the single pod with shared washrooms. My tldr review: staying here is a compromise between price, room size, and location. Pods and washrooms were clean. Price is much cheaper than other Manhattan hotels; I also booked two months in advance. The pod is much smaller than a regular hotel room. Location is fantastic. Would stay again.(I didn't use the lobby cafe or patio.)ROOM: The pod is very small, only meant as a place to sleep. Room includes sink, mirror, towels, tv and desk. Room was clean, housekeeping was good. The air conditioner can be quite loud, but as I sleep best with white noise I did not mind it at all. Two complaints: 1) Mattress is too firm for my tastes. 2) Poor sound isolation between the room and the hallway. The sound of the door closing is very loud, and sometimes I was awoken by the loud slam of doors down the hallway very late at night.WASHROOM: There four washrooms per floor. There are lights in the room to indicate when a washroom is being used. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash is provided in the washrooms. Washrooms were quite busy during morning and evening hours. They were clean for the most part, even with the heavy use during the long weekend. However the floor can get wet after showering as there is no shower mat or floor drain. In one washroom the previous user laid down tissue paper to soak the water, but it just turned into a soggy mess. Definitely recommend wearing shower flip flops. I would also recommend checking out each washroom as they all have different layouts, and some are more spacious than others.LOCATION: Within walking distance to UN Plaza, St. Paul’s cathedral, Rockefeller Plaza, Grand Central Station, and Times Square. At night the area is quiet (but not sketchy). There are two nearby subway stations serving multiple subway lines. Steps away from the hotel there is a bagel shop that seems to be a major destination for locals and tourists alike – although the line was always an hour long when I went out for breakfast.","Toronto, Canada",1,4.0

You defiantly get what you pay for. We booked a double room with a private bathroom and the room was tiny. Suitable for one person. Not big enough for two people and luggage. Our first night in the hotel was just the worst night we've had. The room was very warm, we couldn't put the air con because it was so noisy. The noise from the street was unbearable and there was a constant noise from the main air con unit what supplies the hotel. Then to top it off our room was next to the communal bathroom which was in constant use all night with the doors being slammed. It got to the point when we realised we wasn't going to get any sleep so I went to reception to ask if we could be moved to a room towards the back of the hotel. The receptionist wasn't much help, he just said he couldn't do anything and he came to check the noise in our room and just said that's the noise so you will have to deal with it. So after a sleepless night we went to ask again at the reception and this time a different receptionist was very helpful. He gave us two rooms to go and have a look at to see which one we thought would be better. We chose 702. It was the same size room but the noise levels were considerably lower and we managed to get a good sleep. So overall it is a budget hotel, don't expect anything amazing from it. The location is good for all the main attractions. ",,4,2.0

The room was very small, but well designed and it had everything I needed. There were plenty of outlets in the room for charging devices. The full bathroom was definitely compact, but again, everything I would expect from a more luxurious hotel was there, which was good because this place isn't cheap, even though it is on the more budget end for NYC.The space was very tight. I'm one person, and very average sized. If I had been traveling with my partner, who is 6'3"", I suspect there could have been a lot of issues, particularly with the bed and shower stall.I had read other reviews that mentioned that the walls were super thin so noise was a real problem, so I was concerned, but that turned out to not be an issue. I rarely heard my neighbors. The hotel staff were fantastic. The little cafe in the lobby was great for grabbing a quick breakfast in the morning. The seating areas were comfortable, with both indoor and outdoor seating.The hotel offers ""Podwalks"" Monday through Friday, where they have a tour guide from a local tour company do a walking tour that takes most of the morning. I did the Thursday tour, which is Chelsea Market/Meatpacking District/Greenwich Village and it was excellent. The tours are free, though I did tip my guide generously at the end.The hotel itself is very colorful and fun. There is music piped in all the elevators, and the entire hotel is very artsy. The rooftop deck is nice, though the building is significantly smaller than other buildings in Midtown, so it isn't a great view for sightseeing. But it is a lovely space to hang out and enjoy a glass of wine.The hotel also offers a $40 flat rate car service to the airport, which I found more convenient, quicker, and cheaper than the taxi I arrived in.The only complaint I have is that it was unseasonably hot when I was there and the air conditioner in my room wasn't the greatest. It did work, but not exceptionally well. Had it been typical September weather, rather than a heatwave, it wouldn't have been an issue at all.","Denver, Colorado",29,3.0

When I asked to borrow a plastic bowl so I could hand wash some clothes, they said they didn't have one. I think that a hotel which presents itself as a budget hotel should have this option.4. There was no shared fridge - also something I think a budget hotel should have.5.

The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The rooftop had a great view of the city, but they did not have a bar up there like I thought so bring your own drinks! My only issue with this hotel was the bathroom situation. I got a room with one full bed and a ""private"" bathroom (They had a shared bathroom with about 4 other rooms for cheaper). We paid extra for the private bathroom, but they only had one sliding glass door to cover the toilet AND the shower. So to take a shower you would have to cover the toilet side to unchange, then do an awkward shimmey into the shower while sliding the glass door to the other side so you wouldn't flash your roommates. A simple second curtain or door would have fixed this issue!

It was like two smaller rooms put together plus some space! Two tvs and two desks and our own bath. The rooms are clean, chic and comfy. I love the shower stalls and high pressure showers. The locations is great - not too touristy - not too residential. With the Morning Star Cafe a half a block one way and Ess-a-Bage the other way - how can you go wrong.

I rented a single room. I had a twin bed (mediocre comfort level) clean sheets and towels, IKEA desk and chair, and an airplane size sink. I would estimate my room was about 50 square feet. THIS WAS FINE! The room was great, clean, good smell, nice TV. Only complaint in the room would be that the actual door to my room was quite THIN, more of a bedroom door, than a hotel door. made me a bit uncomfortable since my head was 3 feet from it while sleeping.My issue is the community bathroom. the positive: LIGHTS illuminate above your hotel door when community restrooms are occupied. This is nice in that you do not have to make multiple trips to busy restrooms to relieve yourself or get clean. the negative(S): So, the community water closets are the size of a ... water closet, in your home. EXTREMENLY SMALL. which is fine, however if I were overweight, I would not be able get in, and close the door... The issue is that they are NOT designed for multiple person or continuous use. there is NOTHING to sanitize between uses, or even control SMELL (just being real). and the showers with cloth curtains allow water to spread across the tile floor in the small restroom, with no drain, no towels, so its impossible to even clean after yourself, upon leaving. These community restrooms are a fine idea, but at $165 on a friday night... You better have it clean for me. its not a youth hostel pricepoint. The idea is a great one,but they have alot of work to do to make the financial commitment match the minimal amenities. P>S> I would NEVER stay here as a couple, or two to a room. just. too. small.

I struggled over the rating because there are things about this hotel that are really good, and some that are really not. I decide to split the baby and go with average.First of all, Pod 51 will not be for everyone. It worked well for us because when we travel, our hotel serves as a place to sleep, change, and shower. We don’t hang out at the hotel or entertain in our room. That means that we don’t need a large room or tons of amenities, we’d rather go small and simpler and pay less. Other reviews complain about the postage-stamp size room (I would estimate the main area of the room to be around 100 – 120 square feet), but that’s what a pod hotel is. There were a few amenities that we would have liked, but we did fine without them and preferred the lower cost. Things sacrificed in the name of space and cost include: a refrigerator, microwave, alarm clock (I always use my phone anyway), ironing board and iron, and maybe another thing or two that I’m forgetting. But again, I’d rather not pay more for those.Here’s the good stuff. Even though the room is very small, the space utilization is pretty efficient. There are drawers in the platform bed, a couple of small shelves, and a small but functional desk. There is also a small alcove closet with no door (a smart move, it makes the space more usable). One complaint I always have about hotels is that you have to turn on every light in the room (usually six or so) and it’s still dark. Being small, the overhead ceiling light provides ample light. There are also two bedside lights and the natural light from the windows is great. The room is very modern, with a hip, industrial-minimalist feel to it. There is a nice area downstairs to hang out if you need some space, with a garden patio and rooftop seating, so if the pod starts feeling claustrophobic, you have a place to go. The hotel is very conveniently located, there are subway stations nearby, plenty of decent restaurants and bars, a good bagel place, a pharmacy, and plenty of retail in the area. It’s an easy walk to Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and other stuff. With the subway so close, nothing is too far away. The staff is friendly and helpful, the concierge was able to give us good directions and advice.We had a room with a private bath (I’m way beyond my communal bathroom days). While small, the bathroom was functional enough (I’ll say more later) and they provide shampoo in the little bottles even though they have the dispensers with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower—I hate those so I appreciated the bottles and bar soap being there without having to ask. Due to the limited space, the faucet and spout is wall mounted with a gooseneck; this is great because you don’t have to stick your hands into the sink to use the water. I wish more hotels would do this.The free wi-fi worked well and was fast. The room itself, despite its size is quire comfortable. The A/C worked well, the beds were comfortable, and while there was a bit of noise from doors opening and closing (more than normal due to the community bathrooms in the halls) the place was quiet, not much street noise. Overall, Pod 51 served us well.But… there were some negatives as well. Most of these are minor, but some are a bit more significant. First is that while I understand that it’s a pod and it will have a pod bathroom, it is VERY small. My wife and I are not very big, and we were cramped in that bathroom. Seriously, if you are a large person, the bathroom could be an issue. Excuse the visual, but if you’re on the commode, your knees may be pressed against the door. The shower is miniscule, I was constantly banging my arms against the tile while soaping up and rinsing off. There is a light that juts out from the wall at elbow height that I kept knocking with my elbow. Luckily I’m fairly short or I’d hit my head on the rain style showerhead (the showerhead is actually pretty nice). The stainless steel counter has little room to keep your toiletries and such, and if you leave then there, they’re going to get wet. One amenity that I missed was that they don’t give you washcloths, just hand and bath towels. There is only one hook to hang a towel and it’s really for a place to put your towel so you can grab it after a shower. Your hand towels have to sit on the counter where they’ll get wet, there’s nowhere to hang wet towels.Now this one I can’t figure out. The bathroom door is a frosted glass sliding door, barn door style. When you close the door, the part of the wall between the bedroom and bathroom that get exposed has a window—not frosted glass or some sort of privacy glass—clear glass. Yes, there’s a clear glass window that puts the person in the bathroom on stage. So, you can either keep the door open, or let people see what’s going on through the window. Bottom line is that there is NO privacy in the bathroom. WHAT were they thinking??At first, when we closed the bathroom door, it would just slide back open. If you were on the commode (again, sorry for the visual), you had to hold the door closed with your hands or foot. This leads to another problem, we left the next morning and asked to have someone fix the door. Upon our return late afternoon, nobody had come to fix it. I called and they said that someone would be right up. We wanted to shower, but held off because he was supposedly on his way. Over an hour later, he came. The maintenance guy fixed it in less than a minute. It shouldn’t have taken two calls, and “right up” is not an hour.Quite frankly, housekeeping could have been better. The first day, they didn’t dispose of the used plastic cups, replace the shampoo bottles, or empty the “ice bucket” (more on that in a second). When we checked in, there was a spare roll of toilet paper, the next day it was gone, never to be replaced. The room was basically clean, but not replenished. The next day they did bring additional shampoo, however, we had to wipe off the faucet because residual cleanser was on it—they didn’t wipe it off well.Here’s one of my biggest complaints: they do not give you ice buckets because there is no ice machine. You have to ask for ice from the coffee kiosk attached to the restaurant for ice. If you need ice after 10:00pm closing, it appears you’re out of luck. When you request ice, they will only give you a little disposable container about the size of a quart container you’d get filled with potato salad from the deli. The use full size cubes instead of crushed ice, so you don’t get a lot in the container. It is a battle-royal for them to give you more. Complaining to the front desk just gets you the information that the coffee kiosk is separate from the hotel and they have no control over it. Even the worst fleabag motel has an ice machine. This is one missing amenity that is not excusable. It is irrelevant to me who manages what. You should be able to get as much ice as you need 24/7. My first fit yielded me a stainless steel wine bottle holder of ice, which was OK, but not being an ice bucket, it melted quickly.

Check-in was easy. People were very nice. Quick trip up the elevator. Since rooms are small, hallways look almost like a line of phone booths. (Well, not really that close together.) Room was efficiently laid out - tight but everything you needed was there. You need to be organized and use the space efficiently as a result, however. Good shower, lots of hot water. Bed mostly comfortable. Small TV but fine for my purposes. Quite cost-effective for mid-town. Be prepared to walk. While this hotel is on 51st St, it is pretty far over on the east side, almost to 2d Avenue, so if you need to go over to Broadway or 6th Avenue, it is a but of a hike. It is also a hike from Penn Station, but not so much from Grand Central. I only had two complaints. First, the security seemed a little loose. It seemed that anyone could come in the front door and go right up on the elevator to any floor. This could be easily fixed by having someone attentive right at the elevator to deter outsiders. Second, the sink was aligned on a wall in the main room, but was not very deep front to back, and as a result, water kept splashing on the floor, which was carpeted. That was a bit distasteful when you think about the number of times that must occur, day after day.

The room doesn't have a clock radio or a hook to hang your towel on but does provide everything else. the bed is on the firm side but was reasonably comfortable.the rooms aren't well soundproofed from the corridor noise - I never heard noise from my neighbors rooms but I did hear doors banging and any louder conversations in the corridor. normally not a problem except when a couple had a domestic at 2am.The compromise to get this price was a shared bathroom and its condition really depends on who you are sharing the floor with. I found it mostly OK, except that I had to double check the seat and floor in front of the seat was clean every single time (as men leave residue on the floor) which was a pain in the middle of the night but part of the deal. The cleaning staff did try their best to keep the area clean each morning. The bathroom areas are like ensuites in a home, compact.

Cons: TINY, yes I know it's a pod hotel, but c'mon. For the price I paid, not worth it. I was woken ALL night with people opening and closing their doors going to the communal bathrooms. Take that into account when you book... even if you get a room with a private bath, as I did, the constant noise in the halls at all hours is a deal breaker. No insulation. No counter space in the bathroom, tiny shower and sink. Live and learn. Would not stay again.","Los Angeles, California",9,3.0

Check-in was smooth, very pleasant staff, super clean rooms and a prime location in midtown. For the price we definitely feel we got good value. My main feedback for the hotel would be design, design design! My husband and I knew the rooms would be on the small side, but we both agreed that a few changes to the room could have improved the experience immensely. For example we found the oversized bedframe to be quite unnecessary in such a small space and we kept smacking our shins on it on the way to the bathroom. The ledge at the head of the bed was also a bit weird - I wouldn't be surprised to hear a lot of people bonked their heads on that. Why not get rid of it? The wooden shutters on the window with the AC unit wouldn't close, so they stuck way into the room and my husband found it annoying. Replace those things with some sleek panel blinds and you're golden! I think Pod51 is a good hotel but with a couple of changes to the room design it could be made far more functional, especially for couples.","Vancouver, Canada",7,4.0

On this trip I was pleasantly surprised that the E & M trains are just a few stops from LaGuardia airport's shuttle bus service. Check in was smooth, the room was just right, and while this was the first time I've used shared bathrooms, there was never a time that they weren't unavailable for use. The cleaning staff was on point As they were at Pod 39.

I will say that the shared bathrooms which we approached with some trepidation were an absolute stand out. They were some of the cleanest I've ever seen at a hotel, the shower had awesome pressure and we never had an issue waiting around for one to become available (it was the off season). I did enjoy the lights in the room that indicated whether the bathrooms were occupied so you didn't have to actually leave your room to look. Also there were multiple bathrooms per floor.

There was a washbasin inside the room (i.e. no need to leave the room every time you want to wash your hands or brush your teeth). Our floor had four shared bathrooms, which were clean at all times. You can also see which bathrooms are in use from your room to avoid queues. Overall, the hotel feels very modern and even has a garden and a roof terrace.The main drawback was the noise. Manhattan is bustling 24/7 and the windows aren't great at keeping the noise out. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to bring a pair of ear plugs.

The staff were so friendly, and the hotel is about a 20 minute walk away from all the tourist spots (Times Square, Central Park, Top of the Rock). There is a cute little cafe up the block called Treehaus which we visited most days for breakfast. They do a lovely breakfast buffet which you can eat in or take out.

I wouldn't be complaining about any of the following if I had paid $80 a night. However, Pod 51 is charging $220 for their cells. The positives: It was clean. The staff was friendly. The location is perfect. They store/hold your luggage before checking in or out. The negatives: It was like sleeping in an MRI machine. You could sit on the bed and touch the shower, toilet and sink. When you showered the entire room filled with steam and condensation. There was no privacy in using either the toilet or the shower. (I'm not a prude, but there are some things I like to keep a mystery in my marriage...like the face I make when I'm pooping.) We stayed on the second floor, and all day we heard music coming from either another room or the restaurant downstairs. At 8am every morning, housekeeping would start knocking on people's doors to clean, and even though our room wasn't being cleaned, we heard everyone elses get cleaned. I have multiple bruises on my shins from repeatedly bumping into the bed. There wasn't room for two suitcases, only one. There was construction happening on their roof, so we heard that all day and weren't able to make use of the patio.If you find a good deal, like under $100 a night, then it's worth staying. If you're traveling alone, or you're young and just don't care, this is a great option. Otherwise, find another hotel.","Boston, Massachusetts",13,3.0

The continual slamming of doors was annoying as well. It doesn't help that the rooms are so close to one another. The room was very small, but fine for three nights. I'm glad I booked a double room with a private bathroom. Nothing bad against the hotel. If you are not a light sleeper and don't mind noise then you'll be fine. Outside noise was minimal and didn't bother me. If I could make a suggestion it's that they change the mattress.

We got exactly what they said we would get. I opted for the room with a bunk bed. We had a small sink with a mirror and window and the bathroom was in the hallway. Above the door are lights to tell you when the bathrooms are available. We never had to wait and the bathrooms were clean and well-appointed. The room was tiny--like an interior room on a cruise ship--but the beds and linens were comfortable. Each bed had its own light and tiny flat screen TV. We did see other rooms that looked larger and had their own bathrooms. Our air conditioner wasn't working well.

When we compared prices to other hotels in the area, this met our needs quite well. The elevator and corridors could have been cleaned more, and the desk and concierge were ok. Go in with an open mind and don't plan to spend a lot of time in there, especially if you're claustrophobic. When it comes to sight seeing, totally recommend going first thing in the morning for tours: less people and no overcrowding.

Good size and sturdy looking safe in room.

I don't think my room, with a private bathroom and full sized bed, was a good deal. The bunk bed rooms with a shared (outside of room) bathroom are a much better deal. Depending on the time of year, that kind of room costs as little as $75 a night. However, if you don't want to get dressed to walk down a poorly lit hallway to make a 2 a.m. trip to the bathroom, or own shower slippers, upgrading to a room with a private bathroom will cost substantially more money, and is not worth it. Check TripAdvisor--a room in a Hilton Garden Inn with a queen or even a king sized bed could be had a for only a few dollars more and they throw in free wifi and free breakfast. There is no free breakfast option at Pod51. You can go next door to Salvation Burger and pay $4.00 for a bagel or walk a few blocks down 3rd Avenue to eat at Ess a Bagel or Starbucks. Additionally, although the neighborhood is nice, the selection of subways is limited. The M train does not run on the weekends, the 6 train is an unreliable local, and the E train is constantly being rerouted due to Hurricane Sandy repairs. Something to think about when picking a hotel for sightseeing.On the plus side, the service was good (although my ""free glasses of wine"" never materialized, and I was originally given the keys to an occupied room) and the hotel was spotlessly clean.

The first two nights were at the new Marriott Fairfield Inn at 58th and 10th as the rates were $118 and $154 for the first two nights. However, a combination of Christmas and some event raised rates to over $400 at almost all of the chain hotels. I had researched POD 51 and their rate was $126 for two nights. As usual I will list the PROS and CONS:1. Value. $126 vs. $400 no brainer provided you are one person and only plan to sleep there. If a Marriott or other chain was $150-$175 I would stay there instead.2. Quiet. Location is on 51st street between 2nd and 3rd Avenue. I requested and received an inside room and never heard a thing except when people shut their doors in the a.m..3. Location. Easy walking to most things and Metro is at 53rd and Lexington (E train) which goes right to JFK.CONS:1. Incredibly small rooms even by New York Standards. Bare bones basic, though the tiny TV mounted on the wall received a very clear picture. 2. I had a ""full size"" bed which was a bigger than a single and smaller than a double.In summary, if you are one person, only plan on sleeping there and other hotels are much more expensive this is a good choice. If you are a couple and/or plan on spending considerable time in the room you might consider another venue.One tip, Ess-A-Bagel is right around the corner on 3rd Avenue.

As with my previous stay everything was as expected, nothing fancy but clean and well presented... pretty much what you'd expect at the budget end of the Manhattan hotel market. If anything I was pleasantly surprised with the size of my Pod, much bigger than the previous twin I'd been in.Previously I'd noted that there was very few limited power sockets, that wasn't an issue this time. Also, your room comes with small sink, safe, basic toiletries, hair dryer and TV.Shared bathrooms might be an issue for some but they are always clean and during an 11 night stay I only once had a short wait for a bathroom to become available. I was on floor 14 and there was only two shared bathrooms on that floor. I know on other floors there is up to 4. One minor thing in the bathrooms, it wouldn't hurt to have an extra hook on the wall/door to keep things off the floor.Location is good for getting around Manhattan by subway and Times Square, Rockerfeller centre and Central Park are within comfortable walking distance. And it's really easy getting to and from JFK with subway (direct line from Airtrain and cost just under $8).There are a number of small eateries/bars on 51st and just around the corner and also Duanne Reade just block away (right next to subway), handy for drinks, snacks etc.On this occasion I didn't take advantage of the free tours the hotel put on but have previously.

The hotel is only a 2 minute walk from Lexington subway station and was very easy to find with the help of google maps. Upon entering the hotel there was some quite music playing in the reception and the whole atmosphere was very relaxed. The gentleman on reception was very nice and after taking my credit card information gave me my key with no fuss and told me what floor my room was on.First of all the lifts are very slow and have a mind of their own. Allow a few extra minutes if you are in a rush as they do like to take their time however this is only a minor issue. The room itself was very small however the whole premise of this hotel is compartmental living so it was to be expected. As it was just me staying in the room the bed was only just a bit bigger than your standard single (i believe in the US this is called a twin) however it was comfy enough for me. The tv in the room did make this odd buzzing noise when the sound was turned up to an audible level but it wasn't too bad.The communal, shared, bathrooms were very clean and easily accessible. You didn't have to wait at all to use them and in your room you have a little display above the door that tells you when they are engaged to save you a trip. The Hotel itself is geographically a short walk from all the action in times square and there are plenty of taxis nearby to get you there faster. Make sure you know the address of the hotel as some taxi drivers don't know the hotel,to avoid this i used Uber for the majority of my trip.Overall this is a very nice hotel with a fantastic location, great for the budget traveler.","Manchester, United Kingdom",5,5.0

The bathroom was miniscule but stylish, and it serves its purpose: there's a small shower, a toilet, a tiny sink and mirror. What more do you need? There is a place to get a simple breakfast in the morning. It is on a quiet street, and the windows have shutters that really block out the light. It is really quite inexpensive, especially for NYC.

Many folks letting doors slam shut. Late Sunday night, a few folks were yelling and laughing in the hallway. It only went on for 15 minutes, so it wasn't too bothersome. The hallways are a bit too dark. Plus, there seems to be some work being done outside. The scaffolding was directly outside my window. Some staff members were friendlier than others.

I was a little wary of the latter but although it was obviously less convenient, it was also kept extremely clean and I never had to wait - not once in my entire stay.The staff aren't going to win any awards for exceptional warmth, but this is a minor point.

But the two Pod hotels are a not-so-secret third option for travelers that don't want to blow their budget on a bed for the night (or stay at a chain motel on the flyway path for JFK). After Hotel17 cancelled my reservation with no explanation and only a few days' notice, I scrambled to find a comparatively priced (under $200/night) room. A friend recommended Pod51 in Midtown, and I was lucky to get a ""single pod"" room at the last minute. The room was bright, clean, and West Elm/IKEA chic, with all the necessaries packed stylishly into a very small space. (As a former Manhattan studio apartment dweller, I'm used to snug quarters.) Comfortable bed with storage drawers underneath, useful little desk, sink and mirror, plenty of towels, open closet, wall TV, plenty of outlets. There's a separate clean, private toilet/shower room for every few hotel rooms, for those (like my single room) that don't include an in-room bathroom. (Each bathroom has a lock and is used by only one person at a time, so while the bathrooms are technically ""shared"" there won't be anyone but you inside when you're using them.) The busy, slightly scruffy cafe/lounge downstairs offers good croissants, coffee, and other breakfast/snack basics. Clientele was all kinds of people--older, younger, both foreign and American. Definitely not just a 20-somethings hostel. CAVEAT: if you're on a hallway w/ shared bathrooms, bring earplugs! The door to my room had a wide opening at the bottom, so I could hear the loud, metallic clanging of the bathroom doors opening and closing down the hall throughout the night.

We wanted a hotel that was relatively inexpensive, clean, and close to public transportation since we'd be spending most of our time seeing the sights. Pod 51 met our needs. ROOM:We stayed in the Queen Pod Room so we had our own bathroom. We didn't find the room to be too small as we were really only there to sleep. However, the bathroom was a little tight. The sink and toilet area were as big as an airplane bathroom. I'm a petite woman and found myself uncomfortably close to the shower walls many times. The rain-head shower was not as luxurious as I thought mainly because you were either directly under the water or inches away from the shower walls. Regardless, the water was always hot and had good pressure. Our room didn't come with wash cloths and when we asked for some, we were told they didn't have any as they run out of them quickly. The bed was clean and comfortable and we only had one night where our neighbors down the hall were having a loud argument that could be heard clearly in our room. We stayed on the 7th floor and hardly heard any street noise despite being in the city. LOCATION:The hotel is walking distance (less than 5 minutes) to 2 subway stations.

The room was so much better than we thought it would be. Although quite small, which was to be expected, this was not an issue at all. Each bunk had it's own good-sized TV at the end of it and a compartment in the wall for charging phones etcThere was also a small desk and chair in the room, a safe, and a sink with a mirror and plenty of towels. There was also a place to hang up clothes.The fact that we had a shared bathroom was not an issue at all. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor and we never had to wait to use one. There was only ever 1 or 2 being used at any 1 time. The bathrooms themselves were very nice, they varied slightly in size but all had powerful showers with lovely hot water and were cleaned regularly. The thing that we were particularly impressed with was the fact that our room was cleaned every day, as well as our beds being made and towels replaced. This was not something we expected at all. The thing to really mention about this hotel is the amazing roof deck! It has the most amazing views of the surrounding skyscrapers and really makes you feel like you're in the heart of NY. It's great to just sit there and take in the views. The location of the hotel is great as well, it's on the upper east side, and is about a 15/20 minute walk to Times Square and 15 minute walk to Central Park. Other places of interest such as Greenwich Village are about an hours walk away, but this is not an issue if you feel like walking there because there's always things to take in and explore when walking around the city. The closest subway is about a 3 mins walk away (53rd Street, Lexington Avenue) so that's really handy for those times when you don't feel like walking. All in all we had an excellent stay, the hotel was very clean and comfortable and has everything you could possibly need. It's perfect as a place to come back to have a good sleep after a long day exploring the city.The other thing to mention is that the hotel is in a very safe area so it would not be a problem for solo travelers. The hotel also provides free fast wifi which is also very handy. We will definitely be staying at this hotel again and we highly recommend it, especially considering how affordable it is!Tip: If you are coming in to NYC via JFK airport and want a straight forward cheap way of getting to the hotel, then get the airtrain from the airport to Jamaica Station, and then get the E subway train to 53rd Street Lexington Avenue.

If you are going to New York as a tourist then how much time do you plan to spend in your room anyway?This hotel is well located for seeing the sites and I found the price to be very reasonable considering the location. It is in easy walking reach of Times Square and Central Park and is the right side of Manhattan for JFK Airport. Manhattan in general is easy to walk around and it only takes between an hour and a half to two hours to walk from the hotel ""all the way down"" to Battery Park and the ferry to the Statue of Liberty.If you don't fancy the walk then there are bus stops and a Metro stop just over a block away.We had a room with its own bathroom and while this was a bit of a squeeze it was clean and tidy. The staff do a good job of looking after the rooms and I did sneak a look in a shared bathroom as I walked past and these also looked in good order.The bed was a small double but comfortable and my only criticism would be that the air conditioning was quite noisy. I slept well regardless.I did not make use of the food facilities on site but did visit the roof which is a great place to relax after a busy day and has some great views as it goes dark.There a couple of shops within a short walk where you can get supplies and a 24 hour McDonalds at the end of the block if you do wake up at 4.30am and need a coffee - there were no facilities in the room.The hotel staff were great. Booking in and out was easy. Often after booking out staff lose a little interest but when it came to sorting us a car to the airport they could not have been better. Traffic was horrendous and they helped us with our cases to the end of the block and made several calls to chase our car, stopping with us until it arrived. The hotel does free guided tours which appeared worth a look.

Easy access to subways and Grand Central, but do yourself a favor and download the free shared-ride app (VIA) and ride anywhere in Manhattan for about $5 (much less than Uber and no rush hour surcharges). Lots of great eateries nearby (Barkogi around the corner and try their fried chicken, Socarrat around the corner for Spanish tapas and happy hour, Sukhumvit Thai etc.). Two staff members really stand out: Brian who is the concierge and Maria who helps with reservations. Kudos to them. While many hotels have rooftop bars etc, Pod 51 has a great rooftop that you can access to free! You can grab a glass of wine or beer from the downstairs' lobby and bring a picnic up and watch the sunset. They also serve the famous Essa-bagels (the deli is right around the corner but the Pod charges less and you don't have to wait in line for 45 minutes!). There is also an outdoor patio on the lobby level and a fussball table in the lobby as well as ipads mounted into the wall where you can pull up info and print out boarding passes etc. My favorite ""pocket park"" is across the street next to the synagogue. Great place to hang out and decompress and listen to the sounds of the waterfall. The rooms are compact but very smartly designed with underbed drawers, plenty of hangers in the two small closets with shelf, a safe, a long built-in table desk for working/eating. Compact bathroom with shower and toilet. Sink is in the room and the only thing I would change would be to put a towel hook to the left and right of the sink for hanging used handtowels. We had a room with two queen beds and our own bathroom. Other rooms have bunkbeds and shared bathrooms. Rooms are clean and air conditioner worked well. Although our the rooms with two queen beds are located across from the elevators, they were not bad noise-wise. Like most New Yorkers, it is easy and cheap to have your laundry picked up and delivered the same day. I would send out about 10-15 pounds of laundry and pay $10-14 USD. The clientele are mostly young professionals/ travelers but there were older couples, a few families, and clientele hailed from all over the globe. Free internet and decent speed.

After reading reviews online, comparing it to a European hostel, the primary reason for booking it was the reasonable cost. Through a booking service, it was literally one of the most reasonable stays in Manhattan (and that is saying something!) After arrival, check-in, and an elevator ride to our floor, we approached the room, entered it, and I almost suffered a panic attack! It looked somewhat like a prison cell - the INCREDIBLY small size of our room was shocking! There was a bunkbed, with nary two-three feet of space to walk alongside. There is no bathroom in the room, just a very small cubby, with a working sink. There is a small closet cubby, with ample room for neatly stacking a suitcase or two, along with coats and shoes. There is a desk and chair at the foot of the bed. There are shared bathrooms on each quad of the floor. Above the door in your room, there are indicator lights, which let you know which bathrooms are vacant and which are currently in use. (These shared bathrooms were initially the source of my greatest concern, but I have to say that they were kept INCREDIBLY clean! And it was also nice that individual packets of necessary toiletries were provided, as needed. The shower units also had wonderful, adjustable spa shower heads and depending on which facility you used, some also had massage jets, adjustable for neck and back - nice touch!) Each bunk was equipped with its' own television, which was attached to an arm that could be extended out for viewing and then pushed back in to place the tele out of reach...quite clever. We had a lovely, old-fashioned barn-door shutter that opened for spectacular views of this extraordinary city. Considering we spent very little time in our room, it ended up working out fine for us, after adjusting to the very confined space. There was a wonderful concierge, who was happy to help with providing pamphlets, city maps, and gave great advice on where to go and the best and most affordable ways to get there. All in all, it was a good pick for us. They do have other room options available...we did not have a chance to view any of those rooms during our stay.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",17,4.0

Now When I first got to that 230 I noticed the smell, the smell of a serious damp problem in that room, I didn't see any but it just smelled of damp and the smell stung my eyes but then things got worse when I couldn't touch the light switch; the light switch was extremely sticky! There was something like glue on the light switch or something all I knew was that I had to use a tissue to use the light switch and that tissue got stuck, which is disgusting. So I asked for a second room and I got given the room 812, a much, much better room I was so happy the only downside to it was the over powering smell of cheap air freshener.  My favourite feature of this whole hotel was the roof top. Every morning I would get breakfast from one of the cafes close by then take it up to the roof top and eat breakfast, the view was spectacular and it was great to it breakfast there. There was a garden but nobody really used it because there was literally nothing in there, but the cafe was good even though they only sold breakfast food and stopped selling hot food at 11:30am after that time it was only snacks that they sold.  The location was good, a good 10 minute walk to Times Square, 15 minute walk to Empire State Building and 20 minute walk to Central Park. But if you don't want to walk that far there is a lot of subway stations close by the hotel to take you around. I personally I chose to walk everywhere and it was a great walk to everything; even walked the hour and 30 minute walk to the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.  Another down side to the hotel was check out time. I got confirmation I would check out at 6pm, as I had chosen a late check out but when I went to the front desk and asked them about this they said ""Check out is at noon, if you want to check out at 6pm you'll have to pay for an extra nights stay"" which I found absolutely ridiculous considering I wasn't going to use that extra night if I had paid for it. Only good thing was being able to leave your luggage in storage while you go out for the day and come back for it later.  I highly, highly recommend the walking tours, especially the tour on Wednesday! The walking tours are free, you just speak to those at the concierge desk and they set you up then you meet at the scheduled time. I found there really wasn't much choice in the walking tours but the Wednesday one took everybody around Grand Central Station where they let us buy some New Yorker snacks like Black & White cakes, New Yorker Cheese cakes and took us around the Rockefeller center telling us little facts we wouldn't have known before. They were so informative and after the tour gave us precise directions back to the hotel.

The air conditioning was a little on the noisy side but I still slept well. The cafe is well priced and I had breakfast there 4 or 5 times. Reasonable selection of food and drinks available. Coffee, bagel and granola with yogurt is about $11. I would highly recommend staying here as it's very handy for seeing the sights especially as there's the stop for the 4/5/6 a block away and only two blocks away on 53rd street is the E which takes you down to the World Trade via Penn Station or you can use it to get from JFK once you're off the AirTrain.

My first time I managed to find a good deal for an ensuite and the room was perfect for my needs. It was a decent size for New York (although still on the smaller side), and the room was very clean and comfortable. A/C was amazing, and unlike some other hotels, you can keep it on during the day so you can come back to a lovely cool room. Being a solo traveller, I had no issues with the ensuite bathroom although some couples may find it a bit awkward as the shower section was just transparent glass, with a frosted sliding door to close off the toilet area (my door kept sliding back).I checked back into the hotel a few days later and stayed in a room with communal bathroom facilities down the hall. Room was smaller but still adequate for what I needed, and the bathrooms were always clean.Wifi worked perfectly during my entire stay, and being able to leave your luggage after check out was very helpful for people like me with late night flights. Also the location of the hotel is perfect as it's walking distance to many tourist sites and there are two subway stations that are a 5 minute walk away. As a female solo traveller, I felt safe walking back late at night as all the streets were brightly lit. There is also a yummy bagel place nearby (Ess-a-bagel), a cheap diner that was great for breakfasts and also a bakery with the most amazing cupcakes and puddings. Tip: my first day I spent 20 minutes trying to find a grocery shop to buy bottled water and snacks but there is a large pharmacy called Duane Reade nearby that sells almost everything you'd need.Would definitely recommend this place, and I will be staying here again during my next trip.

You really can't get any better for the price in this neighborhood - while it the Waldorf Astoria it ain't, it fulfills everything it needs to be for the no nonsense traveler who wants to spend more time exploring all that NYC has to offer versus holing themselves up in a hotel room.The desk staff were very nice and helpful, and having luggage check was superb as I literally got in, dropped my bag, and ran to get to the Yankees game. The elevators a wee bit tiny, especially when it comes to fitting multiple people and luggage, but it's Manhattan, so what do you expect...I was always able to find a spot to get in and get to my floor. The 14th floor rooftop terrace was awesome. You're situated right in between so many beautiful buildings, so the view may seem blocked to some, but I really enjoyed the feeling. They have it laid out really nicely with reclined chairs and a table, so I would definitely check it out as a place to unwind after a long day out and about. The rooms are small, like barely a dorm room small, but that's what they're supposed to be. Mine looked a little well worn with some scuffs on the wall, but it was very clean, and it mini-sink was stocked and also very clean. Honestly, the pillow provided was 110x better than any of the pillows I've had at any of my recent, large name hotel stays. Loved the flat screen TV! Air conditioning works GREAT, so bring a jacket if you get cold at night. The shared bathroom thing felt a little weird to me when I originally booked, but it's totally doable. There's a light up display above your door that let you know which bathrooms are occupied, and they are decently clean. The only downside is that they don't furnish paper towels, which honestly is kind of stupid. I get that we're supposed to bring our hand towels with us, but that seems fairly unsanitary, and doesn't make sense when you've been out all day and want to make a beeline to the bathroom without having to stop at your room first (especially when you already need to wash your hands!). Everyone ends up trying to use the bathroom tissue to dry their hands, which shreds and then gets on the floor. I think you'd save more money in the long run, as well as keep things cleaner, if you shelled out for some paper towels! The only other downside is that they don't furnish any kind of water like a lot of chain hotels do now. It would be nice to put those water cooler-esque water jugs on the floors so that people could refill their water bottles after long days walking around the city.Overall, this is not a place I would bring a large family to or stay for a fancy, romantic vacation, as it is pretty much the bare bones of traveling. However, for similar solo trips or trips with a few friends, I would absolutely book again because the location is great, and it was very fairly priced for NYC. You're literally a less than 15 minute walk from Grand Central, and are in a cool neighborhood with a lot to offer right on the surrounding blocks. You can easily get to any of the main tourist spots via a less than 30 minute subway ride, or there are a bunch of Ubers/cabs always nearby. I felt very safe staying here as a solo female traveler, and am glad I took the plunge and tried it out!Thanks for a great time, Pod 51!","Atlanta, Georgia",28,4.0

I went to their website to see what that entailed and it said TWO full sized beds. When my girlfriends and I arrived to our room and it was the size of a bathroom and had ONE twin sized bed! When I complained to the manger and showed him receipts of my payment AND the picture that THEIR website showed for the room. He still proceeded to tell me that because I made the order through a third party website (working advantage..perks from my job) that I was not guaranteed that kind of room. This does not make sense for many reasons: 1. There was no disclaimer for this on any of their sites or even my email confirmation. 2. If your website shows two beds for that type of room am I wrong to assume that is what I will be getting? So after talking to him some more he finally gave us a room with two beds (although not full) AND a balcony which was nice. Another issue I had with my stay at this hotel was the fact that I had a random man come knocking on my door at 5am claiming that I had his belongings, as I told this man that he had the wrong room and would be calling the police soon, he proceeded to go downstairs to the front desk and call security. Security came back to our room with this very crazed and angry man insisting that we should all come out of the room. As three young females in NY fro the first time, none of us felt comfortable or safe showing our faces to this clearly violent and abrasive man accusing us of having his belongings. We obviously refused and sought safety in our room. It baffled me that the security guard would want us to show our faces to this man who., for all we know, did not even stay in this hotel! As security his first priority should have been the safety of the CURRENT hotel occupants. For the rest of the night we stayed up waiting for police to come...they never did. The next morning, we went to the front desk to complain. I was shocked that no one from management had come to check on us to make sure we were alright. With our luck, we saw the same gentleman in reception STILL claiming we had his belongings. After speaking to the manger for the second time in 24 hours, he found the REAL culprits. The crazed man tried to apologize but we were all to shocked and disgusted by the situation to even care for one. Another thing, you would think that after an ordeal like this and paying nearly $500 for two nights (granted it was labor day weekend), that we would be compensated in some way by the manger....NOPE! All we received was a 'sorry'. No discount off, No free breakfast, NOTHING! Another thing to add, this hotel does not have an ice machine or a water fountain to make sure to bring bottles with you. We were so displeased with our experience with this hotel that we did not even try to go to the rooftop (a big attraction for the hotel). We just wanted to leave ASAP! All in all, make sure you are very safe and call and confirm everything with this establishment before you actually go. The hotel itself is not bad, it is funky and centrally located in Manhattan near a lot of restaurants, convenient stores and the subway. ","Boston, Massachusetts",4,2.0

I stayed for 9 nights, for work, and opted for a private bathroom. The prices of both Pods have gone up considerably since their opening; there are better deals available for more spacious rooms, equally well-located. I think if you don't mind a shared bathroom the Pods are still a good deal. The airco is very loud. Toiletries are not that good, and no shower cap provided. I was unable to reach the reception with the telephone in my room. Toilet space extremely cramped, one has to sit sideways. I gave the doorman quite a tip, but he did not help me with carrying my bags to the curb. Desk in room is not really to work from, and the alternative offered in the ""lounge space"" is also not working since there are noisy people the whole time yelling in their phones (perhaps because they are in a shared room?).

There were bunk rooms and shared bathrooms on our floor, and we had to pay a high price for a private double room with ensuite. Maybe this is New York prices, but it was expensive for what seemed like a pimped-up youth hostel. Having said that, they tried hard to make the communal feel of a hostel work well, with a nice bar with a small selection of essential food items, a nice outdoor courtyard and absolutely excellent rooftop area, with amazing views across the city and comfy loungers scattered around. They had no problem with your bringing in your own food and setting up a nice little feast on the rooftop. Lovely. The room was described as small, so yep, it surely was very small. Barely larger than the bed, but comfy and lots of (openable!) windows, so it didn't really feel that cramped. The bathroom reminded me of those moulded fibreglass cubicles you have on overnight trains - squeeze in and don't breathe out or you'll get jammed in there. We're both skinny and it was a struggle to sit on the loo without crashing your knees. They had installed a light in the shower cubicle so it didn't feel so tiny and dark, luckily, otherwise you'd never find the soap. But the location was great, and we can highly recommend getting your breakfast across the road in the most beautiful 'wild' garden in NYC - and the city's best kept secret. The simple cafe food and good coffee can be enjoyed in front of a spectacular waterfall in serene garden - no cost, no hassle, no stress and a cool haven from the heat and crowds just a few metres outside. I can't remember what this miraculous garden was called but if you get a chance its on 51st street almost directly in front of the Pod 51 hotel.","Warsaw, Poland",41,4.0

My room, a single with private bathroom, was comically small, but it had everything I needed: twin bed, desk and chair, closet nook, safe (a small safe sufficient for an iPad and wallet), sink and mirror, shower and toilet. The whole set up was efficient, modern, and clean. Pod 51 is also not very far from Grand Central Station and is right near Ess-a-Bagel. The hotel also had bagels from the shop available in the lobby lounge, as well as beer, wine, and snacks. And, it had a unique personality. For example, in the lobby were flat-screen TVs with photographs of graffiti flashing on them. So, it was a little hipster, but the guests ranged from teenagers to grandparents. I do have two small complaints. I felt there was too much light in the room at night and, with my head right near the AC, the noise from the AC disturbed my sleep. I also stayed there on two very hot nights, so the AC was working overtime.Overall, I would totally recommend Pod 51 to anyone wanting efficient lodgings for a few days in the city.

Our keys didn't work on the room we were given, so they easily switched us to another one which was fine. The walls are extremely thin, we heard lots of ""adult play"" at all hours of the day and night. The sign on the back of each room door encourages it, ironically! The rooms are small but we expected it, and were very happy with the space we had and the room organization (drawers, hangers, shelves etc). We had a bathroom in our room. Note on the bathroom in your room, there is a sliding frosted door and it will either cover the shower or the toilet, but not both. So be comfortable with the person your staying with!! We used the hallway bathrooms for #2 because that worked better for us. If you use your toilet you will want to slide the bathroom door shut, but then as soon as you step into the shower you want to open the bathroom door so it slides to cover the shower...its interesting but didn't bother us. The room was serviced every day. The cafe down in the lobby is great for breakfast! but is open all day for snacks and food. We really utilized the rooftop deck, brought up our own food and drinks and relaxed. There are 2 day beds, and about 10 relaxing chairs, as well as another 8-10 around a large table. The deck was the most memorable perk to us! The location is great, only a 3-5 minute walk to the subway, and about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square. I highly recommend the pubs on 2nd Ave (right around the corner from the hotel, less than 2 minutes walk) The food is wayy more reasonably priced than anywhere else in NYC.

In the room there was a small desk and chair, a rack to hang your clothes up, a little sink with an area to put toiletries, a hook by the sink which was perfect for your towel, towels and a hairdryer, coat hooks then the bunk beds which both had plug sockets with a little shelf and their own telly. The beds were very comfortable and all bedding was clean. The air con was ok but a little loud. We had 2 bathrooms on our floor and lights in the room indicated if they were available or not.

Room was perfectly functional and comfortable. Spacious is not the word I'd use to describe Pod but I suppose that's the whole concept. Bed was comfy and the additional pillows were great for sitting in the bed to watch the TV. The clever storage and shelving made it easy to plonk everything down after a long tiring day and made the whole place feel very homely. The bathroom and shower facilities were lovely and felt quite luxurious to a poor student like me. The whole hotel has a very loud colourful modern theme which was totally not to my taste but I'm sure some people would enjoy it. The best part of this hotel was the rooftop terrace. The view of the city was fantastic - especially at night. There wasn't too much noise at night but when I was working during the day I found the AC unit was far too loud and disrupted my phonecalls. The little cafe downstairs seems very basic but it's actually perfectly sized for this hotel and the garden space was nice too. The coffee was lovely - proper coffee, not American brownwater - and I highly recommend the cinnamon rolls! The area is nice too and feels quite safe. Lots of gorgeous restaurants nearby but they're all very pricey! Had to head into central NYC for a more affordable dinner on the second night.

The safe is pretty useless unless you have tall, narrow objects. The bathroom is tiny, but if that is a problem for you, the shared bathrooms are much larger, but they are shared (natch). It's a lot like staying on a cruise ship in the extreme functionality of the room. I had a corner room, so there were windows on both sides. Really nice to have the sunlight and the breeze. I kept the windows open at night, since the air conditioner was a little loud.I stayed there for a week and plan on staying there again. The hotel is quiet and on a quiet part of 51st street. There are a number of nice, neighborhood restaurants close by and the cafe in the hotel serves a simple, tasty breakfast and snacks all day long. There is a garden on the first floor for lounging and a rooftop garden. The hotel has no parking, but they will give you a discount at the Icon parking garage about a block away.

From the moment we arrived everything was great! Someone took our bags to our rooms whilst we checked in, check again was easy and only took a minute. Our room was clean and tidy as was the bathroom. Our room was cleaned daily and the bed made. We had a great air con system in our room which was welcomed after miles of walking. We went up to the roof top patio i guess you would call it twice, there's no signs for it but if you go up to the 14 floor and turn right out of the lift then walk to the end of the hall there is a door on the left which take you up to the roof. It's great for sunbathing and has great views! We had clean towels everyday and a hairdryer in the room (a reasonably good one too). We were located on the 4th floor facing the front (street) we had little to no noise as the neighbourhood is quiet but you do hear the occasional horn from a car but that is everywhere in NYC. The rooms aren't huge but they are practical but I’m not fussed on size as I’m only there to sleep as i spend the days/evenings out exploring the city. Location was great, everything is about a 15 minute walk away (times square, grand central, central park etc) there is also a subway station 1 block away. There are great little places to eat located all around the hotel so you're spoilt for choice. You can also order food from the hotel which we did on occasion which was good and reasonably priced for NYC. another thing to mention is the rooms come with a safe and you get free wifi during your stay. there is also a good space in the room to hang clothes with hangers provided.We were there for 7 nights and i would definitely re book to stay here for my next visit to NYC.","Bristol, United Kingdom",6,5.0

Located on east 51st St. near 3rd Avenue, it is within a block or two of two subway stations and within walking distance of St. Patrick's Cathedral, MOMA, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station, the New York Public Library, and the Morgan Library. A French bistro is just next door, a Thai restaurant two doors up, and a 24-hour Duane Reade drug store just a block or so away. Of course, this is an ""economy"" hotel, so I expected the minimum of service and was startled when, just after my airport shuttle dropped me off, a bellman suddenly came rushing out the hotel's front door, greeted me, and assisted me with my luggage.This hotel is priced for the budget-minded traveler, but nothing about it is ""cheap"" or ""low rent."" The clean, spacious lobby features a nice mural about New York life, and just off the lobby is a nice lounge where guests gather for breakfast, chat, or checking e-mail or the internet on one of three terminals built into the wall (I was able to use one of them to check into my return flight and print my boarding pass to the printer behind the front desk). Just outside the lobby is a garden balcony for enjoying one's coffee in the cool morning air. And the roof, 14 floors up, features a very spacious deck with plenty of chairs and a nice Midtown NY view. I was in New York to meet friends and had breakfast elsewhere, but prices on the a la carte breakfast menu (posted in the elevators) seemed reasonable, and alcoholic beverages were also available for purchase. WiFi is free and works well.The staff are all professional, courteous, and accommodating. Although no one announced this, I'm pretty sure they have a plainclothes security officer in the lobby each shift, from the way the men I saw looked and carried themselves, and of course, this adds to the feeling of security, even though the hotel seems to be in a nice neighborhood anyway. Complimentary copies of USA Today are available at the front desk, and a soda machine is nearby. Walking tours are available for guests two or three days a week, and guests can even seen up to be in the audience on the Larry Wilmore show.Room prices are a great bargain for Manhattan. The room was one of the smallest I've ever been in, but everything was so efficiently and elegantly arranged that I never felt cramped or closed in. I suppose there must be rooms large enough for couples, but I stayed in a single. The room included a sink and mirror, a recessed ""closet"" space that even included a built-in safe, a bath towel, hand towel (but strangely, no washrag), a blow dryer, plastic drinking tumblers, two bars of soap, small vials of body lotion and conditioner, a wall-mounted flat screen TV, a single chair, a spacious counter-type desk, an in-room phone, a clock radio, a wall-mounted reading lamp, a bedside table, several conveniently placed electrical outlets for recharging your phone, and an extra pillow on a shelf in the closet. ""Clean, comfortable, cozy, and convenient"" were the words that came to mind. Rooms are available with in-room toilets and showers for a higher rate, but I stayed in one with a shared bath for the sake of a lower price. I haven't shared a bath in years, and it was my only misgiving, because I thought that two rooms had a bath between them and that I might end up locked out because the tenant of the other room forgot and left the door to my side locked from within. In fact, there was no need for anxiety. Each floor has two adjacent rooms marked ""W.C.,"" with a clear indicator on the door as to whether it is vacant or occupied. Your room key also opens the bathroom. Each bathroom has a toilet, sink, and shower stall with plenty of hot water and wall-mounted dispensers of soap and shampoo. Over a 3-night-stay involving 3 morning showers and one in late afternoon, as I prepared for an evening out, as well as one nocturnal visit each night to use the toilet, I never saw either bathroom occupied at all or had to wait for one to open. One or two guests were a little inconsiderate and left their wet towel mats lying next to the shower instead of taking them back to their rooms, but overall, the bathrooms were clean and neat.The bed was only just big enough for one person, of course, but quite comfortable, as were the pillows. The air-conditioning kept the room cool and pleasant. Interestingly, though I would hear music and conversation coming from other rooms as I passed them on the way to mine, once inside my own room, I heard nothing at all from outside, though part of this may have been because I had a corner room. The window shutters kept out the outside light sufficiently to let me sleep.I have only four complaints:1. No washrag with your bath linens. I haven't bathed or showered without a washrag in 35 years.2. Although I got maid service, on my second day there, no hand towel was left with clean bath linens, and I had to stop a hotel staff member in the hall and ask for one.3. On one of my mornings there, I called the front desk around 6:15 (in other words, when it was not busy), and it rang ten times, and no one answered.4. The elevators are sometimes so slow that you wonder if the call buttons aren't working.Overall, though, I highly recommend this place. The location can't be beat, and if you are traveling alone and watching your budget but still want a place that is clean, well-run, and with some reasonable (and even unexpected) amenities, the Pod 51 is worth a serious look.","Fort Worth, Texas",113,5.0

We stayed from May 22-25 and were looking for a relatively inexpensive way to stay at a nice hotel in Manhattan. Pod 51 fit the bill perfectly. The room, though tiny, had everything we needed - the bunk beds had individual TVs and little nooks in the wall to charge our phones. There was an indicator over the door that lit up to show which bathrooms were occupied. Having the bathrooms out in the hall was not an issue - not once did I encounter another person while on the way to the bathroom, and not once during our visit were more than 2 bathrooms occupied at once. The showers were fantastic and spacious, with rain showers and temperature adjustment by degrees. The location is also excellent; a block and a half from the subway.

This is a nice, simple, easy on the wallet hotel. Clean. Polite staff. So, I forgot my cell phone in VA, so I wasn't able to take any pictures to go with the review. The room I stayed in was the most affordable type, bunk bed suite, I had the room to myself. You don't share the rooms with anyone. The room is small, equivalent to a dormitory single in college. Small desk, sink inside the room, plenty of towels, pillows, tissue, hand soap, lotion inside the room, hangers, and a luggage rack. The bathrooms are shared, outside of the actual room. They have these little lights inside of the room that notifies you which restroom is occupied. The bathrooms are clean. Equivalent to a gym - a clean gym. So, you take your towel and shower stuff, use your key card to enter the bathroom and lock up. The shower is inside, and the water falls down like an overhead waterfall. Kinda cool actually. They have shampoo and shower gel inside, but I always bring my own. I recommend shower shoes or flip flops and a bathrobe - or you will have to dry and get dressed *inside* the bathroom which is sort of narrow. It gets humid and muggy so getting dressed inside was annoying. Next time, I will bring a long bathrobe. I considered sneaking out in my towel and running to my room, but I figured that may not be following polite etiquette. So, I sucked it up and got dressed in the friggin sweltering, humid bathroom. The lobby area has a nice little patio off to the side, tables and benches to sit on. They have a mini-snack bar that sells coffee, snacks, bagels, breakfast food, beer, wine, etc. There is a rooftop deck that you can hang out on which closes up at 10 pm - or slightly afterwards. The rooftop is cool, has nice lounging chairs you can just sit back in and take in the night time view of the city. I forget the hours of operation. I took my meal I had purchased nearby and ate it up there. I noticed they offer free walking tours and the opportunity to sit in on the Comedy Central studio audience on Wednesday night. Bummed I was checking out so I couldn't attend.I saw families, people traveling alone, business people, couples, and people from all over, different languages floating in the air.Decor is modern, colorful, and I would add...sleek and upbeat. I made reservations for the bunk bed room and said to myself, if its too small, I would bump it up a notch. It was fine.Not noisy at all - but I was here on a weeknight, not the weekend. Beds are comfortable. If you're into paying $300 + per night at a fancy schmancy hotel - just to sleep...then go right ahead. I paid $158 total, including tax and slept like a baby! I will definitely return. Maybe I will try the other pod hotel the next time. This place is awesome.",,4,4.0

Check in was quick and hassle free and all staff were helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 9th floor and it was spotless. We knew it would be small and this didn't worry us as it was just a base for our busy week. There was only a couple of niggles for me, one was that it did not have a view of the city as this would have been nice and the other was the lack of any privacy with regards to the loo & shower. (Frosted glass on the shower would be better). That said, it was a very nice room with an extremely comfortable bed, a desk with phone and i-pod charger/clock, hairdryer, air conditioner and a lovely rain style shower. The maid service was fabulous and we left a little tip each day (she didn't take it on the first day as we just left it on the desk so on the other days we left it with a note saying 'thank you'. Proves the honesty of staff.There is a wonderful roof terrace with modern loungers and big beds to relax on. A little shade would have been appreciated as it was really hot and sunny and I did get burnt, but it was a great spot to relax, surrounded by skyscrapers & listening to the sounds of the city. There is also a small garden/courtyard area at the back of the hotel which also has a lovely atmosphere. If you fancy an early morning bagel, there is a fantastic bagel shop just round the corner called Ess-a-Bagel, which I cannot rate highly enough. Try the PB&J, it's amazing. Pod 51 is perfectly situated close enough to be able to walk to Times Square, Central Park, Empire State Building, Rockefellar Center and all the shopping in the city, but it's also far enough away from all the noise to feel less hectic and quite relaxed.

First, the size of the bunk pod (@ Pod 51, twin bunks) that I had was dorm room size. My guess is around 100 square feet. But the designers put a lot of thought into what you need in a hotel room: Desk, chair, hooks, individual TVs, individual lights, safe, etc. No refrigerator. A small window. The mattress is just OK. Enough space to open your suitcase. You are back in your dorm room, only NYC is right outside. So the room size and its design are OK. Second, the shared bathrooms for the least expensive rooms are just OK. They are clean, but the shower head is difficult if you are 6' 2'' or taller, the toilet is difficult if you are obese, and another clothing hook would be useful. The doors lock for privacy.Bathroom indicator lights for the shared bathrooms (on your floor) are on your room's wall. (I think the Pod 39 location only has small private bathrooms). Towels are in your room. Your room has a small metal wash basin with running water. So the shared bathrooms are acceptable.Some overall comments: the communal spaces are good and well designed; the area around Pod 51 is pretty good. Times Square is about a 15 minute walk. So the location is good. The hallways are dark. I did not get to go to the hotel rooftop because a fire broke out next door (May 16, 2016) and the hotel was evacuated by NYFD for about 2 hours, and still smelled like smoke for the rest of the night. The concierge can call a car for you to go to LGA airport for $40.Finally, the price is right.

The hotel had a fantastic bar upstairs with a great view and friendly atmosphere, with most of us all there for similar reasons. Location wise, you are in good walking distance, if you like walking, from rockafeller centre, empire state, 5th avenue, public library and even Central Park if you enjoy a good walk. On my previous visit I had a shared bathroom, which I would probably do again on my next trip based on that the en suites have frosted glass doors, which leave very little to the imagination and made worse in our room that the bed faced the bathroom. On this occasion I was travelling with a friend but even as a couple I think I would find this uncomfortable.

It would be somewhere between the rooftop 'lounge' and the shower. I think I am going to go with the shower, because I used it every day, and it was heavenly. I had an incident with one of the desk staff, which did sour the experience a bit, but I am not going to judge the Pod on that. It is a bit annoying that the hotel manager is only available during office hours (I left the hotel at about 08:15 and returned around 18:00), as I would like to have taken it up with him/her. Each time I asked for a manager I was told he/she was not in yet or had left already.The lady sitting at the side desk (I forget what she is called) who tells you where to go and advises you on shows etc..

With a small desk and wireless LAN, I was able to work without problems. I'm quite a big guy but didn't have any problems using toilet or shower and the mattress and pillows were really fine, I slept very well!

The location was just ideal, it was maybe a 20 minute walk across to Times Square and it's only afew minutes walk to the 6 and E Metro lines which pretty much took me everywhere I needed to go!The surrounding Neighbourhood of Turtle Bay was cool with good pubs and restaurants and there are two 24/7 Duane Reads/Walgreens really nearby which is really convenient. There are also a few laundry's within walking distance if you're travelling for an extended period as I was. I had a single room with shared bathroom and it was actually a more spacious room than I had expected based on the pictures and the previous reviews I had read. For me on my own there was ample room! There was a sink and hairdryer in the room as well as storage space with hangers. The window ledges behind the shutters proved very useful for keeping a bottle of wine cold too as there was no fridge in the room. The shared bathroom was always perfectly clean and there were 4 on each floor so I never found myself waiting for access. They also have this cool light panel in your room which showed you whether any of the bathrooms were occupied, so you didn't walk down their in your PJ's only to stand and wait in the corridor! My only slight criticism was that I felt the reception and concierge staff probably could have been a little more friendly and welcoming but to be honest, I had such little interaction with them that this didn't impact my stay in any way.In comparison to prices of hotels in Manhattan this was such great value for money and I would definitely stay here again on return to New York.","London, United Kingdom",8,4.0

I found a great deal on Booking.com for Pod 51 and jumped on it. When you come to Pod 51, you have to be willing to commit to the concept of the hotel, which is very tiny rooms (although I was surprised at how well used the space was) and shared bathrooms, unless you splurge on the rooms with an en suite.I had zero problems with using the bathrooms down the hall -- there is a light system above the doorway that tells you which bathrooms are free, and each bathroom has a shower and toilet as a separate unit, so it isn't dorm style with shower stalls next to one another. Walking down the hall was an easy accommodation to make for the great price.The room itself was clean and neat, offering all of the amenities of a regular hotel room, just with a smaller square footage. No complaints there. And despite the fact that everyone was walking down the hall to use the bathroom, I don't remember footsteps outside my room keeping me awake at night.Lastly, the area is solid, close to a few different subway lines and very walkable.

You are steps to the subway and/or buses and have awesome restaurants surrounding you. Walk to Times Square if you must, it's easy to do. It's really incredible that they can offer such inexpensive accommodations in such a fabulous neighborhood. But of course there's a price to pay if you want this neighborhood for this price, and it's minimalist living-- bunk beds for some, shared bathrooms for many, and paper-thin doors for everybody. BRING FROM HOME: earplugs for sleeping and flip flops or shower slippers if you have a shared bathroom because EW, you never know what's on the bathroom floor when you're sharing it with forty people.BRING FROM ROOM: a hand towel from your room if you share a bathroom you will be using your jeans to wipe off otherwise.Now, the longer form:Pod51 is a mostly-successful attempt at cooperative, short-term living. The vibe is slick and modern with clean lines and uncluttered spaces. It is clean and well-managed. The common area has large, shared work tables, free WiFi, communal iPads and a small commissary/bar. Free walking tours are available three days a week--each targeting different ""hip"" areas of NYC. It's nicely thought-out and the standards are higher than you would find even your typical name brand hotel (sorry, Hilton). All for an incredibly low price. The upsides are that the location is OUTSTANDING and the building is fresh and contemporary. Rooms are tiny but serviceable. The rooms that do not have bathrooms come with a small sink area which makes sharing a bathroom with forty of your closest neighbors survivable. Outside noise was at a minimum for NYC, which was a welcome surprise. Front desk staff are friendly and helpful and check-in was a breeze. We did not avail ourselves of concierge services, but the desk is adjacent to the front desk and was staffed at most reasonable hours to help you with any information or resources you might need. After you check out, the ""doorman"" will cheerfully store your luggage as you continue on your New York Adventure to maximize your stay.We loved 90% of Pod 51. But we also spent most of our night listening to the 24/7 bumpin' radio in the room next door. For some reason, the doors of Pod 51 allow an incredible amount of noise to penetrate any given room. I could speculate why but it's not important: what's important is that you prepare yourself with earplugs in advance.Besides that, you'll have a blast staying at the Pod 51. Which my kids read the sign as Poo 51 (thanks to an ambiguous ""futuristic"" font) and that's how it will forever be known by our little family, on our no doubt regular returns.","Evanston, Illinois",35,4.0

How stupid of me to believe that anything in this price range ($150) would be nice in NYC. We requested a Q bed w/ ensuite bathroom. Well, the first room we were put in had the bathroom with a door that did not shut and was about 2 feet from the bed. As in, one could literally sit on the toilet and almost touch the bed. In addition the tv didn't work properly so we requested a new room the next day. Management was very happy to oblige because there just happened to be a nicer room available. We moved our belongings to the new room immediately without having to wait and went out for the day. The room was nice but it the design is quite comical. At least the bathroom door shut.When one is laying in the bed, there is a huge window that looks right into the shower (no privacy at all. IF the door happens to be open then there is a good sized window looking into the bathroom.. one person on the commode and one peaking in.. what fun. It is ok for partners sharing a room but a bit awkward for 2 singles etc.The second night we realized how very thin the walls must be as our 'neighbors' returned at approx 2am and laughed loudly almost the whole night... and hey, we were in NYC so of course they got take out at 3am. The walls must be paper thin. You can hear everything!! Well, you get what you pay for.

We paid in total 1147 pound for direct flights and 4 nights on Expedia. We found this to be the cheapest rate at the time and this hotel is a cut above the rest you'll find for that price. The location is fantasic, about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square and Applebee's (of which we had pancakes and coffee every morning) it's about 8 mins walk from the Rockefeller centre. We found taking the subway line 4&5 (I believe it was) for 2 dollars to get to lower Manhattan was a no brainer. Bit scary on the subway but worth it lol otherwise if only going 5-6 blocks take a taxi for 6-8 dollars plus a tip. The hotel was clean, modern and basic. YES the room is small as people keep complaining, but who flyes 3000 miles purely for the hotel room? All that matters is it's clean comfortable and a good base to get your head down, with polite friendly staff. If you want space for this price go stay in a flea bitten shack that hasn't been cleaned In a week or get real. Only buy from the hotel bar at happy hour unless your rich. There's always someone sat by the hotel reception who will give you advice and directions for a small tip, we recommend keeping the map they give you, it was a life saver. The restaurant was under refurb when we visited so can't comment however this was good as it forced us to get out and explore for food. We had shared bathrooms which is no trouble at all and I'd do it again, you have about 3-4 per floor and they are clean and have a good jet on them, you rarely bump into anyone and they are so close it's really not worth paying more to have your own. Plus bare in mind we are quite conservative in nature and were concerned at first but it's really no big deal.Couple of recommendations for you if interested:For a good authentic candle lit Italian with fantasic service and food try Osteria Lounge on 209 East 42nd street.For a more upmarket restaurant serving amazing food try Hillstone on 153 East 53rd street, this is the best restaurant Ive been to, the atmosphere and style is like you see in a movie. I had the campfire ribs. Best ribs I have ever eaten without doubt. Same prices as every other restaurant which was surprising. Make sure you wear a shirt and smart shoes or you'll feel out of place.For a proper greasy American diner check out Genes diner, 26E 60th street. We asked a bellboy where he recommends. The service was great, food was good and a great experience, close to Central park.Be sure to get some honey roasted almonds from one of the food stands, watch out for the guys on them, they can be a bit hostile and money hungry. Plus if anyone tries to give you a free CD saying they are a performer, just ignore them. Being a friendly person and from England I said okay then when i didn't want to give him the exact tip he asked for he just turned from nice to nasty. I get the tip culture but saying it's free but you have to give me 5 dollars for it means Im buying it for 5 dollars. Plus when I said I have no small notes he pulled out a wad of cash and said its okay I have change. Get lost pal. So yeah just ignore them.Biggest con is tipping everyone, it ends up costing you a lot more than you bargained for. But this is their culture and I am a big believer in embracing people's culture if you're a visitor. However what's annoying is when people think they can choose their tip, 95% of the service was fantasic and youll take pleasure in giving them a nice tip. However when the service is lousy and they still expect a tip and write what they want on the receipt, that I don't agree with. But this is rare and happened about twice amongst dozens of restaurant visits.Sorry to go on. But I'd 100% recommend this hotel and I'd stay here again and id also like to say thank you to all the friendly New Yorkers who actually made it a much more pleasant, friendly and awkward free place to be compared to England!

The story made international news and was quite distressing for all those involved. I instantly notified the hotel from the plane saying we'd be a day late. Upon arrival and a call to booking.com, the hotel flat out refused to have any compassion and shift our stay by one day, charging us for a night we weren't there. As a consequence we had to pay another $102 for another nights stay (as Virgin were kind enough to move our return trip ahead by one day to compensate) since then the hotel have still refused to show any understanding or reimburse us. The maids were also incredibly rude and do their cleaning from as early as 6.30am, causing much disruption through the thin walls and even knocking on the door at this time to see if we were in. The location is fantastic and there's a little table alongside the reception where there are two people who are very helpful and friendly in helping you to find your bearings. The bathroom door in our room didn't even close and had a window??? So it took very little effort for my partner and I to watch each other do our business, which is pleasant in any hotel. Normal amenities of a room like a fridge or kettle aren't included so expect to eat out all the time unless you want their $4 croissant.

The location is perfect- very close to the subway but only a short walk to 5th avenue and Times Square. The let down for us however was the staff. We found the reception and concierge staff to be rude and uninterested in helping guests. The bell boys however were very nice and helpful. We unfortunately both became extremely sick while staying here and called a doctor. The doctor came and arranged for some medication to be brought to us at the hotel. On arrival the pharmacist asked the front desk to call the room to let us know he was here and when she called she said ""I guess you have ordered medication""... It might just be a petty observation in my part but I find that comment a little inappropriate. We also went to the reception desk at 5:30am and asked if there was anywhere in the hotel we could get bottled water (due to our illness) and she just responded with ""no"" and went back to her work. I guess we just felt the staff to be extremely unenthusiastic compared to the other hotels we stayed at this holiday and we felt like we were bothering them if we asked them anything. For the younger crowd that this hotel attracts, I would think the staff would be a bit more vibrant. Unfortunately we just became too sick and had to cut our trip short. The lady on check out was surprisingly lovely and didn't charge us for the 3 nights we did not stay which we were more than happy to pay. Mixed review for a mixed stay.

The room is small, but what do you expect when the name of the hotel is ""pod"" but for a couple this is not an issue. The bed was comfortable and wide enough and the shower was always hot water and refreshing. We stored our clothes and belongings in the draws under the bed and hanging space so we did not need to live out of our cases despite the lack of space. If you're not spending much time in the hotel, it is the perfect place to stay for an amazing price if you are exploring New York. We had made service everyday which we were very appreciative of. The subway station is a 3 minute walk away, and we purchased a 7 day pass for $31 which we used all the time. At first the subway is confusing but within 4 trips on it we had worked it out and found it absolutely great the rest of the week. I would recommend anyone staying in New York to take the subway everywhere, it's just great, quick and actually quite fun! We purchased a ""New York city pass"" online for our week in New York which was an absolute godsend, It gains you entry to all the top attractions plus discounts at resteraunts and loads more. We worked our we saved $603 by buying the New York pass as entry fees are very pricey everywhere, I can't stress enough how badly everyone should buy the New York City pass! It is a blessing. If you want the worlds best hot chocolate, visit the ""deli 2 cafe"" in Times Square, we went everyday for the amazing hot chocolate and we are having withdrawal symptoms already!

However, the hotel seems to have been designed to attract the upscale hostel crowd (that's a thing?) and plays very hard on trying to be hip, young, and relevant.The decor of the rooms (double with own bathroom) is clean, neat, and small - the idea being that the room is primarily a place to sleep and shower only. This is fine in theory; however, in practice, when all the occupants of the hotel turn out to the relatively small lobby area to work, space can become a premium. For the price, there are other business-style hotels that can suffice.

It was a corner single bed room with two windows. I didn't have any neighbors because the room was on the backside of the restrooms. I did not have any noise issues. The room was clean when I entered. The floor's maid was very kind and hospitable. The bathrooms were cleaned quite often. There was a bathroom around another corner that was bigger than the others with a window seat to place your supplies. I highly recommend that you check out all of your bathroom choices. I did wear flip flops in the showers initially. Once I noticed how often they were cleaned I stopped. I had a turquoise bedspread with atomic-like decorations. It St a great mood for the room. The temperature of the room was fine, I wasn't cold or hot. The TV was a good size. There were plenty of outlets for my electronic devices. The desk was small but I had no issues with space. The price was perfect.I took an earlier flight than previously planned the day I arrived. There was a band playing in Central Park that I wanted to see so I changed my flight plan. I was able to drop off my luggage until a room was available. There was wait staff for the outdoor patio. I ordered an iced chai latte. It had too much milk. The breakfast roll I ordered was fine. I didn't spend very much time at the hotel. I usually got up early, walked all day, then passed out quickly at night. The rooftop is wonderfully calm with a great view.

The location is great, being walking distance to every midtown tourist spot and metres away from the subway for anywhere further afield. The decor is modern and the lounge area is a nice place to regroup. Unfortunately that's where the positives end. On day two of our stay we found a cockroach in the bed so had to change rooms. No apology from anyone about this, or even any kind of surprise which was a little alarming. There was also no attempt to assist us as we changed rooms - just giving us our new key cards and saying to drop off the old keys when our stuff was moved. Our new room (818) was identical save for the fact it appeared to be cockroach free, the safe was broken, the beds headboard was broken and the keycard entry to the door didn't work. So we went down to reception again to ask if these issues could also be sorted. We were given new keys (again) and were assured an engineer would be sent up that day (Tuesday) to fix the safe, however we left on the Sunday and no engineer had ever appeared so the safe remained unusable. This itself was not an insurmountable problem, but why say it was being fixed if you had no intention of doing this?On the Thursday we had some delightful new room neighbours who apparently hadn't realised that the walls were paper thin and decided that 3am was a great time to have a shouting party in their room. Not the hotels fault this time, but oh my lord it was annoying. Clearly the entirety of the floor felt the same way as the front desk came up to tell them to shut up.

The bed was extremely comfortable. The desk was great for organising the day and stashing snacks, ample coat hangers and space for my suit case to sit, heating was amazing (my stay was during Winter Storm Jonas) so much so that I slept with only the sheet most nights. The cafe downstairs serves a modest but delicious breakfast range and I found staff super friendly. Just watch that due to the constraints of being on site, sometimes certain foods aren't ready bang on opening. Concierge is on hand and although I didn't speak with them, noticed that both were very friendly and had no troubles in assisting other travelers. In fact, all staff that I encountered from the front desk to the lovely cleaning ladies were polite and most happy to answer questions/ requests.The kicker is the location!! I could walk almost everywhere. Subway lines are minutes away. One block up is Treehaus Cafe (awesome for breakfast or lunch) basically next door is one of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at (Sukhumvit 51) as well the newly renovated on site restaurant for the Pod.

But the small individual rooms without a bathroom are just too small if you have more than a backpack. If you can get a room with a private bathroom or a large room with or without a private bathroom - then it's worth it. The first room I got smelled like cigarette smoke. The 2nd smelled like sweat. Luckily, I paid a little more for a larger room which was just right. Reception is friendly enough but sharp. Cleaning staff is very friendly and succeeded in keeping rooms clean. However, the hotel is due for an update, it's starting to feel less cool and more sad, like you booked a hostel by mistake.

The Pod Hotel looked like a suitable option and the TripAdvisor reviews were positive so we booked a room. If you’re pushed for time I’ll say right now that this review will also be positive so feel free to move on to the booking form.Where you stay in New York depends very much on what you want to see. For example if your focus is Greenwich Village, the various ‘Towns’ and Staten Island then you might want to book a hotel below 45th street. We had already seen those places during previous visits and had a more general itinerary this time so we stayed at the Pod 51 which is on East 51st Street. This is near to a Subway station and within a reasonable walk of the various Avenues so fine for what we wanted.In anticipation of some shopping, and as we had booked to return on the QM2 - highly recommended by the way - we had three suitcases, one of which was lightly loaded when we arrived but much heavier when we left! Add to this the idea that the Pod is aptly named and you can imagine that our double room was somewhat crowded, we had to be inventive with how we placed our suitcases around the room. Now I must emphasise that this is not a criticism of the Pod Hotel but simply an observation.The hotel was well signed, the interior clean, the staff friendly, the spaces bright and cheerful, the rooms clean and well appointed. We did not eat at the Pod so I cannot comment on the food but there always seemed to be people happily munching in their food area - more like a café than a restaurant - so I assume all was well. We had paid up front but the advertised price was within expectations and certainly good value for money.Not much else to say other than we would stay there again, maybe with one less suitcase, and have already recommended the Pod to friends and family.","Thatcham, United Kingdom",26,4.0

Loved the food window in the lobby, especially since the hotel restaurant next door was closed for renovations. Washrooms were great. Very cool feature: a row of little lights in each bedroom showing which of the shared washrooms were available and which were occupied. Tip #1: Bring flip flops and slippers for the shower and walking in the hallway. Tip #2: Don’t forget to bring a hand towel when you go to the washroom. Tip #3: Earplugs might be useful.

I read thru pretty much every review before booking at Pod 51 and I'm glad I did. Overall, most are very positive and honest and that helped me have realistic expectations. For a solo traveler this place is PERFECT! It was affordable and the location is unbeatable. Just a few blocks from the Subway. Very central in the city. Safe. EASY EASY! I would guess Pod 39 is also an excellent place too.. great location too!I stayed in a tiny room with a twin bed and bathroom down the hall. Again, as a solo traveler this was fine with me.. obviously, if you are after a romantic get-away, this is not the place! On my floor there were 3 bathrooms with showers. I tried each one.. they were all a little different and I did develop a preference but not for any particular reason... layout? All were clean. There seemed to be hotel cleaning crew on our floor all day long so everything was very fresh even after the morning rush of showers. The hotel seems to be fully booked and they stay on the cleaning. You have your own towel(s) to take to the bathroom.. so don't forget! There are no robes provided so I would suggest taking something to travel back and forth after your shower.. I was wrapped in a pretty small towel & my flip flops in the hallway, not ideal but I never ran into anyone. What I loved about this place is the mix of guests! I think i heard at least 8 different languages in my 3.5 days at Pod 51! It is definitely a Euro style place and the older Europeans seem to really like it. I thought this was great and enhanced my visit. Everyone was very nice and I think the age diversity keeps it from being a party hotel. Definitely not just for kids! Yay. There is a sweet cafe in the lobby serving a perfect coffee and basic breakfast items. I padded down in the morning and got a bagel and coffee and took it back to my room. The girls that ran the cafe were very nice and the food was good & fresh. A lot of people hang out in the lobby/cafe eating and reading the paper. Good Vibes. And not over-priced. Bonus. The hotel has free Wi-Fi and if you arrive early, as I did, they will hold your bag until check-in time. There were no noise issues when I was there. I am sure if your room is on the front of the building on a lower floor you would have a bit of street noise as some others have mentioned.

Having said this, it had everything we needed, was clean and comfortable. The staff including reception, concierge and the maids were all extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to help. The location was great, it was my first time in New York so the roof terrace was a nice touch and the location was fantastic. A short walk a few blocks and you were on Lexington Avenue with the subway station and the Chrysler building towering above you. We were lucky with the weather (locals told us it was uncharacteristically warm and sunny for the time of year) so we happily walked on most days. Times Square was only 10 minutes or so away with the Empire State Building, Grand Central and a host of other land marks en route. Admittedly the room was small, however for the price we paid I have no complaints. Being young the bunk beds were not an issue, however if we were to go again I would consider a larger room with normal twin beds. I would 100% stay at pod 51 again and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.

Was it small? Yes. Did it have a shower and toilet? Yes. Was it clean? Yes. Was it convenient to Manhattan? Yes. Was it noisy at night? Yes.This is a hotel where you spend all your time out exploring all the delights of New York and only come back to your hotel to sleep.Customer service from the bell hops is hit and miss. When we arrived after a five hour flight from LA, we were a little tired and most of our belongings were locked up in suite cases. As soon as the taxi pulled up, a bell hop came racing out to place our luggage on a trolley and take it upstairs to our rooms. After he unloaded our luggage, I realised our money was with my wife booking in downstairs. I explained to the bell hop the position I was in and that my wife will tip him. 10 minutes later, the concierge rings our room, demanding to know where the bell hops tip is! To be honest, I was really cheesed off with his attitude. He wasn't the friendliest person I had ever met. Later during our stay, he would congregate near the lifts with the other bell hops speaking amongst themselves in Spanish. Not very professional. The maids were fantastic, our rooms were kept beautifully clean and they were friendly, not like some of the staff working there. As a result, we gave the maid looking after our room a nice big fat tip.The other things to bare in mind, is that not all the rooms have toilets and showers, so you will be woken during the night as guests slams doors whilst they go to the loo. It is a very noisy place to stay. The corridors are narrow and you can hear every bodies conversation outside, along with the flushing of toilets. Also, there is no small fridge or electric jug to make a coffee in your room. This was the hardest part for me, because I need a coffee first thing in the morning. Luckily there is a Starbucks just around the corner.

When someone was loud in the hall or played loud music an employee was up within a couple of minutes and sorted it out (that's why the hotel is receiving five stars instead of four). I don't agree that the rooms are cheap but for NYC they are fair. While this hotel seems to cater to a younger crowd don't hesitate to stay if you are above 35. My suggestions are: larger bath towels, a full length mirror and different way of making the bed.There are so many places to get coffee from (including the lobby area) that I didn't miss having a coffee/tea tray.

I slept with ear plugs and that resolved the noise issues.In room safe, coat hangers, towels (but no washcloths), shampoo, body lotion, and non-movable mounted flatscreen tv (with remote) were provided.Check-in staff seemed preoccupied at check in - I had to give my name four times.Location was great, near two subway stops (6 and E/M lines) and plenty of eating and drinking spots nearby. It's four blocks east of 5th Avenue shopping.I reserved a couple of months ahead, so was able to get a low rate. I'd prefer another hotel next time, but would stay here again if three conditions were met: (1) availability of a larger room (2) at an attractively low price and (3) no reasonable alternatives.","washington, dc",34,3.0

Being 19, my friend and I really couldn't book a hotel anywhere else, but staying at the Pod made me not want to go anywhere else. The rooms were small, yes, but it was plenty of room for 2 college students staying for 5 days. The hotel is in an excellent location, about a 10 minute walk from 30 Rock and Radio City, and there are several very good restaurants in the surrounding area. If you don't feel like staying close to your hotel, there is a subway station a block away. It's definitely not a place for families, or anyone that wants to spend more time in their hotel than outside because the sheer size of the place is not conducive to that, but it's perfect for anyone who plans on spending most of their trip seeing the city and only using the hotel to sleep. As for the cleanliness, it's not the cleanest hotel I've stayed at, for example my top sheet had a hole in it and the shared bathrooms were kind of gross at times. However, I complained about the sheet and the staff were very apologetic and it was immediately replaced, and I honestly didn't expect the bathrooms to be that clean because they are shared by an entire floor of people. I would recommend that the hotel installs toilet seat covers because even though the toilet appeared to be clean compared to the rest of the bathroom, the idea of my behind touching a seat that everyone else's behind has touched is super gross.","San Diego, California",1,4.0

The bar was closed due to refurbishment which was a shame but the cafe was very nice. Ate breakfast in it (or on the outdoor patio) most mornings while we planned our day. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby for grabbing something to eat. Close to the subway and therefore very easy to get around the city. Definitely worth checking out the Rooftop bar/garden. It has great views of the city day or night and is a nice place to hang out after a day exploring. Wifi was good but not great. Seemed to vary a lot depending on how many people were using it.

The only issue I had was that one side of the double bed is against the wall so you have no choice but to disturb the other person if you need to get up in the night. We checked out at 12:00 and paid $20 per person to get the hotel's shuttle bus (book it with the bell boy the day before) to the airport, which I think is a good deal as it will cost a lot more by taxi or train and the trains are a pain in the bum when you have luggage.

Assuming all floors are the same, there are 4 shared washrooms in different configurations for the floor. Two washrooms with toilet, sink and shower. One washroom that is only a shower. One washroom that is only a toilet (no sink, so bring hand sanitizer or be prepared to go back to your room to wash your hands). They were relatively clean and we never had to wait long for one. They even have lights in the room above the door to show which bathrooms are currently in use. A note about the showers though - you might have issues if you are tall as the shower head is on the ceiling not the wall. The room itself seemed very clean, and as long as you know what you are getting into with the size (which we did), it was great. My husband and I found the bunks kinda fun, with their individual tvs and such. Free wifi was good too. The only issue is the sound proofing was not great and we could hear conversations down the hall (not from other rooms but anyone out in the hallway talking). Fortunately, our fellow guests were pretty quiet as we didn't hear anything in the evening aside from a toilet flush now and then.The only issue we had during our stay was that we arrived at the designated check in time and the room wasn't ready and there was a quite a line up of people waiting. We lined up once to be told the room wasn't ready and then we had to line up again to see if it was.

On my second day, I found a bed bug crawling across my pillow. I called the front desk and they said they would send someone right away. A maintenance person came and took the pillow with the now dead bed bug on it and confirmed it was as I thought. He left immediately, so I began to go through my things to see if I could find more. There is so little space in the room that it's impossible to keep luggage away from the bed or floor. 20 minutes after the man left, I hadn't heard from anyone so I called the front desk and told them I would need a new room. I went downstairs to get a new key - not a word of concern from anyone about the bed bugs. They placed me in a room across from the elevator and a shared bathroom. It was LOUD. People were in and out of the elevators and bathroom all night long, talking loudly. As well, the radiators were banging loudly, so I woke up throughout the night. I called the front desk about it at 4AM and they said nothing could be done as the place was sold out. They had no manager on staff at the time and I was told he wouldn't be there until 9AM. When I told them I was leaving for the airport prior to that, they said they couldn't reach out to him prior as they're not allowed to call the manager, that I would have to call the hotel later. She wouldn't tell me how long he would be available or any other course of action to take. I have yet to be able to speak to the manager but definitely would not recommend this as a place to stay, despite the predominately positive reviews. Everything was great until an issue arose (which happens from time to time) but I was very disappointed in their reaction.","Chicago, Illinois",17,2.0

My friend and I were on somewhat of a budget, and given how expensive accommodation in NYC can be we decided on staying at this hotel. We were surprised at the amount of older people and business people who seemed to be staying in the hotel. We stayed in the 'Bunk Pod' room which was literally just a set of bunk beds, a desk, and a sink/basin area. Whilst the room itself was pretty small it was great value, the beds were super comfortable and the little TV's each bed had were pretty cool. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor which were shared between everyone on that floor. Initially I thought this would be an issue but it was great. In our room there was a board which would light up when someone was in a bathroom so you knew what bathrooms were free. The bathrooms were really good and spacious with great showers. Having a sink/basin area in our room was good meaning we didn't have to walk to the bathroom to do simple things such as brush our teeth our blow-dry hair.

Perfect for couples.We had a private bathroom but to be honest there is four shared bathrooms to each floor so if your on a budget I wouldn't mind going for this option, they are always kept clean and readily available, my wife is pregnant and doesn't keep well so we needed the security of a toilet.Location is fab and we only used the subway on the last day and should have utilised it more as its really quite easy and not as intimidating as you might think. Reception has a good map and they are always happy to give advice. I had a peak in a bunk bed room and it looked fun with personal tv in the bunks .Nearby places to eat recommend the smiths for finer dining and ess a bagel for breakfast.

They provide shower gel and shampoo in the bathrooms and the shower is amazing. The rooftop terrace offers an amazing view of the skyscrapers and the city beneath. It really takes your breath away.My only criticism I would have is that there are 3 lifts which didn't seem enough for 14 floors.All in all I would DEFINITELY stay here again and again.

It has a veneer of cool but it's not cool. The foyer feels like a small convention center or transportation hub but everywhere else I had access to: elevators, corridors, bathrooms, and most of all my room, space is cut to the bone. It's not cheap. My single room was $150. With taxes is was $175. I thought it was a rip-off. New York City is expensive but there is still such a thing as good value. I had a wonderful breakfast at Delectica, it was more than diner-prices but it was delicious, the coffee was mmmmm, just order some more. So well worth it. I spent half a day at the Guggenheim. It wasn't cheap but it was so amazing I became a member. So well worth it. I felt that my room at Pod 51 was like a prison cell, and perhaps was designed by people who had expertise in designing prison cells. I measured it roughly and it was 12 X 8 at its widest point (it was a little irregular), whereas a prison cell seems to be usually 6 X 8. On the back of the door there was a sign saying Make Room for Fun. There were four steps:1. Store your stuff (in drawers under the bed)2. Remove the bed cover. 3. Grab those Pod pillows (only one in my room)4. Start up the fun (picture of long black socks and short grey socks connecting)This seemed so cynical. Not fun. Pod 51 was impersonal, unpleasant, kind of a factory farm for milking people of money. Not a good place.","Rome, Italy",37,1.0

It was a corner room and two windows on each side. The bathroom was small too and I think it would not be comfortable if you are very heavy.The only complaint was that it was difficult to wash your face in the sink because the faucet spout was large and curved over the (very small) sink and got in the way! As a result, the water splashed onto the counter and ran down the front of the sink where the towels and extra toilet paper are stored, soaking them (we eventually moved them to the window sill) and down onto the floor (we kept a towel on the floor).The hotel has a youthful vibe because many rooms do not have en suite toilets and showers and we suppose the young guests traded that inconvenience for cheaper rates.There was no in-room refrigerator, no coffee maker, no gym, but the pros outweighed the cons and we would surely stay there again.","Atlanta, Georgia",11,4.0

Our room was also not ready at check-in time (3 p.m.) and we had to ask for pillowcases to be put on the pillows.

We had a bunk bed which was slightly wider than a normal one which was comfortable. I didn't like the metallic sink area as it just looks cheap and nasty whilst a ceramic one would be more in keeping for a bedroom. As the room was so small, it kept being stuffy so you turned on the air-con to bring down the temperature and some air.The bathrooms were small, one more than the other, but fairly clean and did the job, though it would be great if additional towels were left to wipe your feet or a plastic mat to absorb the water.As our room was opposite the lift, it was quite noisy with people talking at all hours of the night so it's not for light sleepers like me. Plus you can hear the rooms slamming especially the ones for the bathrooms which were close by. I would recommend some kind of noise insulation as it will make a difference for those that stay there and affected by noise.I ordered coffee a couple of times which was fine thought $4.50 was rather steep for a small cup.

But it's SO handily located that I do usually decide to stay here.It's a boutique crossed with a budget hotel, in a way, as many of the rooms don't have a bathroom so you'll need to share those along the corridor. However some rooms do have en-suite showers and loos, although of course these cost more. I've stayed in both the en-suite and non-en-suite rooms and both styles have been fine - though it’s perhaps obvious which I prefer!The rooms ARE SMALL. But I don't really mind that much at all, as I tend to only use my room as a base for sleeping, and spend most of my time out and about in NYC. So I think it's an OK trade-off seeing as the hotel is relatively reasonably priced for one of this quality in such a location. Yes it's not ""cheap"", but nothing will be in this location. (Or if by some miracle there were something ""cheap"" located around here, I doubt it'd be of a quality I'd want to experience!)Décor is nice: quite funky and trendy, and it’s certainly clean and well maintained. It’s a shame that they’ve shut the bar-restau attached to the hotel, for refurbishment, as it was nice too, but it doesn’t really matter as there are lots and lots (and lots) of great places to eat and drink in this neighbourhood. I can think of at least ten places I have enjoyed within a 2 minute walk of the hotel.The staff are generally nice and pretty helpful, though I think they’re rather busy most of the time. And there’s a café next to the lobby that is handy for a quick bite before heading out…I like their coffee and chunky bagels of a morning. A nice zap of energy to start the day.Finally, and I think this is what really reassures me, I have met a couple other guests on this particular stay, over coffee, who are New Yorkers who have moved away from Manhattan but who used to live in this neighbourhood. Both of them (separately) stated how this is the hotel they choose when they’re back visiting the city, either for work or play. To me that seals the deal. If locals like it as well as tourists, it must be a winner.","Plymouth, UK",14,4.0

I actually stayed at the hotel numerous decades ago when it was the Pickwick Arms, and I paid $12.00 a night, with a sagging bed, and a single light bulb overhead. I have stayed at the hotel number times since then (when it was still the Pickwick Arms), and things definitely improved, and the prices stayed very, very reasonable, especially for New York. This was my first time at the Pod51, and the value was indeed excellent, and with more improvements . The room, and the hallways were very clean. Even the hall baths were secured by key card only, also a positive development. The roof garden was wonderful on a balmy summer night, with the nighttime view of New York unbeatable. Yes, the room was quite small, and it was a challenge as I had a good deal of luggage. But the room, as mentioned was very clean,, and very functional. This includes limited but usable storage space, and a very workable, albeit small, bathroom. I had a little trouble handling the air conditioning my first night, but it eventually kicked in. But the base price under $200 a night, was a great bargain, especially for New York. So, I cannot the room size. I did not take advantage of the breakfast and beverage service. But I appreciated the small garden, as an added extension of the hotel. I loved the East 51st Street, location. The neighborhood is actually called Turtle. Right across the street from the hotel is the fantastic Green Acre Park; one of the most magnificent pocket parks to be found anywhere: waterfall, seats to relax or read or have a nosh. The hotel was two blocks from the Lexington subway, train # 6; and two blocks from the E and M trains at 52nd and Third Avenue. The neighborhood is filled with many restaurants, and within walking distance of the United Nations, and other interesting sights. Actually, there are wonderful residential areas to admire the setting and architecture e.g. Turtle Bay Gardens, Tudor City Gardens, and Beekman Place, etc. I liked the fact it was in a semi-residential area, but extremely accessible to the attractions of Midtown. I had minimal contact with the front desk, but check-in was smooth and efficient. There was a concierge, but I did not make use of the service.

Despite it's quasi-budget status (just over nine hundred bucks for 4 nights, tax included), a very friendly porter immediately appeared to help unload my small, solitary bag and my partner's articulated lorry-load of luggage.Checking in through the quirky lobby, decorated largely with pictures of litter and graffiti (who am I to critique art?), we breezed up to our room with private loo and shower (not a standard feature, just FYI), and this where I had the first ""Oh"" moment. For those of you that have passed through the British Higher Education system, you might understand my meaning when I explain that the room felt strikingly similar to my old Halls of Residence. Nonetheless, it was clean, comfortable and made up every day, and once I took over responsibilities for the air-con from The Boss (who had managed to turn it off rather than on for the first night) I couldn't fault it. And who spends a long time in their hotel room in Manhattan anyway?! Heading back down, we quickly discovered the location of the bar/café (which, I'm sure you'll agree, is of paramount importance), and were pleasantly surprised to discover a wide range of interesting food and drink, from craft ales and truffled popcorn, to prosecco and a 'pickle plate' (how many different ways can there be to preserve cucumber in vinegar?). The staff are also wonderfully friendly, even when my inherent Celtic stinginess led me to forget to tip on a couple of occasions.Once you've got your truffled craft pickles and vegan charcuterie, you might want to pop up to the roof deck on the fifteenth floor to enjoy them. However, while comfortable, unless you enjoy watching office workers play minesweeper and teenagers smoking weed on the roofs of adjacent buildings, don't get too excited about the view.All in all, I'm not sure you can really call this a 'budget' hotel, although neither would you say it is life in the lap of luxury. However you describe it, though, it is a cracking little base from which to explore Manhattan, and I thoroughly recommend a visit.","York, United Kingdom",3,4.0

Location wise you could not have asked for more as it was so easy to get to the tourist attractions from here. We never managed to make it to the roof terrace and the cafe was under construction so we only ate breakfast once. Mine did take a really long time to arrive but it was lovely when it did. The staff were always very helpful and thankfully arranged a shuttle taxi for us at the cost of 20 dollars each to the airport when we left, bargain. Only a few niggling criticisms. No room service. Also the TV was on the wall but not at the best angle to be seen from the bed and not able to move it. The hotel represents excellent value for money and looks slick and stylish. I liked the bathroom a lot. It doesn't have a view but then I don't think many in New York do. We never let the cleaners into our room as we are messy but I had read about how good they were and to be fair when we passed them cleaning in the hallway they full on gut a room so they are thorough.

Two of us stayed here for one week over New Years and we're very impressed especially as it known as an up marked hostel. Our room was very clean and had good storage facilities. We did book a room with bunk beds and no toilet which definitely wasn't as bad as we had imagined. Beds could be more comfortable but the small tvs on each bunk are great and the sink in the room very handy. If you book a room without a shower or toilet you will need to make use of these facilities outside of your room. These were very clean every day and we always had fresh towels to bring into the bathrooms. In your room you will see a panel above the door which lights up to tell you which bathroom is free to use. So there is very little waiting around as you have around 4 on each floor. One bathroom in particular was floor to ceiling marble and was like a 5star wet room. What a fab find. On the third day of or stay we awoke to find cockroaches in our room to which I went down and informed the front desk, they didn't seem bothered at all and I didn't even get an apology. I did demand a new room and we were not even offered help moving to that room considering it was a disgusting find and the hotel should ensure this doesn't happen. The hotel's response made me believe that the cockroaches are a normal find in their hotel which I find to be shocking in NYC. I havnt even found this in rooms across rural Turkey. However after our room change we had a pleasant stay and the vending machines and bar connecting from the front desk area are handy.

Luckily we asked to change and the second room on floor 5 was much better - a little extra space in the corner and brighter!The maid came every day and tidied up, which did make a difference given the lack of space.The beds were comfy and we never had to wait for the shared bathrooms, which had hot water and rain shower. The shower gel provided smelt good too.The breakfast at Pod was ok but recommend instead that you go straight over the road to the waterfall and eat there - it's very peaceful, outdoors and also cheaper!Sadly we didnlt use the roof top much as it was raining most the time, but would be great in the sun.Service was very mixed! Some of the staff more friendly than others, the maid was friendly.We would return again if back in the city, though would probably pay the extra 100 quid for a double bed rather than the bunks.",Devon,36,4.0

Pod 51 turned out to be in a great location and was by far definitely one of the cheaper options in manhatton. We were on a budget so opted for a bunk bed room and a shared bathroom. When we arrived someone was quick to take our bags and we checked in with no problem. When we got to our room it was on level 4 and noticeably damp but clean. We asked to move room and this was done fairly easily and our next room on level 5 was much fresher and cleaner.The cleaners at the pod were excellent and all rooms and bathrooms were cleaned daily, and I surprisingly thought the shared bathrooms were fine. Considering the rooms are tiny, I think it's not really worth getting a room with a bathroom as they are the size of someone's wardrobe! If you are claustrophobic not the hotel for you! To get away from the claustrophobia of new York the rooftop bar was great as long as the sun is shining!! The breakfast bar was good and don't expect a smile with your bagel (or in most places in manhatton ha).. For a change I recommend the waterfall over the street which has breakfast there as well. Really close to the subway and felt like a safe neighbourhood. ","Exeter, United Kingdom",7,4.0

It's walking distance from most of the tourists locations. I'd say the beginning of Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Empire State and Times Square is less than a 20 minute walk. You can get downtown using the Subway on 51st and Lexington - that only takes about 20 minutes. There's a lot of takeaway/fast food places nearby and there's a police and fire station on the next block.The pods are very small there's just enough room for the bed and some storage space. We opted for a double room with our own bathroom. Although we took a peek in one of the shared bathrooms and they looked fine. Now the bathrooms in the rooms really don't feel like they are in a separate room. They are about the size of a wardrobe and the shower windows face into the room so you've got to be pretty friendly with whoever you're sharing with (I've attached a picture). I think you can only get your own bathroom in the double rooms. If you're sharing a bed with someone then I don't expect this will be a problem. The rooms are very clean. Our room was cleaned every day, without fail. Regardless of how late we left the room housekeeping had been in to spruce the place up. Definitely tip these guys, they do a sterling job! The rest of the staff seem a little hit or a miss. One day we got coffee in the lobby and the lady serving was lovely. On another day, the other lady was less than lovely. No one was by any means bad, just nothing to go crazy about. Although that seemed the norm around New York. They cafe in the lobby is nice, they have a simple menu. Which I'm not going to list here as you can find that out on their website. The cafe does serve bagels from the very popular place on the corner (Ees-A-Bagel). This place sometimes has queues out the door so if you just want a simple bagel with cream cheese grab it from Pod 51. It looks like they are building a proper cafe/bar as part of the hotel which looks like it will be nice. The rooftop garden is beautiful and a great place to catch the sun but, as far as I could tell, no bar.If I had to pick holes my complaints would be that the AC units were very loud (it was hitting 30+ Celsius so they were running non-stop) but they done there job and kept the place nice and cool. Also our view wasn't great just into the opposite rooms but we managed to find the humour in that, comparing it to old friends episodes. I had a good time at Pod 51 and I would definitely recommend it for your trip to NYC. I'll give it a four stars because it is a good place to stay in Midtown. Although it could still be better.

Nestled between 2nd and 3rd Avenue, Pod51 is just far enough away from the crowds and yet so close to so much from Top of the Rock to Central Park. The hotel was chosen by my ten year old daughter after she had seen the Pod Hotel on Travelsupoermarket.com and it was perfect. Yes the rooms are small but what are you doing in New York City if you are simply staying in a hotel room? The staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble for any of them. Our room was tidied every single day and it was always a joy to come back to a tidy room after sightseeing for seven or eight hours! The shared bathrooms were fantastic and I've never felt safer in the shower than in those granite floors. I could let my ten year old go to the bathroom with confidence as I could see which bathrooms were available (never more than two out of the four were occupied) and then watch the display above the door to see when she had left the bathroom and she was always back within 16 seconds. While the bathrooms are shared for the room we had, some rooms do have their own bathroom if you really need that added privacy. There is a little sink in the room as well as two TVs (one for each bunk, a safe, a desk and aircon that you have control over. I would definitely visit again. Hopefully soon!",,10,5.0

The room was tiny, but with relatively large beds, the bathroom is only separated by a sliding glass door, so when you are two people living in the room, one has to leave the room when the other uses the toilet.... Very clean and quiet room and the service in the reception is excellent. The price range for the hotel rooms are a bit too high considering the size of the room, but you are situated close to Grand Central so that is probably what you have to pay.

We also managed to walk to places further afield like Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State Building in a relatively short period of time. On our last morning we had to get the Metro to JFK. We were able to do so from a stop right outside the hotel. We really could not have been in a better spot for our first trip to New York. We felt safe and secure in the neighbourhood. I highly recommend the shop Treehouse down the road for food and drink. We visited this place every day. The public areas of the hotel were modern and clean; the entrance and lounge made for an impressive first view. I have to say the rooms themselves were not quite as attractive as the ones on The Pod website. Between us all we had three rooms and each one was in need of a bit of an update compared with what we had seen online. Look at the Trip Advisor traveller photos for a more accurate representation. There was always someone ready to take your luggage to your room upon arrival which we thought was excellent service for a hostel.

What are you waiting for? Book this hotel! I just came back from Manhattan and stayed at Pod 51 from May 4-7th. I travelled this time with my 30 yr. old daughter instead of my husband. Booking at Pod 51 was a big change from the usual hotels I book when in New York. My daughter has spent time travelling in Europe and suggested Pod 51. This hotel is a slightly more 'bohemian' hotel, with much smaller more efficient rooms, very compact but well-designed. We got lucky when booking and got a corner room with its own tiny bathroom and windows that open for cross-ventilation. Pod 51 boasts an open-air foyer with an adjacent terrace and garden, a roof top patio and an all-round awesome environment. Pod 51 staff are very friendly (except for the grumpy, disinterested and inappropriate staff in the coffee shop), Staff generally provided great directions and advise about local spots - quite different from other New York hotel experiences over the past 20 years. The coffee shop makes excellent coffee and sells Balthazar pastries and bagels.This hotel is on 51st street at Lexington. Its is close to world-class shopping opportunities! Every well-known New York landmark or designer store is within walking distance. Or- you can hop on the subway at 53rd and Lexington and take the subway to lower mid-town for more shopping. Central Park is only 9 blocks walk away from the hotel. The United Nations complex is 3 blocks from this hotel. There is a terrific Japanese restaurant and a French restaurant on either side of Pod 51, Organic Avenue at 54th and Lexington, several amazing deli eateries, etc. within 2 blocks - no shortage of food for every budget.Several hotel guests stored their bicycles in a locked enclosure adjacent to the lobby. .

Being first timers in NY, roaming the most of the southern half of Manhattan plus Brooklyn and Williamsburgh, the location of Pod 51 turned out to be close to perfect. The subway is very near serving you more than one useful line, and you have a few of the city's great sights within walking distance (like Chrysler Building, Grand Central). The rooftop is excellent with sparse but cozy furniture and a great, (almost) un-interrupted 360 view to the eclectic skyline of the neighbourhood. Our room at the rear on 9th floor (with attached bath) was neatly and efficiantly designed (found the drawers under the bed very useful for storing clothes). The bathroom design and integration in the tiny room is smart but may be challenging, even for close couples, if privacy is crucial when using toilet as well as shower. The view was excelent from the room, and the window pane allows you to sit by the window and enjoy the crazy buildings. The everpresent airing systems from the hotel and adjecent buildings does create quite some noice (we had to leave the window open to keep the temperature pleasent in the room).

After showing them my email confirmation of a queen, they quickly resolved the issue and gave us a queen pod on the 4th floor. This place is clean, and well maintained, and they definitely make the most of the limited space available. If you have cruised before, this is the best definition of what to expect when staying here. I was aware of this before I booked, but the amenities offered greatly outweigh any concern over space. We decided on this hotel because it was clean, reasonably comfortable, and convenient to Mid Town, Central Park, Times Square, and most of all, because it had a private bathroom! Most hotels in this area with a private bath, will run you approx. $300 per night, whereas you can book a queen pod for around $200. With that being said, taller people beware! If you are 6'5"" or taller, you may have headroom issues navigating this place.  This place is located in the Upper East side on 51st street, and is just a few blocks away from a couple of key subway stations, that can provide easy access to all of New York City. For us it was quite convenient for us to just walk to most places that we wanted to visit such as St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Theater District, and Central Park. Pros: Clean, Convenient, Reasonably Quiet(Just turn on the AC fan), Private Bath, Free storage for you luggage on check out day if you don't leave until the afternoon or evening.Cons: Mattress was too firm(cheap), Small TV, Cramped Bathroom.Bottom Line: If you want a clean, comfortable, and convenient place to stay in NYC for a reasonable price, this is the place!","Hays, Kansas",48,4.0

It was nearly 4:00am when I went to check in. I booked this property and have stayed here before because my fiancé works only several blocks away and I have had a pleasant experience each time I have stayed here. The last time I booked here, I stood for an entire weekend and it was just great. This stay was a different story. As it turns out, I inadvertently booked a reservation for check in on Monday April 13, 2015 as opposed to check in April 12, 2015. Obviously, when I showed up at nearly 4:00am tired, sleepy and just wanting the room I thought I had just booked for RIGHT NOW, I was met with a very cold individual at the front desk. He said, with no remorse or alternative to my dilemma that I had made this reservation for another day and therefore he could not check me in and that I had to wait until check in time.Although I personally knew of every single option he could of offered me, the only thing at all he offered me was to cancel the reservation with Expedia and book a new reservation with him at his rate which wasn’t all that different from what I had just paid anyhow. He sounded like a broken record on repeat. Why? Why do I have to do it that way Corey? Maybe I don’t feel like having to spend yet again for a room I just booked. Yes, your right, Expedia will refund me in about a week or so by WHY do I have to go through that because of your laziness and lack of the actuality of your job… HOSPITALITY! Yes, I am sure I can make your life so much easier so that you do not actually have to carry out some real work here by doing me a repeat guest a favor and carrying out an accommodation for someone that enjoys staying here. I was calm the entire time and never became belligerent at any point with this guest service agent. I guess I was just blown away at Corey’s non-existent effort to help out a guest that had sincerely made a minor booking error. I went to the extent of calling Expedia in front of Corey and they said they even offered to contact the hotel to send over approval for the modification of the date for this reservation. Guess what? They did as promised and phoned Corey right in front of me. He stuck with his guns and turned them down also and told them the same thing he told me. What a star! He reiterated that at the most, if I chose to cancel the reservation he would okay not imposing a fee. Madness! I wasn’t trying to cancel the reservation buddy; I was just sincerely trying to check in. I wasn’t a drunken guest being rude to you; I wasn’t causing you any trouble. In all sincerity, I just wanted to get up to my room in a familiar place and you ruined my night there. You really did! What made matters worse with this agent was that he teased me and said I have your room available now, I just can’t give it to you unless you book again directly with us. Not necessarily pal, you have options here with me. Expedia has agreed to exchange my reservation as far as the dates were concerned. Don’t want to go that route? No problem! Even if you’ve rolled over numbers already, zero out and day-use a room since I told you that I only needed the room until the afternoon anyhow. The point here is that you could have helped me and you chose not to. It’s sad because I have never taken to Trip Advisor, that’s how I know this experience ate away at me. And it did, it ate away at me while I was forced to leave with my case back to my fiancés office at that time of night because of the inner anger this gentleman caused me. Hey no offense buddy, but as a former hotelier in management and concierge positions of 4 and 5 star properties in NYC, I’ve welcomed families of four and five people at 5 or 6am when I knew inventory I had to work with was suffice. He said there was nothing he could do or help me with due to hotel policy and showed no attempt to help me as he went back to sit down on his personal computer. I decided to return from my fiancées office at around 7:30am to try my hand with a different individual. That didn’t go as planned because when I returned Mr. Corey was still there and it’s who I was met with yet again. I told him listen it’s this many hours later so whenever you decide you do have a room for me, I will be sitting here waiting. He quickly shot back that he no longer had a room for me and that Expedia had called to cancel the reservation. I asked him what you are talking about. I quickly told him Expedia only called to inquire if you would impose a penalty ‘IF’ I decided to cancel the reservation. That did not mean I was actually canceling the reservation. He said well on our end it does, so we cancelled the reservation.  You can imagine that at this point with this Corey fellow, I was thinking there is no way it could be personal, because I have never done anything to this individual. Could his level of laziness be this in-depth that this was what I had to settle for as a repeat guest at a place I really enjoyed staying. I was too tired to argue with this agent so I told him I would call Expedia to confirm what they had ‘supposedly’ done with my reservation for arrival Monday April 13, 2015.A couple of minutes into getting back on the phone with Expedia, I was on hold waiting to speak to a representative and sitting a few feet away from the front desk. Suddenly, I could hear Corey calling out to me SIR, SIR. I came over after he had some words with Andrew, who could serve has a witness and he told me in a whisper that he now had a room available for me and that he didn’t know how this happened, but that Expedia must of sent over another reservation. Really? I have never been taking for such a ride in my life as guest in any hotel in New York City up until this experience.  I must have been so traumatized by this agent that I didn’t even trust him with sensitive information of mine that’s how bad it was. I opted to leave him cash for incidentals instead of trusting him with my credit card and rightfully so. I mean the entire night you’ve been unhelpful, turned me away like nothing, and now were just out right lying to me without you knowing that I know and value the industry better than you ever could pal. I managed to get several hours of sleep up until 11:00am or so and decided that all of my plans had to be changed because of the type of night I was put through. I figured I would stay until Tuesday now, and I went down to the front desk and spoke to Jessica Brea to give her a synopsis of what I had been through. Jessica was very helpful and exemplified everything a guest service agent stands for. During my conversation with her, I was even interrupted by guests just to say hello to her and give thanks for whatever it was she had also done for them. Jessica took the time to hear me out, and even offered me an upgrade because I mentioned to her that I always stay in the same room type which is the Queen or Full private room type. She was a sweetheart who actually took the few minutes needed to hear me out and applied it to my reservation. I will be honest, in no way did it erase the kind of horrific experience that night man put me through at all, but I will tell you this, there are many other hotels I can stay at when I come to town near my Fiancée’ place of work, and honestly, Jessica B. is the only reason I will ever even dare stay and step foot at Pod 51 again.

NYC hotels are just expensive and it's difficult to find a basic, low priced option that is clean and comfy. Pod 51 fits that bill. It may not be the most well-appointed hotel for every traveler - especially Americans. Compact spaces, minimal amenities and slightly noisy with younger/inconsiderate guests for neighbors. But it lives up to it's expectations budget-wise, and far exceeded my expectations for cleanliness. I cannot say enough how great the housekeeping staff were!! They were a constant, friendly presence and very thorough in their jobs. I enjoyed a single room with a shared bath. Adequate cable channels. And WiFi with a strong signal. Like other reviewers have mentioned, every time I used the shared bath, it was freshly cleaned and always available. The few aspects of this hotel that I did not find comfortable:1.) The shower: very small, claustrophobic space. And the shower head is on the ceiling. So it was very difficult to take a shower and not get my hair wet. 2.) The in-room temp control: Very happy to be able to control my own temperature. However, it was a very finicky sort of radiator. I had to really fiddle with it sometimes to get it to turn on. And once it was on, the room got very hot (even for me - I enjoy a room that gets up to 80 degrees!) And I burned my hand on it trying to turn it down in the dark in the middle of the night. 3.) The water in my in-room sink was coming out yellow/brown. Eww.As an experienced traveler, however I would still prefer going to a Marriott or boutique hotel with standard en suite rooms for maximum comfort. But for my money in NYC, I was content with my choice of Pod 51. So if price is a consideration, Pod 51 is a good option to for you. However, if you are very particular about your hotel needs (noise level, space, amenities) then you should add $50 per night to your budget and stay somewhere else.","Los Angeles, California",17,3.0

The toilettries were a pleasant surprise too. The room was clean and comfy and the shared bathrooms were always clean as well. We had breakfast in the cafe each morning and cannot fault this either.

Paid $89 per night. The hotel is located off Lower Manhattan so you can either be the first to be dropped off or the last. You enter through a front door and run straight into a curtain- really no idea why they need this curtain/drape thing. First impression is that the hotel had a very contemporary lobby with modern art and comes with an area that makes you wanna just relax and hang out. Check in was fast, not very friendly or inviting- kinda like a no-frills, here's all your info, have a good stay experience. They have bell service- was a surprise for me. I booked this hotel thinking it was a hostel like place. The room as per usual NYC standard was very tiny. A single bed on the right, a small wardrobe (bar to hang your things) towards the left and a small sink. The bathroom is towards the elevator. For a solo person and a single night, this room was perfect. All basic amenities (clock, toiletries, towels, hair dryer) that were required could all be found in the room. I had no issues with the room at all. The bathroom was clean when I used it at about 3am. Water pressure was good and water got hot fast. The bathroom is also slightly heated so you don't feel a sudden chill after stepping out of the shower. Wi-Fi is free in this hotel- fast and reliable, had no issues with it. Location wise- There are many restaurants and cafe around the hotel. I had dinner at the Morning Star Cafe that's located in the back- great food! Times Square is a quick 15 minutes walk away. My trip this purpose was just to catch Aladdin on Broadway so I can't speak for the distance to the other NYC attractions. My research did show a subway station 2- 3 minutes away from the hotel.

The bathroom was much larger than I expected and the bed was very comfortable. It would have been nice to have a duvet or a thicker blanket, but the heating system was good so I was warm enough. My comments about the bathroom: The shower isn't separated from the rest of the bathroom by an enclosure; it's just part of the room, although there is of course a shower curtain. There are two drains in the floor to catch the water, but the water didn't go into the second drain so there was a huge puddle of water in the bathroom. Also, the sliding door separating the bathroom from the bedroom had a malfunction and didn't close all the way, which would have been a problem if you were sharing the room, but obviously it wasn't an issue since I was by myself.The hotel has a cafe, which was convenient for breakfast. I got an espresso and a croissant and they were both good. I was able to print my airline boarding pass in the lobby using my iPad and the hotel printer, but they have a few iPads for public use too.

Researched loads of hotels, wanted a feel-good experience, no large chain, landed on Pod 51 for proximity to MoMA, Central Park, and Times Square. It was perfect. European feel— modern, economy of space, modern lounge/cafe area, great music and decor, not boring. Loved the vibe. Laid back but professional. Doormen surprised me for a low-spend option, but a welcome touch. Rooms, yes, small. Queen with private bath just right for me, maybe too tight with husband. Definitely snug quarters, but found it comfortable.• Walked home from Barrymore Theater at 11:00p, bit of a hike in the cold, but safe. Room heater didn't click on. Called front desk. She was up within the hour. Heater came on before she got there then worked fine, front desk brought an extra blanket anyway. Outside temp = COLD. Inside my Pod= Warm & Cozy. :)• Restaurant closed for remodeling, but looks like a great space and would like to stay when it's open. Lounge area serves breakfast until late morning, snacks and drinks after. Perfect to sit with laptop, work or read, in quiet company of other interesting/international guests. • All quiet on my floor, but loud talking could have been heard through the door. • Hotel and room was very clean and met all my needs as single traveler.

I never had to wait once for a bathroom). The bathrooms were also super clean! A little compact and squishy, but most importantly it was clean and had everything we needed. It is in such a good location in Manhattan, walking distance to so many places! It is located on a quieter street and it really has a neighbourhood vibe to it. It is so trendy, cute and spotless! They have happy hour at the café downstairs and Mimosa pitcher's for breakfast.... how can you go wrong with this. The concierge is so helpful, they have iPads to use downstairs so that you can plan your daily activities, there is a bell man who will arrange your transportation for you and they also of FREE walking tours of New York on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They also have a printer free of charge in case you need to print out tickets, directions, maps, etc.The staff are all very friendly and helpful.

The toilet faces the bed with a frosted door inbetween, so you have to be pretty comfortable with who you are sharing with! Headbutted the wall trying to shower, twice, on the basis of how small the in room shower cubicle is.

First off, this hotel is in a super convenient location. Near to the subway and walking distance to Broadway. It’s in between a few sushi restaurants and around the corner from a Dos Caminos and Duane Reade. I was able to check in early, which was nice. The front desk staff was very pleasant. That being said, I was in a Queen Pod room on the 4th floor. (I managed to check out the shared bathrooms for the smaller rooms on my way. Nice to say they were very clean.) I got to my room, and as I suspected, it was very small (but that’s not uncommon for NYC). I bathroom was even smaller. If you closed the bathroom door, your knees were practically touching the door when sitting on the toilet. And you walked past the toilet to get to the shower. Reminded me of dorm bathrooms. There was also a little window in the bathroom, my guess was to let in extra light, but if you were sharing the room with someone, they could definitely see in.The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of outlets to charge your devices (which I find a lot of hotels lack) There was a TV, free wifi, a small desk, a no-door closet, a pull-down coast hook, and under the bed storage drawers. There were small shampoos, conditioners, and lotions stocked in the bathroom. My only, very minor, complaint was that it took a LONG time to get hot water in the shower. But it was clean and really all I needed for 2 nights. Not much of a view, but again, I’m not there to stay in the hotel.The lobby was small, but had tables and vending machines so you could get a quick bite to eat. There was also a concierge who looked to be helping tourists with planning and directions. Check out was easy and I was able to store my bag while I continued to go around the City.

You can't beat the price. If it's not the mid-winter, you won't for sure. The best deals are around this time. I paid $65 for a single shared bath pod. It's not really a pod though. Just a standard NYC sized single room equal to what you find with most boutique budget accommodations. The bed looks more like a couch, but I am only 5' 7"", so I fit in it perfectly, and had a good night's sleep. The sink area was spotless, and the TV (although remote did not work) was built into the wall, and managed to save additional room. There was a chair, storage drawers underneath the couch/bed, and a chair to sit in, although where you sit in the room has its limitations. My window sort of had a view of the city, and it was plenty bright and refreshing. One thing I liked was the fact that no other room was sharing wall space with me. On one side was a stair entry, and the other was a small utility closet. It was generally very very quiet. Very clean. Above my door was a graphic of the 4 shared bathrooms on my floor. If one was being used, a light was on. So you knew you had a free pass. The bathroom was never being used that was closest to me, and the shower was amazing. Best one I have ever had in New York.The hallway usually play some kind of modern hip yet relaxing pop music. Many world travelers come here, and the age group tends to be in their 20s-30s. I a bit older, but I seemed to fit right in. There is a small gastro pub in the lobby, but I would suggest only using it for your morning snack or afternoon bite, since the hours are limited, and sometimes, only the basics are covered. But its there, and it looked like a nice to place to relax. The location is pretty good too, a short walk can get you to Times Square, Central Park and especially close to Rockefeller Center. The train is two blocks away and can get you cross town in a hurry. I generally don;t care for Midtown East, but this area is uptown enough to shake off some of the Frat Boy dust that clings to areas just below. Everything was great, and with the price as it was, I would certainly seek it out again. Anybody else seeking a small, clean, hip, modern and cheap hotel could not do better than giving Pod some consideration.","Northampton, Massachusetts",87,4.0

You'd be better off to sleep in the the bathtub than the uncomfortable bed.

In all fairness the nice guy at the front desk did offer to move me to a higher floor, but packing up in the middle of the night isn't exactly the solution I was looking for at 4 in the morning. The hotel is clean and inexpensive for NY, but I'm not sure that saving a few bucks is worth the frustration of repeatedly being jarred awake by slamming bottles and the bone shaking sound of metal behemoths compacting their night's collections right outside your window.

They were always clean. Huge rainshower type shower heads. So nice. If there was any negatives it would be we can't control the heat or air- so without an open window it would have been waaaaay too hot. But an open window fixed that.

Let me make it very clear: these rooms are tiny. VERY tiny.My housemate was able to touch the sink without any issues from her side of the bed. We didn't unpack much as there simply wasn't room and we had to create an elaborate system in the bathroom so each of us could shower without the other seeing through the glass.But once you're used to it, the room is great. It's bright and, in winter, it's very easy to keep warm.The staff are very polite and helpful and the hotel itself is situated in the perfect area - we pretty much walked everywhere and it's only a few blocks from the ""back end"" of Time Square.Ultimately, if you want a stylish room, but aren't planning on being there long and you're going with a person who you are very comfortable with, then this is the hotel for you!I strongly recommend booking a room that has a private bathroom rather than sharing!","Exeter, United Kingdom",31,4.0

We then went to the room and the lack of space not just in the room but hotel generally became evident - the elevator was tiny, we had to lift our bags over the cleaners equipment to fit down the hallway and we actually laughed when we saw the size of the room. Having said that, once settled in, we realised the room was all we needed! The beds were comfortable, there were shelves and hooks for storage, it was clean, there was a little desk and sink and window that opened. We also had a great view (14th floor) and our room was quiet and away from the elevators and bathroom! The communal bathrooms were super modern and spotless. Sharing a bathroom wasn't even a problem, we only ever had to wait 10 minutes or so (max) to get in.  The hotel had good internet, a cheap drink vending machine and a lovely rooftop terrace set up with tables and chairs. Despite it being so cold, we took dinner up there one night and it was really peaceful. All in all, the hotel had everything we needed and we really enjoyed it.

As a result I would probably skip the en suite next time, it really wasn't that necessary considering the shared facilities were so good.The only downside is the walls were genuinely paper thin, every time the lift moved, or someone opened their door I felt like they were in our room, but you soon get used to the hustle and bustle and mostly we were so tired from sightseeing we slept through it!

For example we needed to do some laundry and the front desk basically gave us a card for a local cleaner and couldn't/wouldn't tell us much else. Similarly I asked a couple of times if I we were legible for any discounts because of our prolonged stay and the front desk kept telling me to speak to the manager who was never available.

People complained about the noise in some reviews but for the most part this wasn't an issue for me - I slept with a mask and earplugs.

But hey, you’re not in NYC for the room, so not the end of the world.- We reserved an en-suite room and asked for a quiet room in advance. The rather uncharismatic receptionist ensured us that our room would be quiet. My wife and I have never had a worse night sleep than our first night at the Pod. Our room was located right next to the shared bathrooms which, for a reason I will never understand, have doors that close automatically at an ear-battering sound. We woke up every time someone had to take a pee. And apparently people drink a lot in NYC. At the end of the day the main purpose of a hotel is to get a good night’s sleep, if this is not possible, it’s not possible to receive a positive review. On the positive side, we checked out of our room the next morning and got an upgrade to a double queen room in the corner away from the shared bathrooms. We never got an apology though, rather got the feeling that we should be really grateful for the upgrade.

I had a late event in the City and just needed a place to crash. Just me, no family. Based on the reviews and the price point (which was definitely cheaper than most hotels but not ""cheap"" i.e. $300.00 for a ""Full Pod""). I was expecting a tiny functional room that was clean and in a good location. The location is indeed great; you are right in mid-town so you are close to everything including easy public transportation. Check in was fine and efficient and the free drink coupon was a nice touch...so far so good. The lobby area was nice and as advertised with a coffee shop feel. The elevators were slow and tiny but not a big deal and still all good. The room itself was also ""as advertised"", small and efficient.....so on first impressions I was still a believer that this was a good choice. Unfortunately, the tides turned. The room seemed like it was was 90 degrees and there are no controls other than opening and closing the small window in the bathroom. The design of the room is solid but it was not nearly as clean as I hoped. The carpet had very worn pile and was not clean in spots as if there were spills that had dried. The bathroom had mildewed grout and the toilet seat was not secured and I almost fell off the thing when I shifted. The bed itself has a very thin mattress which was uncomfortable and linens that were course. The towels were right from a cheap gym. So, bottom line: I was trying to be smart and save money on a hotel where I wasn't planning to spend much time. I just needed to check in, change, come back hours later sleep, wake up and leave. Unfortunately, the savings, in my opinion, was not worth the discomfort and the experience. The concept is brilliant but the execution is flawed.","New York City, New York",43,2.0

The room decor is simple (think Ikea) but functional. The lobby and common areas are tasteful and fun. Plus the connectivity is fast and reliable. And, if you have the right attitude, the small bathroom can be fun! Like using a toilet on a plane, but with tile. One note: If there are two of you in your party, and you don't know each other well when you arrive, you will when you leave. There is only 6 feet distance from the bed to the toilet, separated by only a sliding door. If you need a George Costanza ""buffer zone"" then watch out. Also, don't drop anything in the shower, because there's hardly enough room to turn around, much less bend over. And recall my 6'4"" height? I could not fit under the showehead, which is in the middle of the shower.I would stay here again. Yes, it's noisy with a window out only 51st St. but it's always noisy in NY.

We could also hear noise from the street which didn't bother us at all but something to keep in mind for light sleepers.The room was clean and compact. Not tiny by European standards but small for US visitors I think. For two slim built under 6 footers this was fine. It doesn't feel claustrophobic. There is definitely only room for one person in the bathroom at a time though. There were two luggage racks provided which were all we needed. A small desk in the room with lamp and hanging space for clothes. There were also two decent sized drawers under the bed. There were more than enough electric sockets for all your gadgets and a hairdryer is provided in the bathroom. Towels were provided each day with 2 large and 1 small towel for each of us.The hotel offers free wifi which was great for us although even though the password remained the same had to log back into the wi-fi every day. Good connection and speed. The door to the bathroom was a sliding door (which left a slight gap down the side) and there was one clear window into the bathroom from the bedroom at head height. This basically means the person sharing your room with you can look in on you (and hear anything you're doing) while you use the toilet, ok for couples but not ideal for travelling friends. The bed was large and comfortable, it had 4 pillows in the room which cater to those who want them and those who don't. The bed was made with a single sheet and fleece blanket, no duvet. We didn't find this an issue in early December. There is a heater/air con unit under the window which kept us comfortably warm. Bedside tables were available with over bed lights which was handy with jet lag and strange sleeping times. Dimmer switches on the main room and bathroom meant that when one was awake and wanted to use the bathroom the light wouldn't wake the other up. Very handy, especially with jet lag sleeping patterns.The location is great with all the main attractions a short walking distance with two subway stations only two or three blocks away. Great for shopping and sightseeing. There are lots of restaurants in the area, we can recommend the Sukhumvit 51 (Thai) on E51st Street, The Smiths on E51st and 3rd Ave (USA/great breakfasts) and Dos Camionos (Mexican) on E51st and 3rd Ave. The hotel is between 45mins -1hr from JFK and the hotel offer a shuttle ($22/pp) or private car service ($55/pp) to the airport on departure Don't eat breakfast at The Pod if you can help it, it's limited and overpriced and only visit the bar during happy hour.

I was going to spend less than 12 hours in the place, so who cares?But all in, Pod 51 failed to deliver on 2 of the 3 basics in my book: a passable shower, a decent night's sleep, and a clean room. The room was incredibly hot, and there was no way of dialing down the heat in the old radiator. So I kept opening the window to let in some cool air, but being in NYC and on the 2nd floor, the noise from the street at night was an ongoing issue too. So all night long it was wake up sweaty, open window, get woken by street noise, close window; repeat. The shared bathrooms are not clearly marked - there's no distinction between a lavatory and a shower, and neither is marked very well, so you end up wandering around peering at doors, looking for one that says ""WC"", peering inside to see what it is. The shower, apart from being, y'know, a communal shower, is TINY. There's no room to even put down your towels, aside from the floor, which is really unpleasant. I'd tolerate ALL of this, though, if not for the fact that the tiny shower literally had nothing but FREEZING water. Not cold, ladies and gents - I've had a lukewarm shower before. Freezing. As in, during the dreadful experience known as Rinsing My Shampoo, my head actually hurt from how cold it was. No matter how long I waited, the water never warmed up, not an ounce, and I was in too deep at that point to retreat back and restart my day filthy, but otherwise unscathed. It may literally have been the worst shower of my life.The lobby is nice, the room definitely seemed clean, and the free drink at the adjacent bar is a nice touch, but ultimately my experience was an unpleasant one - I don't care how cool the lounge music is if I can't get any sleep and my shower felt like I was staying in a Siberian prison camp. The location is great and NYC is a terribly expensive city for hotels, so it's tempting to go for a budget-friendly option, but for what I paid (it's not THAT cheap), it wasn't worth it. Next time I'm in town, I'd rather splash out a tiny bit more for an experience that won't end up defined by a hellishly hot room and frigidly cold shower.","Charlotte, North Carolina",60,2.0

On arrival we were given vouchers for a free wine in the bar which was a nice touch - the bar itself was quite cool and a nice place to have a final drink before going to bed. on the second morning, there was no hot water whatsoever - I called downstairs to see what the problem was and was told by a woman (fairly rudely) that I should wait 10 mins.

They did, however, knock $25 dollars off our bill for the inconvenience, without us even mentioning it which was a very nice touch - so alls well that ended well - you can't help a boiler malfunctioning!OVerall, a really good, cheap place to stay in a great location.","London, United Kingdom",9,4.0

The rooms are small, but the location makes up for it as it's very handy and close to transport links, plus there are plenty of good cafés, restaurants and bars within walking distance (and the room size isn't really important if you're out exploring anyway). The space is optimised to ensure that you have everything you need. The shared facilities are clean and well-maintained, and we never had to wait for a shower (nor did we experience any shortage of hot water). We had plenty of towels of varying sizes, replaced every day. The bar adjoined to the hotel is good, with friendly staff. My only criticism would be that the housekeeping staff are rather noisy and have a tendency to stand outside rooms talking loudly fairly early in the morning, which isn't the nicest way to wake up. I realise that they have to do get their jobs done, but a little more consideration for hotel guests wouldn't go amiss. All in all though, a good hotel and I'd happily return and recommend to others.","Sheffield, United Kingdom",14,4.0

The outdoor patio both on the ground level and roof were fabulous and we enjoyed sitting up on the roof at night looking at the beautiful lights of NYC. The subway is a short walk from this hotel and there are many great restaurants in the immediate area. Coming to NYC for the first time I knew the rooms would be small as well as the bathrooms etc. We still found there was plenty of room here and were quite comfortable. We stayed in the room to sleep and shower then we were gone like the wind so the rooms were perfect for our needs. Love the little lights above the doors telling you when the bathrooms were free etc. Never had an issue with getting into a shower/bathroom or having to wait etc. The staff were friendly and helpful and we really found it made our stay in NYC a comfortable and was a fun place to call home.,"Winnipeg, Canada",36,5.0

Our first impression of the room was that it didn't look as nice as in the pictures. It has a slightly worn down look to it, especially details like the tv and the iPhone docking station. The room actually wasn't as small as I was prepared for it to be. We had som space on the floor to put our bags and we never really felt that we lived on top of each other. The beds were quite hard, but I like that so I slept well. One thing that can cause a problem is that the beds are really short. I'm only 170 cm and my toes were outside the end of the bed. So if you're a tall person, that might be uncomfortable.The showers were always very clean and rarely occupied. We loved the rain shower! The noises from the corridors were a bit disturbing, especially the sound of the bathroom door when it always closed with a bang. Overall, it's an ok hotel, but it's really good if you're on a budget. I think it will be hard to find a hotel with the same standard for the same price.

Just one street away (50th St), there is a Gyu Kaku. Checking in was a breeze, the whole process took less than 10 minutes. Staff were friendly and helpful. During checkout, the bell captain helped us to book a cab to the airport.Back to the rooms, I can understand why some people say that this is very small.

The room was clean enough, no dust or dirt. The price for a city hotel in NY is not bad. The staff were friendly and helpful, storing luggage and helping organise airport transport etc. There is a bar joined on downstairs. The roof terrace is pretty cool. You can contol your own heating via radiator. Room window opens. Ipod dock, TV in bed.now for the cons: Having to walk the hallway to use the toilet or shower. Our room door let light in from the hall (pretty big gap at the bottom). Not much sound proofing (outside city noise wasn't an issue, more the fact that it sounded like a backpacker hostel from interior noise, people in hallways and could even hear the music that was playing through speakers outside the elevators in the hallway from my room in the morning.

The room was small as pictures will show, but it was clean and had a sink with towels. The bathrooms were well placed on the floors, not a long walk down the hallway, more like one to two rooms down and they were very clean. You can only access the restroom and shower with your key card which I appreciated. The walls are thin, but people were generally respectful of that fact and kept quiet. There was a guest across our hall that was flying a remote control helicopter, but once we stepped into the hall inquiring about the noise, he apologized and stopped. It was odd considering it was 9pm, but we were grateful he understood that it was loud for other guests. The location was great, it was relatively close to Grand Central and the Empire State, if you don't mind walking. I think it was a 10-15 minute walk to the Empire State Building for us. There were plenty of restaurants, bars and mini marts down the street and around the corners. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a long stay, say more than 2 nights, because the rooms are tiny and as an American, I like to spread out for longer stays.

The above two lines are not from any hospitality advert, but from my own experience. I stayed here for 3 nights from 12th to 15th October 2014. NYC was my first destination on my US pleasure trip and I had the privilege of exploring Manhattan all by myself without my wife. I was here purely on a gourmet tour and to enjoy the city. Hotels in NYC generally are very steep compared to other places in the US for obvious reasons. Like all other Indians, I was skeptical at first to select an accomodation with a shared bathroom (stayed in a single pod with shared bathroom) since we are very different and particular in our bathroom habits. But reading the reviews on TripAdvisor made me select this place. I did arrive much earlier than expected and had requested for an early checkin much in advance, only if possible, but they are mostly always sold out and couldn't provide me the same, but, they were more than happy to store my luggage at their bell desk till checkin time. The room - was clean, spic and span, had a window but without a view - though that didn't concern me at all, was well stocked with towels of different sizes - and basically exactly as described in other reviews and pictures. The shared bathrooms - as described in other reviews - 4-5 on each floor with indicators in each room about occupancy. They was actually absolutely clean at all times of the day - take my word - this is from an Indian who gets his bathroom cleaned from a domestic help every single day. The bathrooms (I used two of them during my stay) were decent in terms of space), properly planned layouts and equipped with shampoo and shower gel dispensers. The shower was good and one of the bathrooms even had spa nozzles in the shower area. I used to shower twice a day and found them to be extremely comfortable.I didn't use the hotel's cafe for breakfast, but it seemed to be very neat. The reason I didn't use it is that on all three days I used to go for breakfast at Ess-a-Bagel which was just around the corner - as I'm very fond of Bagels. Apart from this everything was walkable from the hotel, and there for 2-3 pharmacys in the vicinity for picking up essentials like water and other stuff. I am really happy with my choice and will stay here again next even when I come again as a couple (can't be fortunate enough to travel alone everytime). This time I am surely happy to announce that TripAdvisor was the perfect companion for searching accommodation.","Mumbai, India",7,5.0

They allow us the illusion of control and promise us memories of what we never experienced. But tiny is not always wonderful. Tiny leaves something to be desired, for example, in hotel rooms. We discovered this through experimentation with Pod 51. The hotel advertises its attitude toward space in its name, which perfectly represents the enfolding embrace that its rooms provide their occupants. The lobby is open and trendily decorated with a series of screens behind reception filled with a looping series of images of peculiar fragments of New York--graffiti, subway tiles, picturesque industrial debris, lunch stands, urban animals. You have the sense that the elevator from the lobby to the guestroom floors transports you from New York to some high rise on Main Street in Disneyland--everything seems at 5/8th scale. Hallways are narrow with low ceilings. The guestroom doors made me feel as though I, like Alice in Wonderland, had begun to grow larger. The room reinforced that sensation. The bed, a double, and the metal chair were the only standard-size objects in it. Taking up the whole of one side of the room were a desk and a bed arranged longitudinally—for two people it means one is claustrophobically encased between the wall and one’s partner with no escape. On the other side of the room, in two and a half foot increments, lined up from the entrance to the back wall are a small closet, an airplane-scaled stainless steel sink, a narrow shower, and a tiny toilet stall. The closet and sink open to the room; the shower and toilet share a sliding door, providing privacy for one or the other, but not both. (Our door would always slide back to its original position, curtailing the shower, leaving the occupant of the toilet exposed. I assume this was an equipment malfunction and not a sardonically planned detail.) The space between the bed and the sequence of functional cubicles is about two feet. This is a space perfectly designed for small, slender folks. The only serious design flaw I encountered was the guestroom door closure system, which is the loudest that I have encountered in a hotel. Way into the night I listened to latches as my neighbors came and went. Otherwise our room was remarkably quiet for New York.The location is convenient. Service was efficient. When our petite-screen TV wouldn’t change channels, an engineer appeared immediately and changed the battery of our remote control. I requested a room as high as possible and remote from the elevator, and that desire was perfectly fulfilled. At check-in we were also given coupons for two free drinks -- marked as for beer or wine -- but when we presented them at the end of the meal, we were informed that to be valid, they had to be presented as orders were taken. The reception staff was curiously unapologetic, suggesting it was our fault for not knowing how food coupons worked, a true enough accusation. In all, our experiment with miniature hotel rooms was fun, but I doubt that it will be repeated.","Durham, North Carolina",23,3.0

You just can't fault them even though this is a very unique hotel.Check in was fast, pleasant and courteous. The room - not as tiny as some reviews suggest and more than big enough for the two of us. We had a queen room with private bathroom. The shared bathrooms looked fine but for the extra $ I was happy to have our private space.I would politely suggest that guests of large body proportions may have trouble here. Specifically using the toilet. It was at a slight angle with a wall corner intersecting with the seat. The Bathroom counter was only a few inches away on the other side so if you're a husky man or woman I honestly don;t think you'll fit. And if you're over 6 feet tall, the shower is a bot of an adventure. But it's a good price, it's clean (I stripped the bed and checked for bed bugs/evidence - all clear), it's friendly, it's a happening place downstairs, it's reasonably quiet considering you're in NYC, and I'd go back. We didn't have breakfast there as the food we had during happy hour was unimpressive.

The room was clean, had heat and air, window with shutters was able to open, sink with towels, shampoo, soap, hair dryer, open closet and shelf. The room is really small but it's really designed for the guest to drop their stuff off, sleep, shower and go. The bathrooms (4 on my floor) also small, include a sink, a toilet and a shower. Wear flip flops/shower shoes. The restrooms were always clean. The rooftop lounge was really nice and simple but it was a bit too chilly to stay long. There is a onsite cafe in the lobby but I didn't eat there. The concierge was nice and helpful as were the desk staff, cleaning staff and baggage staff. Check out was at noon. I was in town for a convention at the Javits Convention Center and still had a day of events I needed to attend but was not able to take my luggage with me.

They're also a little dark, but that's not a huge problem. Nice lobby area and a good selection available for breakfast at a good price.

I had emailed a couple of questions before I arrived and received prompt helpful responses and continued to find all staff friendly and helpful when I arrived. The location is great for such a budget friendly hotel, subway is a block away and about a 20/30 minute walk to Times Square depending on how quickly you want to get there! Make sure you get a street map, spend some time with a coffee nailing the grid system and you're off! Room is small but more than adequate, always clean and fresh towels every day. The shared bathrooms gave me pause before I booked but I went for it and delighted to say they were very clean and the indicator lights in the room meant you knew when they were free. Sadly other guests were not respectful of the shared space but that's not the hotel's fault! Plenty of nice places to eat locally and Treehaus was good value for a filling breakfast in the morning. Recommend using the bus tours, great for getting around but shop around as the prices and tours are not all equal value. If you're on a budget and want tickets for Broadway go to the theatre the day before if you can. Mid afternoon there were no queues and balcony seats for between 35 and 50$ Tckts booths are great but only sell discounted top price tickets so if you want to see more than one show it gets a bit pricey.

I stayed in a Full Pod room which was small and very compact but it was perfect for me, the bed was queen or double sized but I wouldn't want to share the room with another person just because there really isn't space.

However, this hotel made me realize that I have a split personality:) My thrifty, adventurous, younger me loved it. My middle-aged, creature comfort loving, wish-I-could-afford-staying-at-The Ritz side, struggled a bit with the inability to move around and spread out in my room. That side also didn't want to walk down the hallway in the middle of the night in my nightgown to use the bathroom. Logistics: our pod room was about as big as a walk-in closet. It was tidy and efficiently put together. The shared bathroom is operated by a key lock so it's private and safe and I also found the bathrooms tidy and efficient. The best part about the hotel for me was the fun and comfortable lounge, garden terrace and breakfast room. Coffee was great and the breakfast they offered was excellent (although not included in rate). Location is good for a Midtown visit with two Metro stations within 2 blocks. To wrap it up, although my creature comfort self had moments of discomfort; my frugal & adventurous self would absolutely do it again.

As a solo female travellor I felt very safe, as the area is within the business district of Midtown East. The hotel has numerous restaurants, bars and pubs surrounding it at $$ cost, frequented by busy business professionals. All food I ate locally was delicious.Check in was quick and I was able to go straight to my room, even though it was before 3pm (official check in time). I had read many reviews where people indicated the room to be excruciatingly small, so it was a pleasant suprise to find the room bigger than expected. The single room was compact, but once I stored my clothes and moved my suitcase aside there was more than enough room. I didn't feel claustrophobic. The single bed was comfortable and the shutters on the windows blocked the light sufficently. The desk & chair gives you some place else to sit other than the bed. As I opted for a shared bathroom, the corner sink is great. There were plenty of power points and a wall safe. My room was at the back of the building on the 14th floor. There was only one next door neighbour (supply cupboard on other side). This was great location to reduce street and hotel noise. The shared bathrooms were clean for the most part and the indicator panel in the room is a great idea (no queuing in the hall way). On the negative there isn't any place to put your belongings in the tiny bathroom and only one clothes hook. I used a plastic bag which I hung off the bathroom door handle. My tip is to wake up early to shower. That way you will be the first or second person to use the bathroom for the day, or shower right after the cleaner has been through. Also remember to wash your hands again in your room as the bathrooms do not have paper towels or hand dryers.The service level was fine. Not super friendly, but cordial enough and helpful when asked. The air conditioning in the room is noisy, however this didn't really intrude on my sleep as it was a constant hum. It was my inconsiderate neighbours yelling, talking loudly in the hallway and slamming doors at all hours that woke me up and kept me awake on a couple of occasions.The kiosk in the lobby serves a reasonable priced breakfast and happy drinks and snacks each day. The hotel is located minutes away from the 6, E and M trains and about 10 minutes to Grand Central Station. Times Square was about 15 minute walk.If I was to stay again, I would consider paying the extra for a private bathroom or staying at the newer Pod 39. ","Melbourne, Australia",16,4.0

The room has a single bed, a small TV, a sink, hairdryer, towels, small hanging area with clothing hooks, safe and a tiny desk with an ipod docking station (bring your adaptor for iPhone 5, these are the original iphone charging docking stations).Check-in is at 3 pm, check-out at noon- they will put your bags away securely upon arrival/departure if you need time to explore outside between room check-in and your flight home.Yes, they are small rooms- perhaps the name of the hotel should give you a hint? I had absolutely no problem with the size of the room. Considering I was only there for sleep, I did not need anything else- it's the perfect place to crash midtown while you are on a short getaway. The staff was friendly, particularly the baggage room attendants. They were perfect gentlemen, polite, provided helpful service and always offered a warm smile upon arrival at the hotel.The room was clean, the towels were replaced daily and housekeeping made the bed and cleaned every morning. TThe bathroom indicator lights are helpful but to be honest, I did not have to wait for a bathroom once- there were four bathrooms on my floor and I never saw more than two lights on.I think that whenever you travel, research is required- I saw the reviews for Pod 51 and knew exactly what to expect. For those travellers giving negative reviews because of the room size, comfort levels, locations, etc.- perhaps next time, you should do some research before booking? The Pod does not hide the fact that it has small rooms.Lexington Avenue shops are only a couple of blocks away for the shoppers. Times Square, Rockerfeller Centre, Radio City Music Hall and Broadway are about a 10-15 min walk. Grand Central Station is also about an 8 minute walk from the hotel. There are subway stations a couple of blocks from the hotel- 51st street for the 6 train, 53rd street for the E train. As a female traveller on my own, I always felt safe, comfortable and well attended. I dined at the French restaurant next door one night, the Bateau Ivre and it was absolutely lovely- delicious food, amazing wine, and a very cozy atmosphere. It is also open until 4 am daily, so late dinners here are very convenient as it is literally next door to the hotel lobby!My room faced the courtyard so I did not hear street noise at night that was disturbing. Yes, you can hear doors open and close if they are slammed- the washroom doors slam if you do not shut them quietly at night. But it's nothing to ""keep you up all night""- i had no trouble sleeping at all. I don't think that part of 51st street is that loud at night to begin with, so I'm not sure why there are comments complaining about street noise. You are in Midtown Manhattan, there might be some noise, but this is expected!!My bed was comfortable. Was it a King sized oasis in a 5 star hotel? NO- because that is not what I paid for!!! I was perfectly fine with my bed. However, male travellers beware of the single pods as they may not be comfortable beds if you are taller than 5'11.

Friendly concierge, and free walking tours available. The front desk staff is very attentive and helpful.This is a budget hotel. The rooms are very small, but definitely comfortable. I stayed in a single pod room with a shared bathroom. My biggest concern was the ""shared bathroom."" They are spotlessly clean. Marble baths with stainless steal fixtures. All have rain shower heads, but Each one is different, so try them all. They are a little warm. Ventilation could be better. In the room you have a tiny sink, towels, soap, shampoo, lotion, hair dryer, small area to hang clothes and stow your luggage. Beds are comfy but single pods only come with one pillow so ask for another one. I did and had it delivered in minutes.Bottom line: EXCELLENT.

Unfortunately, the room (320) was on the back of the building and its window was just above the air conditionning units below. As this was a very hot and muggy week in NYC, the noise from the AC units was an annoyance at night. Perhaps a room on a higher floor would be quieter. A room on the street side might also be acceptable as the E 51st Street isn't very busy at night in these parts of Manhattan.Besides the noise issue and a slight smell of humidity in the hallways (remember: it was a very hot week), this hotel remains a good choice in this pricey city. Rooms and amenities are spotless, staff is welcoming and the common areas (rooftop, garden, PoP bar) are very cosy. For the very impatient travellers, the waiting time for the elevators might be an aggravation. The location is great as it is walking distance from Times Square and Grand Central (15/20m) and there are some metro stations around.Several people mentionned in their comments that this place was more of a guesthouse/youth hostel than a 'real' hotel.

Yes the rooms are small, but they provide everything you need including a comfy bed and air conditioning after a long day taking in the endless sights the city has to offer. The room was clean and compact and included everything we needed for our stay including toiletries, a hairdryer and towels which were changed every day during our stay. The hotel is in close proximity to bars, restaurants and cafes and within walking distance to the subway. That said, the hotel is quiet with relaxed vibe which is a welcome change from a hectic day walking around the hustle and bustle of the city.The hotel has a lot of great features including an outside seating area just off the lobby, and a roof terrace with stunning views of the surrounding area and streets below. We grabbed a pizza from a nearby take away and wolfed it down up on the terrace which made a great change to the somewhat expensive nearby restaurants.A couple of handy tips… Be sure to take insect repellent. Mosquitos went to town on me during the hot weather, something I hadn't anticipated or prepared for. UK hair straighteners don't work here (or at least mine didn't) due to the difference in voltage.

This hotel was great, and I'd be delighted to stay here again, but it's a bit too pricey for my budget as a grad student ($130-190 a night, depending on day of the week, for a single room with shared bath).All of the staff I dealt with were helpful and pleasant. When I arrived, I was told there was ""a problem"" with my reservation, but they resolved whatever it was in about 5 minutes. They allow you to pay in cash at check-in, with just a $20 deposit, which was extremely convenient since I was between credit cards at the time.The neighborhood is excellent. There's a police precinct on the next block, and I felt safe walking around at all hours. There are multiple options for food and shopping within a few minutes' walk. Most of the restaurants on the block are nicer sit-down places, but there's a cheap Chinese takeout place and a few delis if you walk down 2nd Avenue. There's also a 24-hour drugstore 2 blocks away.My room was small but immaculate. I was pleasantly surprised to find it had a small sink, which was not mentioned on the website when I booked. They also provided towels and a bath mat (all replaced daily), and a few small toiletries. The bed was extremely comfortable, but just had sheets and a blanket - I would have liked a duvet or something a little heavier, but that's a minor complaint. The air conditioning worked very well, and cooled the space quickly. It was a little to loud to leave on all night, though, and the room felt stuffy when I woke up in the morning. I turned the a/c back on when I left for the bathroom, and the temperature was perfect again when I returned 5 minutes later. The wireless internet worked without any problems.The bathrooms were also kept very clean. There were 4 bathrooms with showers shared by my floor, and I only had to wait once (first thing in the morning). The bathrooms varied greatly in size, and at least one of them had no hooks or towel bar - so some were definitely better for showers than others. There were soap and shampoo dispensers in each shower, and the water temperature was easy to adjust. I have a few very minor complaints about the bathroom setup: first, I wish there were some toilet-only bathrooms. At one point, all 4 were occupied by people taking showers, so there was a bit of a wait. I didn't try my keycard at a bathroom on another floor, so I'm not sure if that is an option. There were no towels or hand dryers in the bathrooms, which was fine if you remembered to bring a towel, but inconvenient if you wanted to visit the bathroom on your way in or out. Lastly, there were no full-length mirrors in either the bathrooms or the bedrooms.My only real complaint about this hotel is that it's loud - both literally and figuratively. The lobby, elevators, and hallways are painted with bright, somewhat jarring patterns, and there is usually music playing in the public spaces. I could hear the hallway music from inside my room with the door closed, but it was turned off at night and didn't interfere with sleeping. There was some noise in the hallways from people passing by, and I imagine this would be even worse on weekends when the hotel is fully booked. The lobby has outlets, internet, and a small cafe, and would be a delightful place to work if the music weren't so distracting. All in all, I'd be happy to stay here again, but it probably won't be my first choice. It's certainly more convenient and reliable than Airbnb, but significantly more expensive (especially if you're willing to consider rooms outside of midtown). I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great location and consistent quality but unwilling to pay typical Manhattan hotel costs.","Hanover, New Hampshire",8,4.0

The bathrooms, whilst communal, were perfectly well appointed and mostly tidy (when they weren't it was more to do with with our fellow guests - and on that subject, is it really difficult to flush a toilet after you've used it?)The only complaint that we'd have is that the wifi service struggled to make it to our room at the end of a corridor on the sixth floor.

The room safe didn't work, I didn't raise it as an issue because I had nothing to steal anyway, the room was cleaned/tidied nicely and daily.A/C excellent, a nice cool room on arrival, check in was pretty fast, I emailed ahead and advised I would be late due to my flight being delayed, got good advise from the team about getting to the hotel from JFK at that time of night.The room had a sink but no toilet so I was using the communal bathrooms in the hallway, I was on 14 (no 13) and the shared facilities here were clean and tidy and perfectly good.Bed was ok, I slept on it but they weren't the most comfortable sleeps I ever had.The shared facilities are easily locked from the inside for privacy and can only be opened from the outside with a keycard. That's probably my main gripe with the POD, very easy to lock yourself out of your room after a few beers ,,,My room had a narrow view of the city.Outside there's a good few pubs, restaurants and it's easy to get anywhere in Manhattan from here.I'd stay here again if it was myself, or with friends.

We wanted to see the city and were on a budget and we could not have found a more perfect hotel for that! We chose Pod 51 over Pod 39 because the prices were a little cheaper. Pod 51 is in a GREAT location. We walked everywhere we needed to go and if it was far we'd take the subway. We stayed in a twin bunk room (again, on a budget) which was totally fine. The shared bathrooms were always clean and one was always available. We had a sink in our room so all we needed to use the shared bathrooms for were showering and using the toilet. We went out and got lunch one day and brought it back to eat on their rooftop deck- AMAZING views of the city! Everyone was very nice and helpful who we ran into working at the hotel. This is a great hotel if you're looking to just use it to sleep. If you were going to spend any time in your hotel room, I would reccomend something with a little more room as it was pretty cramped.

We were expecting the tiny room so we were not shocked by that and we also knew about the ""semi-private"" bathrooms as they are only separated from the room by a glass door. Make sure you are comfortable with the person you are travelling with or else you're in for a few surprises. We travelled as a couple so this was not an issue for us. We stayed in the queen room and as I said, it was small, but it was exactly what we needed for this trip. The hotel is close to everything we wanted to see, so we walked everywhere (including to the far end of Central Park) and saved ourselves from having to learn the subway system or taking cabs. Christmas season had begun in NYC, so we were able to quickly stroll to 5th Ave and check out all of the store front displays and even see the Rockafeller Tree (simple amazing for a Christmas junkie like myself). This hotel is worth it simply based on location. We didn't need anything fancy - we were hardly in the room and out exploring most of the time! We also didn't have any problems with noise or service while we were there. We ate at the restaurant attached once as a quick break from walking around and the food was tasty and filled us up!One perk to keep in mind if you are going to the airport is that they have a car service available to take you there - ours was about 40$ which was the same as the cab we paid for to get there and this comes with the added bonus of being able to reserve your time!We will definitely look into staying here again when we travel back to NYC.","Pembroke, Canada",7,4.0

We booked a double room - next time I think I would book a queen room as the bed was sideways to the wall - not that this was a problem - not unless you were against the wall that is!! To be honest, the amount of time you are in your room I think its a waste of money (nice, but a waste) to have a big fancy room that you only spend a fraction of your time in - especially. Nice clean and tidy room. The sink was in the room - absolutely fine - and the shower room (which was separate!) was plenty big enough with a nice powerful shower. TV, free WiFi, safe, hairdryer etc - shame no tea/coffee facilities. There are options to share bathrooms - obviously this will make your room rate cheaper - but gone are the days of sharing - except for with my husband that is ;). The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. I must say the location of this hotel is the key - midtown and just a few blocks from 5th Avenue - once there go one way for Times Square and the other for the Empire State Building (highly recommended - even though I don't like heights - you can't go to NYC and not go up there - views to die for!!). Nice diner around the corner one way for breakfast and really good Italian around the other.

Theres is about 6 chairs to eat your croissant and drink coffee in the morning.The hallways are very dark, could do with more lighting.The lifts are awful. I once waited 5 mins, just to go down 1 floor. I know you're wondering, why didn't i take the stairs? Well i would have loved to, however there's a sign on the door to the stair case stating guest should not use the stair case unless there's an emergency. The hotel needs to invest in new lifts!One of the nights i stayed I was awoken, in the early hours of the morning by other guests shouting, swearing and banging on doors. Not what i expect to happen in a hotel. Especially when i've spent $400+.On the 2nd floor there is just a toilet with no sink. Guests are unable to wash their hands, after doing God knows what. Which makes me wonder how clean the 2nd floor really is. (Think: door handles, light switches, guest cards to get into the bathrooms) A suggestion: the hotel should invest in automatic lighting. Instead of light switches in the bathroom, where guests have to touch.Overall, hotel was ok. Below average. I would not recommend it and will not be staying there again",London,1,3.0

But my son found the instructions on the door where it explained where to put our things. Turns out that everything fit perfect. We emptied our two big suitcases and found space to put them away. The small zink had a little stopper that was nicely designed and worked better than those things ever do. I needed to soak some clothes, and I could without any water leaking out. The architect had really thought of everything. I've stayed in much bigger hotel rooms where I couldn't soak clothes or couldn't find enough hangers, or a hook for my toiletries. The room was cleaned very well every day. The only thing I have to complain about is that the wi-fi came and went.

We had our own shower and toilets in the room. The air conditionning is greatly apreciable.

For the last day, very good luggage service (the man helped us get cash back since we had a problem with our French credit cards). In a word, I would go there again and recommend it !! ps : the only -slightly- negative point is the fact that the nearest subway is 51st street, which is not far, but which is not an express stop, so at nights, you have to stop at 53rd lex av or 59th st.

I was a little apprehensive before booking, as a previously-booked airbnb apartment was cancelled last minute, leaving me scrambling for a place to stay. The Pod exceeded my expectations! Pros: Location - yes, there are more central areas to stay in NYC and hipper, more happening neighborhoods. However, this spot (near the UN) is only a few blocks from 5th Avenue shopping, Grand Central, lots of sushi restaurants, and several subway stations. We walked to Times Square and Central Park- both longer hikes, but certainly nothing strenuous and lots to see on the quick 15 minute walks. Value for money - we stayed in a room with a queen bed and a private bathroom. While this hotel is very upfront about the economic room sizes, the queen room is PLENTY of space for two people, as long as you don't mind being very close the whole time in the room! We were on out way back to Uganda for work, so we had a total of four giant suitcases, two carryons, a backpack, etc. There was plenty of room to store our bags and the hanging rod, drawers under the bed, and side tables had plenty of room for the things we needed. I can't speak to the size of other rooms, but this was perfect for the two of us. We could have upgraded to a bigger hotel for $100 or $200 more, but we would rather spend that money on nice dinners than a room we didn't spend much time in anyway! Ambiance - the hotel is warm, inviting, and modernly furnished. The lobby was under renovation while we were there, but the temporary space located in the Pop@Pod restaurant underneath works fine for the time being. The room was clean and pretty. There is also rooftop access on the 14th floor with nice lounge chairs and tables if you're coming in the summertime. Cons: Internet - the intermittent wifi service (kicked us off after five minutes, if it could connect at all) could have been due to the renovations I mentioned earlier, but it was the biggest frustration of our trip. Not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but this is 2014 and reliable wifi access is not a difficult service to provide, renovation or no renovation. If this is a dealbreaker for you, this may not be your first choice of lodging. Proximity to nightlife - take this with a grain of salt. If you are looking to be right outside the door of booming nightclubs and an all-night party scene, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a great location for sightseeing and getting to main attractions, but it tends to be in more of a financial/business/shopping/tourist area and is pretty peaceful after midnight. However, this is ONLY a con for you if proximity to clubs and bars is your very top priority. I almost hesitate to mention it, as I don't want to sound like it is a tired, empty place - because it isn't! It was actually pretty nice to have a quiet, relaxing place to come after a long day of walking (and eating too much of NY's endless food, to be perfectly honest).

Hair dryer, luggage rack and clothes hangers provided, and there's a small safe for valuables in the room. I expected very minimal if any amenities, so it seemed more than adequate to me. Be careful not to drop any small items near the little airplane-style sink if the drain isn't completely shut or they will go straight down! I did not experience a noise problem from inside or out other than the vacuum cleaner in the hall, and that was during reasonable hours. Only subtraction in my rating is because I had to report twice that my room thermostat wasn't working and it was a little too warm, but following the second time it was fixed promptly. Excellent location for walking and easy walk to subway. From LaGuardia I took the Q70 bus to the Jackson Heights subway station and the E train to the Lexington/53rd stop and it's about a 4 1/2 block walk to Pod 51.

My sister-in-law recommended Pod 51, so we booked it, although the bunk room in the photo did not match the bunk room we were given. The room is approximately seven feet wide and 12 feet deep, with a small sink and mirror available, as well as a small desk. The beds were twins and were also small, but tolerable and reasonably comfortable, each with their own TV. We were on the second floor in 230 and weren't bothered by street noise or bar noise that others had complained about. The big catch (and there's always a catch when you pay $200 for a room in Manhattan when all the other hotels you were looking at were about $100 more) is the communal bathrooms. Not a big deal for us, since we were going to be spending the next few nights in similar (although far more spacious) accommodations on a college campus. Not all four of the bathrooms on the floor had showers and one of the toilet-only bathrooms didn't have a sink, which means you have to walk back to your room to wash your hands if the other bathrooms are in use. I'm not sure how the city health code allows such an arrangement, but you realize the possibilities when you stare down that door handle and know you can't wash your hands before using it (and no one else could either).The communal bathrooms are also very tiny, although it didn't seem like this was entirely necessary. If you are 6'0 or taller, you'll be ducking in the shower. There isn't much room to dry off and water will get everywhere on the floor, so bring some shower sandals, just to be safe.The hotel is convenient to public transit, restaurants and popular sight-seeing destinations, which we appreciated and we really only spent a few hours there sleeping, which is all we typically do in larger hotel rooms.Some of the bathrooms did have a bit of an odor to them and it would be nice if the fans in them stayed on all the time.","Racine, Wisconsin",13,3.0

We stayed for five days and to be honest we were out from first thing in the morning to very late evening so the pod was an ideal base for sleeping and showering.

The soap holder in the shower and the toilet paper holder are not attached to the wall properly and are ready to fall off the wall. The soap and shampoo bottles kept sliding down to the floor cause the holder is too big, They either need to give bigger soap and bottle of shampoo or change the soap holder. The tiny desk is very unstable and shakes when you lean on one side. The metal chair is very uncomfortable to sit on (very cold) and if you sit on it for a long time will leave an impression on your skin. You have to put a towel on it or pillow before you sit on it.

Yes, it's close to 5th, Times Square, MoMa, Empire and so on (this was what made me overlook the fact that the rooms very probably not going to be super spacious, when I booked), but it really, really wasn't worth it.

I've read reviews where people have complained about the rooms being small - it's true that the rooms are small, but if you're going to complain about that then you either need to up your budget or you're in NYC for the wrong reasons. I don't travel to sit in my hotel room so it was no problem for me, I guess if you're a couple it could be a bit cozy but again, you're there to see NY not sit in your hotel. The shared bathrooms were very clean, and there is a panel in your room that lights up to tell you which ones are vacant so you don't get caught short in your towel or whatever. The staff were all very helpful, and I had a bit of an issue with my payments (as I had two separate bookings) and while I felt like I was being a pain, the staff never made me feel like one! The little cafe on site is also nice and the roof deck is such a cool place to sit, I only discovered it on my last night, wish I'd found it sooner! If you stay here please take advantage of the free walking tours that run every Tues, Thurs and Fri. They are amazing! Another great thing about Pod51 is the location, it's super close to subways, and all the busiest aves (Lexington, 5th, Madison), not far from Central Park and also one block up is a police station so you always feel pretty safe when heading back to the hotel at night. One very minor criticism is that the street below can be a bit noisy at night, nothing a pair of earplugs can't fix. Though the only time I thought it was noisy was on Friday night but that's understandable. Didn't stop me sleeping though!

I will do my best to describe my full experience. First of all the location was great , subway stop nearby (although I didn't use the subway at all), restaurants and bars as well. Many people had an issue with the employees at the front desk, but I found them to be very friendly and helpful when I asked for directions. Second, I was assuming I was going to walk in to a dorm room. It was not at all like that. I was traveling solo and the single room/ w shared bathroom was amazing. I read reviews that stated when the luggage was out there was no space to walk in the room, and that was definitely not the case with me. I had enough space to lay out 8 days worth of clothing and my work materials. Now last but not least, the shared bathroom, this is the first time I share a bathroom with just about anyone, I was more than extremely skeptical to share a bathroom with a stranger, and it was not at all a problem. There was always one available, there were 2 on my floor, the bathroom were always cleaned, and space wise they were perfect enough to lay out all my bathing creams. Over all the hotel was great ! I would definitely stay here again, the price was the best I could get in this area, and everyone was extremely helpful !","Miami Springs, Florida",8,5.0

We had a queen pod with a bathroom in the room. The good thing about the small rooms at the hotel is that even though there can be kind of a young crowd, the rooms don't lend themselves to partying or hanging out, so this type of noise is minimized. The negatives are that - as other reviewers have noted - the rooms with bathrooms included are grouped together with the rooms that share bathrooms. So no matter where you are, you hear doors slamming at all hours of the day and night. Even our white noise machine cranked up at full volume could not drown it out. All that would need to be done to fix this would be to install the anti-slamming devices in the doors. It's enough to make me not want to stay there again. Also, just as a side note - we tipped housekeeping $3 each day, but weirdly never got a new bar of soap in three days. One day, the housekeeper opened the window a couple of inches, then closed the shutters. Because we returned from sightseeing after dark, we had no way of knowing that the window had been opened until the next morning when the dishes and silverware clanking and crashing from the cafe outside woke us up at 6am. A minor aggravation, but still. I would recommend this hotel with the warning of the door slamming noise. Also if you need something specific, I guess leave a note with your tip for housekeeping - in retrospect, that's what I should have done.","New Orleans, Louisiana",185,4.0

It is not my favourite part of town, but there are plenty of restaurants and bars, and its a better area than the large hotels near Time Square (which is full of tourist traps). I like this hotel because it is clean, you get a good sleep, the price is good, and the lobby has great breakfast, snacks, drinks and coffee along with the wireless. If you are alone, its a great place to meet and chat with other travellers, which is frequented by Europeans and Latin Americans. On the negative side, the rooms are small. With a couple it would feel pretty tight (i've always been alone). The bathrooms unnecessarily have windows with no shades in the shower and toilet to the room, and the sink is very small. NOTE: this hotel is frequently fully booked, and there are not lots of rooms. This means if you arrive on an early flight from Europe or the Middle East (many arrive at 5-6 am), you can be stuck with no early check in options until noon or later. While this is not the hotel's fault, a larger hotel would have a better chance of having rooms available for early check in. The staff do their best on this but there are limited options if it is full. The other negative is noise from the hallways can be intrusive -- especially since many rooms have bathrooms/showers in the hall instead of in the room, for a lower price, but it means more hall traffic.","Rome, Italy",56,3.0

We were pleased to get an early checkin at 11am. Because I had the right expectations going in, the size of the room was fine (maybe a little stuffy). The bunk beds were comfortable and fun. Storage areas and in-room sink were great. Outdoor garden area, breakfast/happy area cafe, and rooftop garden were all excellent. The location was great -- it was my first time in NYC where I didn't stay in Times Square and it was very nice to come back to a quieter street. The indicator lights of when the shared bathrooms were occupied was perfect, and I never felt like they were all busy at the same time, even in the morning.The thing that made me give this a 3 instead of a 5 were the bathrooms themselves. When we arrived at 11am on a Friday, the bathrooms were reasonable clean. I was glad to read another reviewer say to bring a hand towel, because it was awkward not to have one when you're dealing with wet hands and a room key. But when we came back to the room for a bit around 5pm, the bathrooms were a little nasty ... obviously a dried urine spray on the seat and drips around the base of the toilet. Tried two bathrooms and they were the same. The rest of the weekend, it wasn't quite as bad as it had been that first day, but I was already grossed out.The other issue was it was very tiring to be out and about in the city all day and not just be able to come back to one's room and feel like you had some privacy. Instead, you could relax for a bit, but then every time you needed to use the toilet or shower, you had to make yourself presentable to walk the halls, have shoes on, have your key ready, schlep your stuff down, then put toilet paper on the seat before you could sit. I knew this was part of the deal when I booked the room, but not having a true respite each evening kept me from fully recharging my batteries for another busy day sightseeing. I don't think the cost savings was enough that I'd do it again in the future. If I could get an affordable room with a bathroom at Pod 51, I would probably stay there again.",Kansas City,8,3.0

The room was very clean and in good condition as was the rest of the hotel. We didn't have contact with many of the staff but those that we did speak to were polite and helpful.

We never had to wait long for a free bathroom and we only did wait because we were fussy with which one we wanted as they were all different sizes. The bathrooms were cleaned regularly and only saw one cockroach/water bug. Towels are provided in the rooms but they are the size of tea towels so I would recommend to bring one with you. Never had a problem with the wi-fi, it was easy to connect and fast.

Check in was quick and easy and they give you a ticket for a free drink in the bar/restaurant next door at check in.

Our small window did not look out onto anything but the shutters kept out anyone looking in. There is a small desk in the room and a sink with glasses provided. In looking back I am glad we were down the hall and away from the bathrooms because when I had to make a visit at 3am I was worried that I was making too much noise for those rooms right across. Might be convenient for them but I think the closing of the doors all night would keep my awake. The bathrooms were always available when we needed them - they were clean, showers appeared clean but after using the bathroom right after someone showered I have to say they were very humid and muggy. Size of rooms in NYC are very small and this is certainly no exception but it is functional and the beds were comfortable so no complaints from me.

I was happy with the price ($169 a night plus taxes) and the Midtown location. And I liked it well enough that I would stay there again.Yet I would hesitate to recommend it to others given its tiny space. It wasn’t a room to which you would want to go back, put up your feet, and comfortably read a good book or watch television (there is a 13-inch television on the wall, however).I had a single, twin-bed room. I looked in one double room, where the double bed (note: not a queen) was against the wall, creating some inconvenience for an “inside” guest wanting to get up in the night. An online review mentioned this, said the hotel moved them to a different room where this wasn’t an issue.The place has a European feel, and in fact many guests are Europeans and Asians. Here are principal things I liked about the hotel.• Block and a half from the subway station for the north-south 6 train, and a short underground walk to an east-west train.• Safe neighborhood, with the NYPD 17th Precinct station in the next block and a seemingly unnecessary 24/7 NYPD presence on the Pod 51 block. Among neighbors on the block: several restaurants, a synagogue with outdoor seating area, two foreign-government offices, a small school.• In all respects the hotel seems modern and well-maintained.• Good twin-size bed, good shower, thirsty towels (I chose the bathroom-down-the-hall option), free WiFi, in-room sink, daily housekeeping, good bedside reading light, standard heat/AC with a window that opens, complementary USA Today, concierge in lobby.• Although I had the obligatory loud neighbors and slamming doors, I was never bothered by noise when I was in the room.• Three humongous drawers under the bed, plus a small table, a desk and chair, and a folding luggage rack; clothes bar with six hangers.• Building has 14 floors (no 13th), and a rooftop with Adirondack chairs.• Half-block away Treehaus restaurant (buffet lines and order-at-counter options) and a block over on Lexington a bakery and grocery/deli.","Salem, Oregon",28,5.0

We stayed for 4 nights in a Bunk Pod in the Pod hotel on 51st Street. I’m not usually a big fan of shared bathrooms but in this hotel it did not bother me. First of all, the bathrooms seems to be cleaned quite often, there are plenty and there’s a clever system in the room showing which one is free. The room is very tiny as many already wrote. However there was space enough to leave both our suitcases open. I’ve seen different before in so-called executive rooms. The Bunk bed comes with two TVs and two reading lights. Perfect solution if you want to share a room with a friend.The hotel has a roof terrace which seems to be nice but which we simply forgot to visit. It will give us a reason to come back.When checking in, we got two coupons to get a glass of wine for free in the Pop@Pod bar next door. That’s a nice treat but I would advice to be a bit more flexible in the choice of free drinks: we asked for a diet coke instead of the glass of wine and the waitress told this was not possible. Quite odd and annoying so we left after the first drink.We did not take breakfast in the hotel as we found better choices nearby. Being Belgian, I can recommend Le Pain Quotidien just around the corner at 2nd Avenue, between 49th & 50th street.In summary, for my next trips to New York, I will definitely stay in one of the POD hotels!","Antwerp, Belgium",70,5.0

Yes we're a couple, yes we deliberately booked a bunk pod. New York was not the only destination of our trip so to keep costs down we decided we could cope with sleeping in bunk beds for 4 nights. If I'm honest, best decision we made! The beds were really comfy and twin size so we slept very well! We were on the 2nd floor at the back so the room was fairly quiet. Room was bigger than I thought after reading some reviews, there was enough space for both our cases and the sink in the room was small but useful.There were 4 shared bathrooms on the floor, 2 toilet/shower, 1 just toilet and 1 just shower. We found that bathroom 1 had more floor space but the shower in bathroom 2 was taller so better for my other half. The bathrooms were always clean and there was always hot water. The panel above the door in the bedroom was great so we didn't have to hang around in the corridor. There was only 1 morning were we had to wait to get to the bathroom but other than that we had no problems with availability.Pop at Pod, the attached bar/restaurant served great food and had a great atmosphere. We ended up here every night after spending the day walking round the city. I had a cocktail called the dirty flower that was great! The barmaid (whose name I never got) was lovely and really friendly. There must have been a organised event the one night because it was very busy but this only added to the atmosphere.Location wise, the pod was close to most of the main tourist attractions (Top of the Rock and 5th Ave were about a 15min walk. Times Square and the Empire State building about 20mins). We walked everywhere and found that once we got to know where things were it really wasn't that far.

We paid for a 'double' for four nights. Never in my life have I come across a room whereby the bed is set out parallel to the room wall. This meant that my husband could not get out his side and would have to climb over me to get out the bed. I can see why the hotel do this - to get maximum rooms out of minimal space. They do not show this on the website so I was not expecting this. I went down to the reception to ask if we could change rooms to a double that was configured more normally and they told me that would incur an upgrade to a queen. This was only $20 a night and as I was so unhappy, we went for it but I think it's very disingenuous not to show this on the website - indeed I have just checked the website and they even show the pillows set out as a normal double bed, not laid out to the side. This was not a good start to the holiday. Please note these rooms are known as a FULL POD and they are tiny; there is not even a room enough for two large suitcases standing upright. The bathroom is also tiny which did not bother me but the sink size is minuscule - if you want to wash your face you need to contort your head into a strange position to avoid the tap! The upgrade to the Queen was a lot better - bigger bed configured properly and more room generally. The decor is simple and relatively contemporary but if I'm being brutally honest only marginally better than a Premier Inn (a decent budget hotel in England for those of you who are not British!). On the plus side, the bed themselves are very comfortable and the bed linen was of good quality. The service and concierge is good and the location of the hotel is amazing - I guess that's what you're really paying for. 5 mins from Park Avenue and 10/15 min walk to all the major sites in Midtown - Rockafeller, Chrysler, Grand Central etc. If you're looking for a budget hotel and are aware of the size of the rooms, then this will be a good choice. If you're looking for a little bit of luxury or romance then no, pay a little extra and choose somewhere else!","London, United Kingdom",17,3.0

Fell in love with the litte garden cafe area on the first floor, the wall art was bright and funky with a lot of greenery.

From the hotel I walked to the Met, Central Park, Greenwich Village, Times Square (I know some of them are far but there really is no better way to see the city) The Crysler Building was just a few blocks away and made for beautiful night scenery when walking back to the hotel.

Arrived on Friday afternoon, a little early, and when I hit the curb and tried to go in by what I discovered was the ""Pad@Pod"" door, not the front door, I was snapped at by the surly doorman.My room WAS ready for me, which was a plus, and it was very clean but very, very small. The bed was double but was arranged in such a way that there was no headboard, so to watch TV you had to either prop yourself up between a ledge running the length of the bed against the wall and the edge of the tiny desk that was up against the top of part of the bed. The TV was inexplicably mounted against a wall that was catty-wampus toward the bed.The hairdryer was lackluster until I pulled the back off and discovered the air intake almost smothered in white fuzz. Fixed that.No in-room coffeemaker. No washclothes. No complimentary coffee in the mornings. No workout room.My last morning there I tried to take a shower and couldn't get any hot water, just something lukewarm. It was 38 degrees outside and I just wasn't in the mood to attempt a shower in water that was about twice that warm. Ended up attempting a sitz bath with a cup and some soap.Honestly, for what I paid for three nights I could have had all the amenities AND a charming doorman. Final insult was when I checked out and the bellman told me that he could get me a limo instead of a cab for $55.00. Turned out that the limo really didn't want to take a credit card and charged me an extra $5.00 for the privilege.On the plus side, it was very convenient to everywhere if you like to walk and like to see the city ""boots on the ground.""

The rooms are, well, pod-like. Very small. Some have shared bathrooms. But they are well designed: they have drawers under the beds and other space-saving devices. I only had two concerns. First, the sink was so small that when I washed my face or shaved I sprayed water everywhere. Second, I was on the second floor looking into some sort of space between a bunch of buildings. There was an industrial fan in that space that was very loud. I sleep with ear plugs so it didn't keep me awake, but it might disturb some other people.

Although our room was tiny we did not mind that so much at we were in New York and that is expected but the whole week we were there we had terrible experiences with the staff. Upon our arrival they did not even tell us which room we were in or offer to show us to the room they just took the money and gave us some paper with the room number and our keys on it. We were left to find the room for ourselves. Although the check-in was pretty straight forward and we did not think much of it only that the attitude was a bit stand offish and maybe that is how they do it here. However a few days later we were sitting in the reception and saw another couple being checked-in by the same man who checked us in. The man was acting extremely helpful and kind to this couple, saying things like: ""I hope you found us okay, and you had a good trip here"", ""here are some free drink vouchers for the bar next door, oh and here is a voucher to receive discounts on meals at the bar"" ""I hope you have a wonderful stay with us"" ""You can take the elevator straight up to your room"". We found this even more disturbing as we had previously assumed this was just the way the staff were but not it appears only we were coping all the rudeness. On our last day we had been out all day and it had been raining our coats were completely soaking and we asked is there somewhere we can hang these because we had checked out of our room and still had hours before our bus. The man at the counter said no we do not offer services like that. So we had no way of drying out jackets. On another occasion we asked a lady at the counter if the hotel offered laundry services or she knew somewhere we could do laundry. The answer there might be a place a few blocks away, but sorry other than that I can not help you. When we spoke with the tourist information person next to the front counter of the hotel and asked him where he recommenced we go in Brooklyn he would not look at us and gave us a map of Manhattan and then said Dumbo is good and then did not tell us how to get there. Overall this is not a terrible hotel facilities wise but our experience just shows how the staff in a hotel can ruin the whole place for you. We hated going back there every night as it felt like we were not even welcome when we were paying just as much as any of the other guests to stay there.","Melbourne, Australia",17,1.0

The location is in midtown and not too far from public transport. The staff is indeed quite friendly but the way the rooms are designed point you more to using it for purposes of a hotel room to spend a couple hours with someone you just met and want to get to know ""better"". If you have any doubts about this being the main aim of this place then the instruction of how to prepare your bed and use it at the back of the room's door leave no questions open. If a private bathroom with toilet and shower is important to you I highly suggest that you go to a different place. If you don't mind feeling like you're in less than the cell of a prison (aluminum chair and wash basin but at least a prison cell has it's own toilet) you're perfectly right here.","Munich, Germany",46,2.0

It had a very hostel-y/studenty feel to it but was very reasonably priced and in a great location for visiting the city. Overall there are good and bad points to staying here.The good:- Fantastic location. The hotel is walking distance to Central Park, Rockefeller Plaza and Times Square (but without any of the flashing lights or street noise). It is also 2 minutes away from a subway station with easy access to 3 main lines, and there are plenty of really nice places to eat (try ess-a bagel around the corner).- Although the showers are shared they are very good, and I never had to wait to use one. You get towels and toiletries. There is also a sink in the room so if you just want to quickly wash up there's no need to use the shared bathroom.- There's a safe in the room, free wifi, the TV works, the room was lovely and warm and the bed was comfortable.- It's very clean, and the check in, bell and cleaning staff are really friendly. You can leave your bags there for a day and they can also help arrange airport transfers for you.- Really good price for NYC, particularly single rooms.The not-so-good:- Ok, so the room is basically shoebox sized. Even for Manhattan (I've stayed here 3 times before). There is hardly any hanging space for clothes so I just lived out of my suitcase. This was fine for 3 or so days but would probably get a little annoying if you were there for longer. Also, I noticed the twin rooms have bunk beds so it would probably be a little cramped for two people. Having said this, in NYC you're not going to be spending that much time in the hotel room, so if you just need somewhere to sleep and dump your stuff while you explore the city, it serves its purpose.- It's not the quietest of hotels. There wasn't any street noise, but I was surprised on the first night when I arrived at 3am and there were people running up and down the corridor shouting. Also, if you're next to a bathroom (which I was) you can hear every time the shower is on or the toilet flushes. This didn't bother me that much, but would not be good if you were a light sleeper or wanted to go to bed early.- The bedding puzzled me. No duvet! An old fashioned blanket-and-sheets system and only one pillow. Was perfectly warm, and they made it every day, I just thought this was odd.I would definitely consider staying here again if it was just me, but if going with a friend or my other half we would probably pay a bit more for somewhere slightly more upmarket, or rent an apartment as we have done in the past.","Cambridge, United Kingdom",46,4.0

This location was perfect! I had to be a Radio City Music Hall for an event and it was a very walkable distance, even Times Square was pretty close! Check-in was very easy and the concierge helped me print a few confirmation pages from their iPad in the lobby. I will say the Bellhop could have been more helpful in pointing out the restrooms and such. I had a single room, so there were hall bathrooms you can use. They are for one person at a time and you use your keycard to get in. There is a little sign that says ""occupied"" and a small light in the rooms to show you which ones were occupied. Some rooms have bathrooms, so not that many people are using the hall baths. I never had a problem using one when I needed it. The showers were nice and everything seems pretty clean...you do need to bring your hand towel with you though since there aren't paper towels in the bathrooms for washing hands. I would suggest a small pair of flip flops as well, I mean, it is a shower others use. It was enough space for me for the two nights I was there.

It got a bit bothersome.- It cost more to call my boyfriend in Portland Oregon from the hotel phone than what it did to call Australia off my mobile- The room cleaners asked me in the hallway every single day if I wanted them to clean my room (I had a do not disturb sign on the door) and every day they asked me when I was going to check out. That wasn't too bad, but the con is that I felt like they were constantly vacuuming.

Also, for the bunk-bed rooms that use the shared single-person bathrooms, there is a lighted panel above the room door which tells you which bathroom is available (my daughter thought that was very cool). For NYC, it is a very good value for the money, especially the bunk-bed rooms. It is located a block or so away from the E subway.

We also chose it because it sounded unusual. We would stay here again. Let's review the positives:It is conveniently located;<20$taxi ride from Penn Sta; 2 blocks from the subway station; attractive wood slat blinds; we had an 8th floor room at the back so had (no view but) no street noise; there is a cute tiny private park across the street that is locked up at night; it was perfectly clean; no gym but New York Sports Club will give a daypass for 15$ 1-1/2 blocks away; there is a small room safe. We did not sample the tiny cafe in the lobby, or the bar attached. There is a Belgian restaurant/bar next door but we did not try it.But you also need to be aware of its limitations, and decide what is right for you, including:It is called Pod 51 because the rooms are small (perfect for one, small for two, too small for families). We had a regular queen-sized bed but the rooms are small cruise-ship size; passing another person around the bed is very tight; the in-room bathrooms are tiny one-person size. We came in cold weather with multiple layers; there were only 6 hangers in the open closet and only one coat hook; not nearly enough to hang multiple coats. Half the small closet held a box to hold a suitcase, so clothes on hangers had to drape over the dirty luggage. There was one small desk and one small desk chair; no other chairs. The maid brought a small dorm-room ironing board that rests on the top of the desk (if you take everything off the desk first). There is a (small) 20-inch flatscreen TV on the wall; no telephone; tinny I-pod clock-radio (which was not correctly set). For some reason there is a clear window into the bathroom (?to see the TV) so do not expect privacy sitting on the toilet. The rainshower shower head was nice but not if you want to keep your hair dry. The stainless steel bathroom sink/counter looks pretty until water splatters all over and the sink is so small it is hard to lean over it to brush your teeth; there is no soap dish and no washcloths (we bring our own; absence of washcloths is a European affectation.) The room doors are thin; fortunately we had polite neighbors.We had a private bathroom; to save money you can get a room with a sink but no toilet. The shared toilets-showers are much larger than the in-room bathrooms. We saw one bunkbed room; be aware that it is smaller than many college dorm rooms, and also has only one desk and chair.So do not be surprised.

Half the cost of nearby ""name brand"" hotels, and within easy walking distance of two subway stops, 5th Ave. shopping, restaurants, etc. (And while the hotel pitches itself as one for the ""youthful"" traveller, there were plenty of us ""older"" guests as well.) There are some drawbacks: My room, a single with a double bed, was perhaps the smallest hotel room I have ever been in--even by NYC standards. The bed was placed lengthwise against the wall with end tables at both ends. If there are two people and one has to get out of bed, they would, literally have to crawl over the other person. The bathroom while small, was adequate, except for the lack of an exhaust fan. Since not all rooms have a private bath, be sure to request one if that is what you want. Another problem is noice--not from surrounding rooms, but from the hallway. Since there are relatively few rooms per floor and the halls are narrow, you can hear doors openning and closing and conversations in the halls at all hours. Also, my room was directly behind two of the shared bathrooms in the hall, so I heard toilets flusshing and showers running frequently. Is staying at the Pod worth the savings?

We used our free drinks vouchers in the hotel bar and had a few more in there as it was such a nice friendly place to spend time in. The bar is open to the public and it seems to attract a good friendly crowd. If your visiting New York you shouldn't be spending much time in your room as there is so much to do. Therefore if you want a great low priced hotel within walking distance of the main attractions then look no further then this place. ,"Manchester, United Kingdom",26,5.0

I agree with others that this is a solid value for NYC. Esp. if you want to be mid-town.

For those of you that know what a hostile is...well this is pretty close to it other then you dont share your room with others. I went for pleasure with my friends who had never been to NYC. We decided 3 would share the room since we were on a budget. We knew we had bunk beds but we figured we would be gone of the day and would deal with sharing bunk beds. But when we walked into the room I realized my closet at home was bigger then the room! We got a laugh out of the situation thats for sure! There was no room really for us to move in the room. The best way to describe it was looking at prison sell where all you get is a bunk bed and a sink hahaha. Although I will give the hotel the room was very clean considering how old the property is. We noticed alot of Europeans where staying at this hotel which Im sure they are use to back packing everywhere in Europe. The sharing of the bathroom was a little weird for my girlfriends and I but we adjusted quickly. The staff was very welcoming and easy to approach with any questions. The only thing my friends and I were annoyed by was the construction going on right outside our room. But thats nothing compare to other issues you could encounter in NY.

They were renovating the lobby when we arrived to put in a bar (I think) but didn't notice any noise from that (or traffic either really) despite being only on the third floor above the entrance/street. I live in a city anyway, so sleep through most noise, but my country-dwelling friend didn't have any problems on this front either.We actually found the shared bathrooms to be to our advantage - being two girls, we saved time by both being able to shower at the same time (which meant more time to explore!) and due to the light indicator system there was no uncomfortable waiting in the hallway to deal with. The roof terrace is a great bonus and it was really easy to walk to lots of the key places you want to visit (Rockefeller, Bloomingdales, Times Square, etc.) plus really close to the subway.

Also our room had an air conditioner / heater and it was pretty cold one morning so I tried turning on the heat and it took about 20 min to turn on. By the time the heat actually came on it was time to leave the room. Although this is basically a ""nice"" hostel, it still cost about $250/ night, which is why I am giving this hotel an average rating. If this hotel was less than $200/ night would have gotten excellent. No excuse to not have hot water although this may have been the result of construction on 1st floor.

Choice was mainly based on price, reviews and the fact that it's a little quirky. We had stayed in NYC before so was familiar with the various areas and the Subway system so knew that this would be a good starting point for days out. We opted for the queen room with private bathroom as the prospect of sharing a bathroom didn't really appeal to us. Coming from London, we're used to compact spaces so weren't expecting a suite sized room for the money, and we were't disappointed.Due to our late flight, we were scheduled for a late arrival, but the holdups through passport control at JFK (2.5hrs!!!) meant we only just made the midnight guarantee! Initially we were put on the second floor and although the room was really nice, there were some issues with the room:The built in AC/Heater unit was not functioning, and instead of repairing the unit, they had installed a window box AC unit. Although these are common place for apartment blocks in the city, the installation was not too good. The trim surround was mounted only at the top of the frame, and didn't fit the window so couldn't be mounted at the bottom which left a large gap along the bottom allowing cold air and noise to enter the room. NY is exactly warm this time of year, so firstly it was very cold, and NYC isn't exactly quiet, so noise was an issue too. This was made worse by the fact that there was a large extractor fan just outside the room which was very noisy when running. The only thing blocking out noise and trapping any heat in were the blinds. These, as I'm sure you can imagine were not really that effective on both counts.So off i trundled downstairs to see if we could switch room. The night shift receptionist wasn't very helpful which was disappointing. I was told that there were no other rooms available that night unless we wanted bunk beds. The only thing he suggested was that we come back down in the morning to get swapped the next day. Now these may well have been the facts, but coming from a customer service background, i know it's how you dress the facts up that make the difference. I don't think i even got an 'I'm sorry you're not happy with the room supplied'. So off i went back upstairs and we dealt with the room for that night.Arriving back down at reception the following morning, i dealt with a gentleman who was in a different league of customer service. He apologised for the room, said the room swap wouldn't be an issue and gave us 2 options of HOW to swap in order for our day not to be compromised.We checked out of our room, left our luggage with the luggage guys (can't remember the official name!) and headed out for the day. Little bit apprehensive about the new room and had fears that it would go wrong somewhere, but arriving back, my fears were quashed. New room was on the 11th floor, had a better room layout, had a heater unit that worked, no window AC unit so the window could be completely shut, had nice views and more storage. Before heading out for the evening, i made sure that i thanked the front desk for the improved room. Really felt like our holiday had started.Didn't use the hotel for food and drink so cant comment on this, but i know they offered it and they had a vending machine at the front for 24hr drinks.Staff were all really helpful and would answer any questions.Location worked out great for us. Plenty of Subway stations close by, and not a long walk to the some of the key areas. Coffee shop at the end of the road (Pax) did nice coffee and various foody bits which was handy. And plenty of yellow cabs roll down the street if you prefer to use taxis.All in all, after the initial hiccup at the start, we had a great stay here and would definitely revisit if we wanted to stay in the same area.","Billericay, United Kingdom",43,4.0

All things being equal, I'd be giving this review 1 star, but to be honest, the location is brilliant, it's clean and the bed is comfy and while it's small it's efficiently constructed. That's pretty much where the good starts and ends. It's not a hostel, but since I'm staying in a room that doesn't have its own bathroom, it might as well be. Not to mention the fact that I have been here a little over 24 hours and I have had to have my card re-zapped four times. The internet works poorly with a pretty low signal, it took forever for pages to load. I don't blame this issue on the people who work here, they seem really nice, but clearly it's a genuine problem. I wouldn't be relying on using the internet while you're here. I never complain about a hotel unless I have complained about whatever the issue is to the hotel, but there isn't much they can do about this. Clearly they have a problem with their keycards. They tried asking me if I had it up against something (um no, it was on your desk, then I went to the toilet and back again, it wasn't even in my wallet). The people are nice enough about it, but seem bewildered, and clearly didn't have the agency to be helpful. The problem is that it means I now have to get fully dressed in the middle of the night to go to the toilet cos its so ridiculously likely that I'll have to go back downstairs again just like I did before. It was brilliant fun going downstairs to a lobby filled with people without shoes on and wearing jammies. And the guy on the front desk was nice, but seemed to have no sense that this might be embarrassing and a little wrong. I stay in 100 different hotel rooms a year and Yeah, if you're not a kid and interested in slightly better than hostel staying, with all due respect to it, maybe consider staying elsewhere. This was cheap (135 a night) as anything, so I understand the going around into another corridor to go to the toilet or use a bathroom, but it would be good if it worked. The upside is that the toilet/bathrooms were really clean and there was a signal in the room to show if any of them were free. Downsides were that it was pretty noisy thanks to the constant night traffic going to the toilet/doors slamming etc. I'm here for another two nights, let's see how that goes. 4 rescans of the card in one night... how many more could it be - we'll see?

I would say in terms of size that I'm about 5'10"", and anyone 6 foot or taller would probably find the bed uncomfortably small. The hotel is clean and well maintained, my single room had a sink, but not toilet or shower, so I had to use the shared ones on the floor: they were very clean and I rarely had to wait to use them.My only complaint is that there is really no sound isolation, so whatever is going on in the hallway you can hear (i.e. if some drunk people are walking to their room at 4 in the morning, you will be woken up by them as the door really blocks no sound). My iPhone charger was also damaged I assume by the cleaning staff when I was out.The bottom line is that it's not a good hotel compared to some of the alternatives, but at half the price of my other options, I'm willing to put up with the small room to save the money, so you are in fact getting good value for your money.","Montreal, Canada",29,4.0

Since it was our first stay in this magical city we wanted to stay in the heart of Manhattan, but nothing there is cheap whatsoever. When I got on TripAdvisor and found this gem I got excited. I rolled the dice and was extremely happy with my choice. From booking to the service everything was exceptional. I reserved the Queen Room with a view (ask for it!) and our private bathroom (which I wanted!!) and was accommodated. It feels exactly like it sounds, like a little Pod but big enough for staying in the city. Please note that it’s small that if I was taking a pee in the bathroom my fiancé could see me. Despite how small it was I really enjoyed my stay there. With that said it’s only walking distance to the St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and Times Square. Since you’re traveling and don't plan to stay indoors the size won’t affect you at all. One of my biggest surprises was the neighborhood, seeing as this was our first trip we were worried what type of neighborhood it would be, but were we happy when we found out what type it was. People are pleasant and walking at night, either shopping, walking their dogs, at the deli mart around the corner or the Pub around the other corner. We walked the neighborhood every single night after sightseeing during the day. Its relativity close to a subway station (2-3 blocks), and there are plenty of good restaurants close by. The cleaning staff always left our room spotless each morning. The concierge was always informative and eager to help. The rooms come with small LCD TV's, hair dryers, safes, phones, and docking iPhone clock radio. As well as a coffee shop, and free WiFi. The rooms are small but when you come to New York you don't need a big room because you are never going to spend time in your rooms unless you're coming for more than a week, in which case I would still recommend.

Pod 51 was perfect for us. We had a bunk room which was ideal. It is small but that is made clear on the website. There is hanging space, a small desk with chair, a safe, a small sink with plenty of towels, toiletries, glasses, tissues. The beds are comfortable and the whole place very clean. Having read some TA reviews I was a bit nervous about this. Your room is cleaned and the bed made every day. Good wifi and a personal tv. As we were out nearly all the time we just needed somewhere to sleep and wash!In the bunk rooms you have a shared bathroom. The nearest was directly opposite our room. There is a light system over the door inside your room that shows which bathrooms are occupied. In four days we never once met someone on our way to or from the bathroom and only once had to wait for about one minute. The communal bathrooms were cleaned at least three times a day....I heard the cleaner at 630 because I was awake with the time difference. Oh and there is piped music in the bathrooms that starts at about 730am I think...in the morning it is quite nice but in the evening I found the music choice a bit too lively!This is not a smart hotel. it is very much an upmarket hostel type place so we were impressed by the service features. In the lobby is a place you can have breakfast. We used it several times. It is not speedy but the food is good. The clientele is very mixed, all ages, nationalities. Locals come to the cafe for coffee and somewhere to sit. There is an excellent concierge service aimed at providing tourist information....very friendly and knowledgeable. Even if you know what you want to do it is worth talking to them as we got a two dollar off, priority queue voucher for The Top of the Rock by talking to them.The location is very good. Two subway stops in a few minutes walk, lots of nice places to eat including Bateau Ivre right by the entrance, shops for food and drink.Negative point is the street noise. You are in a bustling area so there is street noise all the time. Bateau Ivre is open until 4am and the garbage truck comes around at 530 plus there are sirens and New Yorkers love to use their car horns. We were on the fourth floor. There are twelve floors so maybe ask for a higher floor? The lifts are a bit slow..there are just two as the third is always used by staff. We were never bothered by noise from other guests.I would not stay here on a romantic break but with friends or my kids or on my own it is a great option.",France,13,5.0

It was small - but big enough for us, enough space for luggage and some handy hooks for coats etc. Space is extremely well used!Personal TV on each bunk, and a sink in the room too.Beds comfortable, though very creaky so could get woken up whenever one of us turned over. Not ideal! And the air con is very noisy - and not actually very effective. Not sure would be sufficient in the height of summer.BATHROOMSDecent - always one available when I wanted one, and powerful showers - lovely!Cold water a couple of times when I was later with a shower, and they could be a little grubby at these times too - nothing major, just a lot of hair in the drains and splodges of toiletries everywhere. What you'd expect from a well used bathroom.SERVICEGood. We asked to move rooms as we were given one with terrible wifi coverage (for a hotel that sells itself on the 'tech' it was a surprise that this happened in any room) - and this was done with no issues/hassle.You can leave your luggage on departure with the porter, and the concierge was really helpful when you could speak to her.She was, however, very often absent from the desk for long periods of time - so not quite the hours advertised.BREAKFASTNot included, but there is a cafe in the lobby which does breakfast. Mostly excellent - the waffles particularly. Sweet bagel was substituted for what was on the menu as a savoury one without checking which wasn't really on - and no real efforts to rectify when pointed out.Generally OK, though there were better places nearby.LOCATIONAmazing - East 51st is about halfway between Times Square and Central Park. No more than a fifteen minute walk to these places - but further to places like the Empire State but close to two Subway stations so everything was very easily accessible.  ROOFTOPThis is a lovely addition - amazing views over the city, and a lovely place to sit and have breakfast/dinner. Got very busy on the evenings, and the Wifi doesn't work up here - this would have been useful! OTHERReally do think the Wifi needs to be sorted - both for the roof terrace and in all rooms.

In the morning there is a lot of activity in the halls, with people speaking and slamming the doors, and the thin doors and walls let a bit of that noise through but at night it was perfectly quiet. The concierge was very nice and helpful, the little cafe in the lobby serves decent coffee and snacks, the lobby is well-designed, is very cozy. The double-tier outside terrace next to the lobby is very nice for sitting, so is the upper deck on the last floor of the hotel - the terrace has a table, lots of colorful chairs, and beech beds.

There were concerns about the room size and the shared bathroom prior to arriving but both were superb, especially when you consider the price and location.The hotel is located close to lexington/53 subway which takes you, easily and cheaply ($7.50 each way), to and from JFK via the airtrain (@JFK). Also there is a large supermarket on the corner of 2nd avenue and plenty of bars and eateries on the block.We spent very little time in the hotel itself, except for sleeping, washing and one night sat on the rooftop (very relaxed atmosphere and great views). The room wasn't as small as I expected and had plenty of space for 2 large cases (that we lived out of and left open all week). Pod 51 offers a comfortable place to crash after a lot of walking, shopping etc in the city. Each bed had its own small tv and the room had free wifi (never failed), alarm clock with iPod dock, small safe, open wardrobe, little sink and mirror, plenty of power outlets and fresh towels were provided daily. We also had no problems with noise from neighbours or people in corridors that other have experienced in other reviews.There were four bathrooms on our floor (8th) and never once had to wait to use one, all of which were kept clean throughout the day. It should be noted that the bathrooms were all different in size but all totally adequate (no. 2 was small. 3 was much bigger and had side jets in shower). All bathroom had shampoo and shower gel provided in dispensers within the shower.We didn't have much dealing with the staff except for checking in and out but they were pleasant. And we didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the small shop they had in the lobby.The inly real downsides was that the hotel didn't offer any form of welcome pack and no directions of where to find bathrooms (confusing at first). The only other small issue I had was the tv Aerial cable was damaged due to the tv and the bracket pushing against it, this caused bad reception on some channels (not that we really put the tv on for long).To conclude the review... I would happily go back to the hotel and would definitely recommend the hotel to others, especially those on a budget trip.One final thing worth pointing out... both pod hotels (39 and 51) offer free walking tours. These are run by streetwise walking tours. They have 3 different tours. I did the tour to china town departing the hotel lobby at 9.30am and taking short tube journey before weaving through interwinding Chinatown streets and sampling some food. The tour was brilliant and took me to parts of the city I definitely wouldn't have found alone. It's a great way to start the day and gets you to parts of the city you may not have previously ventured to... The hotel don't do enough to push this tour but ask about them at reception.",,10,5.0

However the room was looking a bit rough round the edges (frayed covers, seat), and the aircon unit in mine didnt really work. I had to sleep with the windown open which meant I got covered in mosquito bites. TV reception worked for maybe 50% of the channels.The shared bathrooms could do with some TLC, really smelly, and hot, and the shower facilities in each varied quite a lot (in terms of pressure etc).As with the other reviewer I found prices vary wildly depending upon when you book - So you often gets discounts if you book closer to the time. Same happened at POD 39 last year. Pretty annoying to me!Free wifi is good.All in all, if you're by yourself and not looking for the wow factor then it's fine.

There are a few on each floor as well so there's always one free.Green acre park is right across the street and it's a five minute walk to the nearest metro. If you're planning on spending a lot of time in the hotel I'd advise paying for somewhere bigger but if you're travelling and out all day then it's a comfortable place to come back to sleep in. The only bad things were the air con which. though keeping the room cool, was very noisy (as it was such a small place). We also found a big cockroach in the room that had climbed in during the night :s we told the front desk and they said they can't really help it as the hotel is near the river and they can get in through the air conditioning unit gaps.","London, United Kingdom",10,4.0

When check out came 2 weeks later we got $7 back off one room, $16 off the other bearing in mind 4 of us paid $20 extra on arrival. My friend showed them the conformation email on his phone which showed total cost including tax which showed a different amount to what we were confirmed. The guy behind the desk then started to try get annoyed about it as if we were in the wrong. Want my advice, go and stay in a couple hundred $ more hotel in a more recognised chain. You'll feel much more welcome and looked after in the Big Apple. I wouldn't stay here again just for the audacity of the $ they swindled.

The rooms are small and most of the bathrooms are shared bathrooms however it is a budget hotel and the bathrooms were spotlessly clean. We had two rooms for four people and had bunk beds which were fine and comfy, the rooms were small but not as bad as some people make out in previous reviews as like I say it is a budget hotel. The beds were very comfy so no complaints there. Check in was fine and I found the staff to be approachable and attentive on the rare occasion I needed any help or info. We never ate or drank here so can't comment on that side of things we left early in the morning and didn't come back until 10ish at night. If you haven't been before you can get the subway from airport to 53rd Lexington Av which is approx $7.50 per person much cheaper than a taxi and you get to experience a bit of proper NY on the subway. The hotel is 5mins walk from subway. We ate in the evenings twice at the BXL East bar a few doors up from the pod the food was excellent and the bar had a really good atmosphere with friendly staff. Try the spare ribs out they were excellent. The pod has a rooftop terrace on floor no 14 which was very chilled had coffee there one morning and it was very pleasant.One small gripe was that there were some noisy people on our landing who made quite a lot of noise when they returned in the early hours. I would expect someone from the hotel to sort this sort of thing out when it happens. However it wouldn't stop me returning as I have experienced this sort of thing in bigger and more expensive hotels than this.

Advice of the conceige was good freindly but unfortunately you need to be cautious about purchasing some attractions at the hotel. Example the Grayline hop on/hop off (Red or Yellow double decker bus same owners we learned), their street vendors are rather rude if you did not purchase from them (no commission if you purchse from the hotel). They may not sell you a ticket with your hotel voucher. You have to first find the main office at time sq to redeem complete your purchase. The wifi in the rooms was weak no it was actually useless. Often had to go down to the lobby to get useful wifi service. Should be a standard amenities these days. The big plus is you are very close to some great restaurants along 2nd avenue. Abit of a walk to time square the theatre district etc. Stay away from time square for restaurants. Example we tried once the Marriot ""the view revolving restaurant"", it is expensive ($8 cover charge after 8p) and the food was rather dissappointing/below average for taste etc but the desserts were ""to die for"" and the view was good.

The room was small with my own thermostat control and a nice sink with hairdryer and towels for the bathroom. The beds were comfy. There was no room there for two of us to sit down and watch a TV together like any hotel room I've ever been in, but I went in to it expecting that. We watched our own TV's from our own beds.

Some great choices for eating and drinking in the couple of blocks around if you don't want to stray too far, and the breakfast menu in the hotel cafe was a good way to start the day. I was there during a heatwave and didn't have any problems with the temperature or humidity in the room. The rooftop terrace was also a nice place to relax in the evenings once the temperature had fallen a little. I did hear someone comment on the small size of the rooms, but they are actually better than I had expected from the advertising; enough space for everything unless you plan to spend a lot of time in your room rather than the city itself. On that point, the rooms are pretty basic, but again I doubt many people go to New York to stay in the hotel all the time. I also never had a problem using the shared bathrooms, there were always at least 2 free on my floor when needed (and also clean). The staff were very helpful, and arranging a shared airport transfer with the concierge saved a lot of hassle.On the negative side, the wifi coverage was pretty variable. I had two separate stays over the course of a couple of weeks, and whilst the first room had no wifi problems in the second one (on the same floor) the wifi was pretty much unusable unless you walked halfway down the corridor. The doors also seemed to be pretty thin, so if there happen to be any particularly noisy people staying on your floor you are likely to hear them.Would definitely recommend the hotel and would happily stay there again.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",24,4.0

Loved having the safe and kept my laptop and extra cash in it. Room was quiet and comfortable.The hangout spots like the lounge are great. Everything was clean, bright, comfortable and smart. I would highly recommend this hotel. Especially if you are a single traveler- pay a little bit more than Hotel Carter and feel treated well!

We reserved a room with a full-size bed, which comes with it's own bathroom. Keep in mind the bunk-bed rooms have shared bathrooms. As you would guess from the name of the hotel, the rooms are very modest in size. Very small, but clean, well kept spaces. It was perfect for us because we were busy walking around the city so the room was simply a place to shower and sleep. The tv worked fine, with enough channels to occupy us late at night before we fell asleep. There is a safe in the room, which was convenient for us. We had a tablet with us and didn't want to carry it around the city. The front desk staff were very pleasant. We didn't need anything from them so I don't know how well they respond to requests etc. We have two small kids that didn't come with us, but if they had, the room would have been very uncomfortable if we needed to stay in it during the day for some reason. Also, my husband and I are thin people (me 120lbs, hubby 150lbs) so the full-size bed worked out ok for us. If you plan to share the bed and you're not fairly thin, you probably won't be comfortable in the full-size. It was basically an exact fit for us. The hotel is within minutes walking distance of Times Square and many shops/restaurants. The subway is a block away so we jumped on it often to get around the city. Travel tip: If you want to see the 9/11 Memorial or take a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty (statue re-opens on 7/4/2013, from what we were told), buy your tickets online first or get to the sites super early.

No parking on site but there is a parking garage very close by just up the street that gives special rates to Pod 51. It cost us $30.00 per day to park. That is a good deal anywhere in midtown. The room we had was a bunk bed room with shared bath. It was very clean. When you read other reviews that state the rooms are tiny, those reviews are correct. But it more than suited our needs and I would certainly return to that same type of room for the great price. The shared baths were constantly cleaned.

Was very pleased with the decision! The hotel room although small was perfectly formed, and well designed so that every bit of space was being used effectively, which was cool. Was a tad worried about having to share the bathrooms when booking, but the ones our floor were very modern and clean and if I were to return I wouldn't hesitate to book shared bathrooms again. I thought the light panel gadget which tells you which bathrooms are in use was a great idea, so you'd always know which ones were free. The staff were very pleasant, and helpful in organising a shuttle to the airport when leaving. As for the location, couldn't have been better really. We were able to walk to the Rockerfeller, Times Square, the Empire State and Central Park in pretty good time. The subway from E 51st is also pretty straightforward in terms of getting down to and from South Manhattan to the Brooklyn Bridge etc. Literally a straight line to downtown. The area felt safe and was quiet enough to get a fairly good night's sleep away from the 24/7 hustle and bustle.I visited some friends staying at a hotel/hostel nearby and they had a similar bunk bed style room, but much preferred the Pod due to the quality of the in-built bunk beds and the general atmosphere it had; along with the smaller details like the personal TVs for each bunk. The place was great value and ould definitely come back here again if ever visiting NYC.","Isle of Wight, United Kingdom",29,5.0

Overall the stay was exceptionally pleasant except for our very last night. As we were packing , we looked up to our horror to see a HUGE coackroach crawling on our wall. It was the biggest roach I had ever seen, and it was extremely upestting for myself and my sister (we are not used to ginormous bugs). We called downstairs and they sent someone up right away to kill it, which he did. And he was super kind about the whole thing because I was practically in tears. By the time he got to our room the bug had left the wall and made its way to the bed and my luggage/clothes. Still, the maintenance guy got rid of it and we were super grateful to him for his help. He even helped us move our stuff to another room, and checked out the room for us before we went in. We will never forget his kindness. Although, they gave us another room, it ended up having a damp floor by the sink, and when we put towels down, it soaked up a brown liquid? Not sure what it was, but it dried up by the morning. Needless to say, we did not sleep well our last night. I kept having visions of the roach on the wall every time I closed my eyes and half expected to see another one. Ugh! Had it not been for this incident I would have given the hotel at 5/5. We were up on the 10th floor, so I suspect the bug came through the window because the windows do not have any screens to keep critters out when they are opened, and we had left our window open when we left our hotel that morning. The room itself was quite clean, unfortunately the roach experience ended up taking away from the overall experience.Location wise, it's excellent, just a 15 min walk to times square, the United Nations is about 3 blocks away, as is the most amazing pastry place I have ever been too in my life! It's also maybe a two minute walk to the subway. We felt quite safe in the area as well (being two young females in the big city) and great restaurants and places to get your nails done are right outside your doorstep. If the hotel can put screens on the windows to keep out the bugs then I think one would be quite comfortable there because minus the ROACH experience this was a great hotel!","Calgary, Canada",0,3.0

Then we went to go to bed. My friend pulled down her covers and there were a few... um... black curly hairs.... YUCK!!!!! It was late and we were exhausted. She was attempting to sleep on top of the covers due to her findings earlier. Then it started. At first we didn't know what it was.

When I am describing the hotel to others, I say ""it looks like an IKEA threw-up on it"", but I mean that in a good way!

As a matter of fact, even when I travel on business and am on the company ""dime"", I usually stay here because I tend to extend my trip for pleasure and the hassle of moving hotels is not worth it. As I am sure other travelers have mentioned, the rooms are small, which is very common for NYC. Some folks think the idea of sharing a bathroom is weird, but honestly they are very clean and I've never had to wait more than a minute or so as they are typically 3-4 on each floor. The hotel is about a block and a half away from the 6, which is one of the main subway lines. Times Square is within walking distance, I'd guess probably 10-20 minutes depending on how fast you walk. The area the hotel is in is very quiet, so street noise is pretty minimal considering you are in NYC. The hotel attacts a lot of foreigners so you never know what kind of language you will hear in the elevator up to your room. Mind you, these are not your typical youth back-packers.

Basically the bed is turned sideways, and there's about 2 feet to walk between the bed and the wall.For this trip I was attending a writer's conference at another hotel. This was great because it allowed me to save approximately $100/night. I wasn't in the room all day, so it didn't matter to me what the room was like. It was somewhere to keep my stuff and sleep at night.The only thing I'd say is bring earplugs. The door was pretty thin, and I could hear people going in and out of their rooms all night.

The first was 6 nights before New Years until Jan 1st and then again at the end of Jan for 3 nights.My first stay I had a single pod with a shared bathroom. It was a nice room. Clean, enough space for me, it had a tv, safe and sink in the room which was handy if you wanted to wash your hands or brush your teeth. I really enjoyed the shared bathroom option in all honesty. Only a few times over the entire stay was the bathroom occupied, and there appeared to be 4 bathrooms on the floor, so you didnt have to wait long. The bathroom was very modern and nice. They were cleaned throughout the day from what I could see which was great...some guests can be messy and leave water on the floor. Etiquette is not hard people! The time of year was an expensive idea when I first decided to be there after christmas and for Dec 31st...but staying here was a steal! I expected to pay atleast $1500 if not more for this stay but it was only about $1000 for 6 nights including the busiest night in New York City for the year...how can you beat that???The bed was ok, Not the most comfortable but you have to be realistic and i tired myself out enough that I slept like a baby regardless so they weren't so bad just a little harder than I prefer.Location was good. It was about 20 mins walk to Rockefeller Center. But day or night (and it was bloody freezing when i was there both times) there were always people around and cars so i never felt uneasy. I walked from Times Square back to the hotel after the ball drop at 1am but on a night like that the city was still raging anyway. You just have to be aware of your surroundings wherever you are, its pretty common sense. But central enough for me and the subway was 1 block away (4, 5 and 6) so that made getting anywhere easy. All in all it was a fantastic stay, I saved hundreds and was glad to know I was returning in a few weeks. My second stay was in the double room with a private bath. I was happy with this room also, except my heater was not working when i arrived and due to the freezing temperatures I was immediately moved across the hall to a queen room with a bath. This was a very spacious room, but again I was alone but 2 people would fit comfortably here. The bathroom was very nice, just like in the shared ones. It also had a sink and safe. The bed was more comfortable this time around, but maybe because it was bigger than the single? Not sure, but i slept fine and enjoyed my stay there once more. I never really heard street noise either, and on the second stay I faced the street from the 4th floor, just the usual stuff here and there.Never had a problem with wifi while there on both stays. They have a snack shop with drinks and food which is handy but you have options all around you like McDonald's, Taco Bell, a panini store, duane reade and so forth. And in case you really fear NYC streets at night there was a police station literally at the intersection of 51st and 3rd before the Duane Reade so that was comforting. The price was cheaper since it was not a major holiday. Less than $300 for 3 nights...so again BARGAIN!!!!I will definitely stay here again, or even try the new pod on 39th to see what that is like. You can't go wrong here, why spend over $250 a night at least in the city when you get awesome savings in a place like this??? I will be back!","Montrose, Australia",109,4.0

I was really suprised to see two windows with great views. The room was small, but there was enough space for my large suitcase and clothes. The internet connection was great and sharing the bathroom wasn't much of a problem. Usually I was able to just walk in when I needed, and the bathrooms in my floor were clean and nice. Only problem for me was the heating. I was there in December and they didn't turn on the heat in the building until later in the evening. Because of jetlag I went to sleep pretty early in the first nights and it was really cold then. During the night the heater went on and then it was almost too hot. The location of the hotel is the best part. There are a lot of restaurants and Pax grocery store nearby. I ate breakast at Morning Star Cafe a couple of times, they have really good pancakes.

For what it is, it's a real gem. The rooms are very small as the name suggests and no frills. But if you aren't in NYC to lounge around your room, then this is the place to stay. I booked a single twin bedroom with a shared bath, and arrived at the hotel about 8:30am. Check in is usually around 3pm, but they had a room and let me check in. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. It was cozy and warm and had everything I needed, even a flat screen tv and a radio, desk and chair. Plus a real glass for the in-room sink. For such a small room,there plenty of storage space and hooks on the wall for coats. If it's too hot in the room, you can turn the radiator off and open the window. It was clean. The bathroom is tended to several times a day, and each time I used it, it was clean. The shower head was huge and had fabulous water pressure. I liked the housekeeping staff too. They were always around, helpful and friendly as well, and seemed to be very well managed. This section of NYC is fun also, with reasonably priced shops and restaurants all around especially on Lexington Ave. Price was excellent. I also liked the crowd that stayed there. They were international, young and old, Americans too, and fun to be around. The elevator was slow and full by the time it got to the 2nd floor, so I learned quickly to take the stairs.

I had never stayed in anything like it, but I gave it a shot, and it wasn't that bad. For the price, I would do it again. I would rather save 50-100 bucks a night and stay here, rather than stay in normal hotel and have my own shower. I should elaborate, that these aren't gym style showers....they have a door with a lock, so it is very private. Helpful tip: If you know you are going to need an iron and ironing board, you have to ask the front desk to borrow one upon check in, as the rooms don't have one. Be prepared for the ironing board they are going to give you....it is small and a countertop one.

It served our needs quite well. There were a few issues with our room, but for the cost, it was definitely a great deal. Problem 1: the heat was very hard to regulate. If it was on, the room was too warm (especially on the top bunk). If it was off, the room was too cold. There was a temperature adjustment dial, and maybe it did something, but it was not immediately obvious. Maybe with a few days to experiment, I could have figured out where to set it. But I ended up having to get up several times to turn the heater off and on.Problem 2: there is nowhere to dress privately in the room. There's a three-way mirror over the sink, and as a result you are visible from basically everywhere in the room. So if you want to change clothes or put on pajamas and you're sharing a room with someone who doesn't want to see you naked (or vice versa), you'll be wanting to change in the bathroom down the hall. Not a big deal, but worth considering.Other than those two caveats (and the fact that the room is very, very small), I'd recommend the place. Our room was very clean, had a functional safe that fit two laptops, and had comfortable enough beds. There were four bathrooms on the hall, which were all fine, and I did not ever have to wait for a bathroom. Amenities included soap, lotion, towels, bathmats, and hairdryers in the room, and dispensers with liquid soap and shampoo in the showers.This is very much a hipster hotel. Hipper than I am, but amusing. There's a little cafe in the lobby with excellent coffee and freshly delivered delicious baked goods. There was also fresh fruit and yogurt, which I did not order and so can't evaluate.","Bar Harbor, ME",13,3.0

I thought for the price, that I was surely going to be disappointed and wished I'd spent more elsewhere, despite the quality reviews I've read here. I couldn't have been more wrong. I did 'splurge' for the double bed and my own bathroom which I'm glad I did. I'm close to 6'-3"" and the double bed fit me fine from corner to corner. I'm afraid a twin might be tight in the bunked rooms. The room is small but very functional. There is a small desk unit and I was able to do about 3 hours of work one afternoon that had to be done. The internet was fast enough and I never had trouble connecting. The 'bathroom' was small but creatively done and the rain shower had plenty of hot water. I went to the rooftop which gave a nice view of NY. The location worked GREAT for me. I had meetings in that part of town and walked to Times Square, Broadway, Letterman, Today show and more. I flew into EWR, hopped on the train to Penn Station and took the subway to about two blocks from POD 51. There are a lot of favorably reviewed restaurants and pubs in the immediate area. I used the subway several times over my 3 days and it was easy from this location. I will stay there again when I go to New York. The first two evenings (Monday/Tuesday) my room was silent and the street noise failed to disturb me at all. The third evening (Wednesday) wasn't quite as quiet. There was a larger group that stayed down the hall from me and they weren't obnoxious but definitely louder and I used my ear plugs for the first time. One of the local pubs/bars also must have had a live show as the music was noticeable and kept me from sleeping a bit.  The concierge and front desk were surprisingly knowledgeable and helpful. Giving me some great tips on shows to see and being spot on with travel times on the subway or walking distances.

They informed me that the hotel was non-smoking hotel and they would take care of it - but they didn't say thank you for saying something or apologize for the inconvenience. My room (a Queen with a bathroom) - was spare and clean. The bed is made up with a coverlet and 4 pillows but no extra blanket. when i arrived, the heat was not on and I discovered the next morning that it needed to be turned on to keep the room warm! The bed was comfortable but the mattress was pretty firm. The desk was usable and they had plenty of power outlets and a hole in the desk for routing power cords. I found the bathroom a little small - requiring a little gymnastics; if you need a lot of room or are a ""big"" person it may be a little tight.

We called the hotel at 3 in the morning, to see if we could get our room a day early, and they changed our reservation without any problem. We got the Bunk Bed room with a shared bathroom and its not nearly as bad as it sounds. Although the room was small, we both could fit in the same bunk, so we didn't have to be seperated, and the shared bathroom was clean and relatively large. There are 4 bathrooms on the floor, and you have 4 little lights above your door in your room, to let you know when one of the bathrooms are occupied. Overall we had a good time, and the hotel is in a good location, about a mile from time square and even less from Rockefeller center. I would definitely recommend it.","Davisburg, Michigan",132,5.0

It is a basic hotel, but for what you pay for, its very good value and in a great area. The hotel is ideally located near to two subway stations and a selection of restaurants/cafés. We had a good sized room (Two bunk-beds) with an adequate amount of storage provided. The room had a large selection of towels, which are changed daily. The TV's fitted above each bed were great for relaxing after a long day sightseeing and had access to a large amount of channels. The room also had a reasonable view and a number of useful plug sockets. On our floor, there were four showers/toilets in close proximity. They were both extremely clean and spacious - One of the best showers I've had in years. The only negative I could state was that the safe didn't work. The hotel did offer to fix it, but we never got round to organising it as we had to be present in the room when the engineer fixed the safe. And I could also add that I think that the staff on reception could be a little more friendly and engaging. Apart from those two points, we were very happy with our stay. I would definitely stay there again. As stated in the title of this review, its great for those of you who want to leave in the morning and return in the early evening.","Cambridge, United Kingdom",26,4.0

If you are looking for a spacious, luxury hotel, don't bother reading any further - the Pod is not for you. If you want a great value, very clean, well located hotel with a friendly staff, you have found the place!I was at the Pod 51 as an advisor for a group of college students who were in NYC for a class for a week. The students stayed in the rooms with bunk beds (each with individual TV's) and shared baths on the floor. They told me that a lighted panel told them when one of the 4 bathrooms on their floor was free. Their rooms were small (think small cruise ship), but fine for kids who are used to dorms or shared apartments. They thought the rooms were just fine. I had a queen with a private bath. The room had an area to hang clothes, a small desk, 2 bedside tables, drawers under the bed and a small bathroom with only a shower. The room is well designed and there is a place for everything. I paid just over $1,100 all-in for 8 nights in NYC! And did I mention, it was CLEAN? Unbelievable!There is a small lobby with coffee, snacks, beer and wine. There is a roof deck that is probably very nice in warm weather (I lasted about 1 minute in January) and a lovely little courtyard as well. The subway is close by - 6 train 1 1/2 blocks away - C, E - 3 blocks away. There are tons of restaurants and bars along 2nd and Rock Center and Grand Central are easy walks. The bad: Small rooms, elevators can be slow especially when the maids are working and have one or two locked off. However the good; the friendly staff, clean rooms, tons of hot water, great location, friendly staff, free wifi, half priced happy hour in the lobby - make those small things seem rather insignificant.I only rated the service a 4 because it is a limited servcies type hotel, but those that they do have are nice. The rooms are a 4 simply due to size.",Seattle,31,4.0

I started going there during its last incarnation as The Pickwick Arms, and it has never failed to satisfy. It is good value, clean, friendly, efficient, and in convenient midtown. The single rooms are just too small for moi and I hate sharing a bath, so I haven't had that experience there, but the system seems to work well for everyone else. I usually just get a double room (with bath); just right, still economical, and once when my husband came, we took the room with the balcony - 'terrace room? - which is a bit bigger and very pleasant. Comfortable beds, too.Those who share the ordinary double room should be pretty good friends - the toilet-shower arrangement does not leave a great deal to the imagination, but this is a near-septuagenarian speaking, after all.I always look forward to my visits to the Pod - safe, clean, friendly, funky... a treasure..",New York,4,5.0

The room was very clean and stylish and was cleaned, tidied and replenished with fresh towels etc every day.

We both loved the area, 10 minutes walk from Grand Central terminal and there were also good bars and restaurant 2 minutes walk from the hotel.

It was extremely clean throughout the hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful.The only things I can moan about (not that they were a problem at all) is that the shower wall is glass fronted, meaning less privacy and the cleaners start hoovering extremely loudly outside your room from quite early and can be rather snappy if you tell them you don't want your room cleaning till 10am when they clean till 2/3pm most days anyway. Also the beds in the double rooms look a lot bigger in the pictures as they have been pictured making it look like you sleep with your head to the wall; however that is not be case, I would say they are small 3/4 size beds as opposed to double. This wasn't a problem for us as we are only a little couple, but if you were a foot taller I can imagine it being cramped. They are however the only negatives I can come up with. I would describe it as more hotel than hostel.

The room was cleaned every day while we were out and they did an amazing job, the shared bathrooms were also cleaned to a high standard. Our room was also always really warm which was great, as it was freezing outside and the beds were super comfortable. For what I paid for this hotel, I am actually amazed at the value for money. The location is amazing, there are subway stations really close by but we walked to Times Square and Bloomingdales/Central Park all the time. There are loads of irish bars around, including the Pig n Whistle on 2nd which we thought was great, and also The Smith if you want a really nice meal.I would definitely recommend this hotel and this area to stay in and will definitely stay at this hotel again.

The hotel has a very modern look to it and the staff is very friendly. The hotel halls smelt very fresh and so did the room. (Double pod with private bathroom) The shower has a clear door, so make sure you're comfortable with the person you're traveling with. Beds are comfy and clean and roomy enough. The room is very small, although that was to be expected after reading other reviews. We came to visit the city, not to stay in the room, but even then the size was fine for us. What made it amazing in my opinion is its vicinity to everything. 15-20 minute walk to Times Square and a pharmacy and McDonalds very close near by. The area felt safe - there's a police station less than a block away. The only downside to this is that it is a little bit noisy, but it is NYC after all.

Back then we stayed in a bunkbed room, which we enjoyed. However, this time we got a queen bed with a private bathroom. Yes, the room and bathroom was small, but you go to NYC to explore the city not stay in your room. The queen bed room is in the corner so we had great views of the NYC skylines both towards Time Square and looking North. The bed was comfortable as we slept with no issues. The noise was minimal except for doors slamming. My friend and I actually used the shared bathroom cause they had more space. The amount of people on the floor sharing bathrooms is minimal so they are always available. The service here is the same as 5 years ago, the only difference is they now have a concierge and a small cafe. However, love the staff here and for some reason always remembers you by your last name. Many Europeans stays at the Pod so it feels cosmopolitan. Pax is my favorite place to eat up the street, while Ess-A-Bagel is a great breakfast place when the lines are not long. There are two stations both one block away from the hotel. We walked to Time Square from the hotel, which was great because 51st takes you by H&M on 5th and Uniqlo, my favorite stores. On 2nd avenue around the corner are tons of restaurans, which my favorite is Pescatore. If you want a wonderful NYC stay, I highly reccomend this place, which also has a new location on 39th closer to Grand Central Station. However, I still enjoy the original Pod on 51st with it's service, location, and comfort. BON VOYAGE!","Atlanta, Georgia",56,5.0

The room also had a heater that kept the temperature very comfortable during the day and night.The only cons were that:- the walls were thin, so you could hear the sirens in the street during the night and people in adjoining rooms if they were being moderately noisy.- WiFi (included in the room rate) was a bit patchy at times, though after a day or two we found that there was a sweet point in the room (near the desk) where you could get good coverage. Great location. Short walk (approx 3 minutes) to the closest train station (6, E and M lines). Very close to plenty of buses that run along 2nd and 3rd avenues.

I came prepared that the room is very small so that wasn't a surprise. Claustrophobia was not at all an issue since I came from an equally cramped city! For $200 (tax inclusive), Pod offered a clean, quiet and convenient location in early December when other Manhattan hotels charge $250+ pre tax per night. I am very happy given the amount I paid for. There are 4 shared bathrooms on my floor which were very clean. Some are more spacious than the rest and very often I can choose from at least 3 out of the 4 bathrooms. I never had to wait to bathrooms during my stay. Location is unbeatable - Subway station is one block away. Both Time Square and Central Park are within walking distance. There are minimal facilities on site but for a short walk you can access restaurants or convenient stores that either operate 24h or late into the night. There is one minor complain though - there is only one wool blanket and bed cover on the bed. No down blanket (not too unreasonable for budget hotel). It wasn't very warm on winter nights even with the heater at max. I guess I would have gotten extra wool blankets if I requested. That was the only reason that I didn't sleep too well. This is the place to be if you are looking for a clean and comfortable place to sleep. Think twice if you come with a lot a stuff or are looking for space in the room - room is tiny and I doubt if one can lay two suitcases flat and still move around. Yet they try to utilize every bit of the space so I that very small room you get everything you need for a hotel (wardrobe, safe, desk and chair, sink, a lot of towels, tissues, hairdryer, a window and of course the bed!)

A little tip to those not too keen on sharing a bathroom with others, I was fully expecting it to be like the ones you find at any gym, open plan with shower cubicles next to one another, which I can’t stand! This was not what it was like at all! It’s totally private and a few short steps from your room. Even though we had our own small bathroom, we used these facilities instead as it was much more spacious. The roof top terrace is well worth checking out, if we’d stayed there for much longer I would’ve spent hours up there at the end of a long day walking, as the views are breathtaking and if you’ve never been to NYC, the terrace alone is worth the visit. We managed to leave our bags at the hotel, free of charge (we left a tip though) for the entire day as we were taking a train to the Hamptons later that afternoon.

I've had some very bad experiences. That said, I found this hotel to be clean and mostly comfortable, despite its size.This hotel advertises quite plainly that the rooms are small by design. So, anyone that complains about the size should never have stayed there. I give them a five on how cleverly they used the space. We had plenty of room for two bags and two people. I do think there would have been room for a small chair (or even a folding chair that could be put neatly in the alcove), and I definitely could have used one. Would also have been nice to have an outlet near the top bunk so I could have charged my phone and used it at the same time before bed - especially since there was no chair.We had a bunk room with shared bathrooms. I've never had shared bathrooms on a hotel before, but it really wasn't bad. However, would have been nice to have paper toilet seat covers available. Also would have been nice to have some paper towels for drying hands on, and a couple more wall hooks to hang clothes, towel, or toiletries bag. One hook was not enough. Tip: make sure you bring a bathrobe and some shower shoes.We did have an opportunity to see a room with a 'private' bathroom - it does not afford much privacy to your roommate, so better hope you are not shy.The staff was nice enough, but did not seem to go out of their way to help. So, good service, but not spectacular.The location was very good. Walking distance to rockerfeller center and 5th ave. Close to a subway stop that takes you right to times square or WTC.Overall, I would stay here again with a girl friend, but would not likely stay with my husband and kids.","Deltona, Florida, United States",6,3.0

I was glad I was staying alone because when I went to take a shower, the bathroom didn't afford much in the way of privacy. There was a frosted sliding glass door for the toilet, but once it was shut, it exposed a clear glass window in front of the shower looking into the room.The linens were clean and the beds adequate (I woke up refreshed, that's all I remember about them).

I booked a single room but got a bunk bed room which was fine. The shared bathroom was a bit worrying but when I arrived my room which was on the 8th floor was next door to a bathroom and it was always free. I loved the tv in the room. Both beds had a computer style tv which you could pull toward you at different angles. You could plug earphones into this tv too. The room was spotless as were the bathrooms on the floor and a light in your room indicated which bathrooms were in use. The lobby of the hotel was nice and had a good range of local beers which were nice to try. The only thing is that the hotel was a little noisy. Not so much with the ajjoining rooms but the corridor noise could be easily heard. Also the elevator had an annoying bell ring every time it opened on your floor which did tend to wake me even though I was down the hall from this. On check in I had prepaid the room however they took my credit card. When I checked out I told the receptionist that I had made two foreign landline calls. They told me that they hadn't shown up and basically implied not to worry and there was no charge owing. However when I got home I saw on my card that I was charged 47 dollars for the two calls that lasted 12 minutes in total..I never authorised the payment. I emailed the hotel twice and they did send me on the itemised bill. I still cannot figure out how two calls (not to a cell phone) cost that much!!

The lobby cafe was most useful when many cafes in New York were closed..Prices in the cafe were reduced by 50% during the storm as a goodwill gesture. Room service was reduced but even continued during the height of the storm when staff were unable to travel due to public transport closures. Reception staff were always helpful during a testing time with people trapped in New york due to airpotr closures.Concierge very helpful.

The room was about 2m x 3.5, but the light modern feel and the two windows made it very pleasant and cosy. In the room besides a very comfortable mattress there was a small desk, TV, IPod music docking, a small sink and a safe. The pillow was a bit thin for my taste and two more were brought to my room 2 minutes after calling the reception desk. On my floor there were 2 bathrooms for common use, a small led light in the room tells you when the bathrooms are occupied and despite spending there 5 nights I have never found the bathroom to be unclean and never had to queue although I guess it may be busier around 8 am.

At best, it could be described as a cheap student's dorm. A really cheap one, run by very, very unpleasant staff.On the first day, we discovered that the breakfast, who was supposed to be free, was in fact 15$, and served by a lady who missed her vocation: prison guard. She almost throw the 4$ coffee at us, with no smile, no thanks, and a remark about the tip we didn't give, after such service.The room, dirty and the size of a closet (and it was the biggest in all the ''hotel'') was not the one we reserved, was not ready when we arrived, at 5 PM, and the front desk guy was very unpleasant and impolite. We discovered later that ALL the staff was like him! Every one of them, wich means at least seven people. Impolite and extremely rude, they were absolutely of no help for anything, even essentials... First, we had to ask for the maid for three hours, on the first day, when we found used condoms in the bathroom and beside the bed. The spread on the bed was stain and extremely thin, the heat was broke (in five days, no one came for reparation, and we ask two times a day) and we were frozen, so we ask for a blanket, that we got on the third day! We had to find the maid each day and ask for the towels, the shampoo, the soap she didnt left in the bathroom she never cleaned in five days, for that matter. If you didn't stay in the room during the cleaning and ask for it, the maid did not replace anything, like the sheets, and did not clean anything! She was just emptying the garbage can and that's all!The wi-fi was also supposed to be included, in our room, but the signal, when there was one, was not nearly strong enough to get caught by our computer and iPhone.We got no hot water for two days, even before the hurricane Sandy, where we got ourselves stucked in this place for two more days. Their response? Its the same for everyone, so, stop asking! At 255$ a night for the room, which was supposed to be 175$, it's hard to believe, but it's not the worst thing we saw at the pod... The bed, for exemple, seems to be made of cement...During Sandy, the price of the room doubled, even if there were no services at all in the hotel(maid, hot water, wi-fi)and there was absolutely no trouble in upper manhattan, except a few drops of rain and the subway, which was closed. They were clearly taking advantage of the situation, because they knowed that the clients could not leave. Port Authority, JFK, Armtrak and Laguardia was closed, and I finally preferred to pay 1000$ to a perfect stranger to drive us to Montreal instead of staying one more minute in this place.I traveled around the world for years, and its the worst place I ever seen in my life. It ruined our trip, totally, and the perfect last touch was the bill: they charged us 400$ more than it was supposed.Do not believe what there saying on the website: I never seen a such amount of lie since Richard Nixon...Stay away of this place, even if you have to go to a homeless shelter: it will feel the same, anyway, and at least, you wont get robbed.","Montreal, Canada",22,1.0

We were in town for an event at the Barnes & Noble on 54th.At first I was hesitant to stay so far up and east in the city; my usual vicinity is close to Penn Station, near Macy's...but I'm awfully glad the Pod offered the most competitive pricing for a double occupied room. I was amazed at how truly convenient to just about anywhere this hotel is. I flew into JFK, took the AirTrain to Jamaica Station and from there it was only a few stops via the E train to 53rd and Lexington. Once I came up to street level the hotel was only a short walk away (a block and a half to be exact). When I needed to head to ChinaTown, the E train took me right where I needed to be and again was only a short walk from my destination. The E also stops at Penn Station, so I could've come in via Newark as well and it been just as convenient.Okay, on to the hotel! When I arrived, the gentleman at the front office was very courteous and combined my two reservations seamlessly so I didn't have to check out and check back in, or worse, change rooms. Our room was very clean and while it is compact, it totally served our needs. The bunk beds were very comfortable and afforded me the darkness to sleep while my night owl companion used head phones and stayed up into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing me once. I would've liked more pillows -- I'm a pillow hog -- but I didn't call or ask for extras so that's my bad. The bedding was comfortable and clean. We were given a room with it's own bathroom so that was very nice; even though it was very compact. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying. I have size 11 feet and had to put my feet on the shower lip, or have them bracing the bowl. And the shower has a great rainwater head, but it's squarely in the middle of the stall; it would be nice if it were adjustable or handheld, just because the stall is very efficient in size (i.e. it's small).We didn't eat at the hotel and I didn't really investigate the property; but the things I needed were conveniently available and I would definitely stay here again!One more thing, the windows in our room did open which was very nice; but it would be great if there were screens on the windows to keep insects out.

As I mentioned in my first review, the hotel is very well located for subways, restaurants, and some sites, and the hotel staff (including a very helpful concierge) and common areas (lobby area with wall-mounted i-pads and snack bar, roof deck, and courtyard) provide the ingredients for a wonderful stay in this magnificent city. I had reserved a single with private bath and was upgraded to a double with private bath. I greatly appreciated the extra bed space! In some ways, though, I thought this room a little less well laid-out than the single en suite room I occupied last year. In particular, the toilet was rather poorly positioned and would, I think, be uncomfortable for a large person. Otherwise, it was comfortable and efficiently arranged, and it met my needs exceedingly well.I will definitely return to The Pod when I next visit New York City!","Washington, DC",240,4.0

Only required a 1 night stay on either side of a cruise ex NYC. The booking process was handled very efficiently as well as subsequent enquiries. The hotel is located in a good area, close to all amenities and very close to the subway and very easy access on subway from JFK. But the reality is different from the pictures on the website - not nearly as bright and cheerful ! And size is an issue if you are not prepared for it.Got upgraded on the first 1 night stay from a bunk room to a twin bedded room. It was a squeeze and the ensuite bathroom an even bigger squeeze. Not sure how large people would be able to use the toilet. Am sure those walls have many funny stories to tell. But it was clean and did not require the use of a shared bathroom which was a bonus. The cabin and bathroom on our cruise was bigger ! On the return stay, did not get upgraded so had to stick with the bunk room. (The cost of an upgrade is quite extortinate). It is SMALL especially with more than one suitcase in the room. Well insulated room so very stuffy and need to use the aircon. The shared bathrooms are kept reasonably clean and have sufficient room to move about. The one shower I used had only one temperature - scalding !The front desk, concierge etc are efficient but not over-friendly.

I wanted to find an inexpensive hotel in a good location and the Pod definitly fit that description. I liked the photos online but was disappointed when our room looked nothing like what I saw online. We got a room with a private bath and the entire bathroom was literally smaller than a bathroom stall at Max Brenner's in Soho. I didn't mind it at all b/c we literally were just there to sleep and spent ALL day walking around exploring so for me it was adequate. My hubby wasn't too pleased with the room b/c there was just NO room to put your stuff and his feet hung off the bed at night (he's only 5'10). Also even with the private bathroom there is NO privacy. If you have the slightest bit of embarrasment about going to the bathroom in the same room as your travel partner then stay somewhere else. If I were traveling alone I would absolutely stay here again, but if we go as a couple we're going to find another option. Also they didn't turn on the air conditioning in the hotel and it was SO hot! This is from someone coming from Texas.

In terms of price point, it is considered cheap especially since hotel rates in NYC are quite high for good quality >4 star hotels.I must say, the hotel had a good location. The subway is about 5 mins away maybe less. There's also a Duane Reade (eqv to Boots in the UK!) just one street away so you could buy water and snacks here. The decor at the lobby had character but the lifts were very small. It was quite busy when we first checked in so had to wait a while for our turn to take the lifts as everyone had big luggages with them. There were no ensuite rooms available for me to reserve online so I ended up with the bunk bed (2 people) with sharing bathrooms. I must say I did not know what to expect as I have never stayed in a hotel that shared bathrooms! It wasnt as terrible as I thought it would be. They had a light indicator in each hotel room for each of the 4 bathrooms so you know which ones were occupied. Note - bathrooms tend to be busy in the morning so if you plan to use it in the morning around 8am be prepared to wait. Else, just wake up 30mins - 1 hour earlier. It was clean(ish). The bathrooms looked old so dont expect Hilton standard bathrooms! The floors were clean but I wore plastic slippers whilst showering (slight germ phobia on my side). They provide body wash and shampoo but I preferred to use my own. The room itself was small. Enough space for one huge luggage but if you had two, I dont think you'd have much space to move around in the room. They do provide a sink with lots of clean towels in the room.

Also great cause theres a heap of good restaurants right on the street so you dont have to walk far at night to get a great meal. The room was small but adequate. No room to spread out and sort suitcases etc. The system to letting you know which bathrooms were free saved a lot of hassle. The bathrooms were clean and tidy although very humid/muggy on a hot day.

We were so excited to stay in this hotel. I didn't care that it was small. We got our keys, went upstairs, turn on the light, and BAM! Huge cockroach on the floor. I ask my girlfriend if I'm seeing things, so she goes closer - the thing starts running fast, so it was very much alive. We go downstairs for a refund, and we had to fight with the man at the front desk to get one. He NEVER apologized - not once. I might have actually forgiven them if they had shown the least bit of customer service, but no. His first suggestion was that they spray the room. We were appalled - they weren't even going to move us initially! As though we paid for a night in the hotel to hang out with dead bugs and toxic spray. Then, he offered to move us, but by then, we were disgusted with the hotel's service, we refused to pay to stay there. We finally got our refund (trust me, I'll be checking my credit statement this month), but not without him acting disgusted with us and telling us ""well, if you want to go home, then fine."" If this were any other hotel, they would've comped us a room for the night at the least. Even he'd apologized at any point, I might not have written this review - but there you have it.

Enough room to store my stuff, unless you have a big suitcase... Wifi was sometimes shaky... Staff was nice, just ok. The only annoying thing is the constant music in the hallways and in the elevator. But I thought it was good music, very eclectic, so it wasn't too bad. Very very nice rooftop. Didn't try the little restaurant but it seemed quite nice. The only thing missing was a fridge in the room. If I went back to NY by myself, I would definitely go back in a double.

The location is great, we liked the rooftop sitting area, and the concierge was very helpful, helping us get around on our first visit to the city. There were a few things about this hotel that really didn't work for us. First, the room is very small. I understand that this is typical of NYC hotel rooms but it was particularly bad because the tinted sliding glass door to the bathroom didn't close and the other part of the bathroom wall was a clear glass window. There was no way in the small room to avoid seeing someone sitting on the toilet when they were in the bathroom. Also, we did a lot of evening events so tried to sleep in late some mornings. On 4 of our 6 days we were awakened by the knock or vacuuming of housekeeping, one day at 9 and the other at 9:30. There was no ""Do not disturb"" sign in the room to prevent this from happening.

I was prepared after reading comments on here to expect extremely small rooms, but they aren't bad at all. I've traveled a lot in Europe, and that's what this place reminds me of: a hip, quaint European hotel or pension. My room rate was AMAZING for NYC -- $129 for a queen (?) bed and private bathroom! (I don't know if that's the normal rate or due to a slower time of year, I went right after Labor Day). VERY, VERY CLEAN. The housekeepers really take their jobs seriously.Great location, steps away to several important subway lines and other midtown attractions. Excellent restaurants within blocks, in all price ranges.Rooftop deck and the garden courtyard are gorgeous and a peaceful respite from an otherwise hectic city. Would be nicer if they had a full bar available, but the little coffee bar downstairs in the lounge sells beer and wine and has a cheap happy hour. I understand that they are currently renovating a restaurant next door to the hotel to include a full bar; this will be a wonderful addition.Service was top-notch, especially for a ""budget"" hotel (although you really wouldn't expect it to be so reasonable by looking at it, it could easily be in the pages of those ""HIP HOTELS"" books. I reckon the bijou sized rooms are why they charge so comparatively little). Front desk lady was very sweet and made me feel very welcome. Concierge was extremely helpful and chipper, and his recommendations and suggestions were spot-on.OK, so here's the only negative, and the reason I took off one star: while hanging out in the lounge area downstairs to use the free ipads for the internet, several times I watched this very old man (sorry, I don't mean to offend anyone, but he really must be in his 90s) bother and harass people. It was like watching your senile grandfather let loose at the family reunion. I deduced that he must be the manager or something, which I find hard to believe since this is such a hip, ""young"" hotel and clearly not his scene. He would just go up to people who would be into a book or involved in a conversation, and just start talking people up. He tried chatting with the girl at the ipad next to me, who did not speak any english, and the more she kept saying ""No english"" the more bothersome he became, trying to figure out which language she spoke, talking louder, etc., and it was clearly freaking her out, so she left. It was awkward. So if you stay at the Pod -- and I do recommend that you do -- steer clear of the old man or else he'll talk your ear off.",Portland,1,4.0

On my recent trip to New York, I was able to book a room at Pod 51 for a five night stay. Since I took the red-eye to New York, my flight landed super early so the hotel was able to store my luggage while I went about to explore the city.The room I had was clean with clean floor, bed, shower, toilet, and sink area. It was very well organized with great use of space, NO BED BUGS, and most important - GREAT WIFI! Most reviews would say the rooms were small, but I didn’t find it too much of a problem or I imagined it would be smaller based on what everyone had said so I was pleasantly surprised.I liked this hotel because of its GREAT LOCATION. It is right next to the 6, E, and M subway station as well as being within walking distance to a TON of great spots to eat (places I bookmarked to try) It’s right next to: Madison Restaurant, Choux Factory, Ess-A-Bagel, and Tsushima. And about 10 blocks from Serendipity 3! If that’s not enough, the location is nice enough that you can take the subway to more places like the 53rd and 6th Halal Cart. Also, the hotel is a short subway ride to the LOVE sculpture, and it is right next door to Greenacre Park. Regarding the beds, it was more towards the firm side. The air condition in the room worked perfectly, and the water was strong vs. some hotels where you only get a trickle. (BTW I was on the fourth floor). The room I had gave me a view of the streets right in front of the hotel… it was an okay view. But if that’s not good enough, check out the view on their rooftop patio! Another great factor in choosing this hotel is that it was in a super safe area and there were always lots of people walking around at all hours of the day. Customer service was good! BTW if you’re going to book a room here, you would be better off booking ONLINE. I received a totally different (HIGHER) price for the same room when trying to call vs. what the price online was showing.One last thing, there are ipads in the lobby so you are able to print out your boarding tickets down there for free. Also, visit the concierge if you’re going to be touring the city, they’ll be able to hook you up with deals for example VIP access to the Empire State Building, plus a free gift.I would definitely be booking a stay at Pod 51 the next time I'm in New York, or I'd try out Pod 39 their sister hotel for cheaper!","Los Angeles, California",13,5.0

I wish I could keep this place a secret because as soon as everyone knows about how great it is there won't be any availability! The Pod, during many times of the year, is a very fairly priced hotel in Manhattan. So close to the UN and subway stations you could go anywhere from here. The deco has a funky-Swedish-Ikea tone to it. The rooms make very good use of the small spaces. Really, in NYC why the heck would anyone spend time in their rooms anyway? What will likely put you off the 'shared' bathroom idea but it didn't bother me at all. Its no different than when you lived in a dorm in college but I bet your college dorm wasn't nearly as clean as The Pod. I swear, someone is hiding around the corner to run into one of four bathrooms on your floor to make sure its perfectly sanitized before the next person walks in. From your room there is a light indicator that tells you which bathrooms are available. The rain shower heads are heavenly! The bunk bed room is fun and gives you your own space and TV when traveling with a friend. I always check The Pod first when I come to NYC which is often.

We were 5 min walk from a subway stop, 15 min from central park and 20 min from time square. The hotel was what we expected and more. The rooms were small but clean.

The rooms are small, but adequate with a TV and desk. There are ipads attached to a pillar in the lobby, a nice addition for a last minute check on tourist sites before heading out. The roof-top patio was awesome, great view of the city. It was the perfect place to have a few beers before dinner or a coffee and pastry in the morning. The staff were all helpful and eager to offer assistance. Don't forget to tip!I would not buy much food from the lobby bar as I found it over priced for what we got. The only water they had was of the ""designer"" verity and was about $5 for a small bottle. Get food from some of the great restaurants close by and a 6pack from the store on the corner and take it to the roof top!

The bathrooms are very nice, with excellent showers, and the indicators in the room are convenient. I loved the breakfast backyard and the rooftop terrace! Service was also good, and the hotel was nice and quiet at night.

The rooms themselves are just about the right size for a bunk bed, although you definitely only have space to sleep and change in there. We were anxious about the shared bathrooms, however there was always at least 3 bathrooms free everyday. Not sure if this was due to our floor (10th) having more ensuites than others but it was ideal.The customer service was fantastic. The front desk were really helpful in letting me know about the hidden charges (always very wary about the security deposits hotels place on credit cards - but pod only charge $20 and refund it) and the concierge gave us maps and recommendations whenever we needed. I've stayed in 'luxury' hotels in NY but I honestly would just use the pod in the future. The only issues I could bring up about the place are the lack of free breakfast and that its location is not entirely central. It's a borderline between walking to the main attractions or using another mode of transport, but the subway is really cheap (I think $30 for unlimited week passes)","London, United Kingdom",18,5.0

I was here during the New York heatwave and really appreciated the location, as it meant I could walk around Manhattan for half a day, head back to the hotel and chillax for a bit and rest my legs, and then head back out. The location is great, just a block away from the subway, which I caught all the time (definitely get the subway 7 day pass, totally worth it).To the rooms - I travelled by myself and got the single pod with the shared bathrooms. I was expecting tiny rooms after reading the reviews, but the space was perfect for me. It was enough to walk around a bit and fit my large suitcase, but you will be outside most of the time anyway! The bed and pillow were comfortable, very convenient to have a sink in the room, but the shared bathrooms were really great as well! I expected one bathroom with several showers on each floor, and actually 'sharing' with other people, as in bumping into each other in the bathrooms, but it is actually four separate bathrooms, each with a shower, toilet and sink. So technically it's your own bathroom, you just need to walk outside your room (which is only about 10 steps away!). There is a clever light indicator in each room telling you which is free. There was only one time when all the bathrooms were taken on my floor so I just walked down to the next floor and used theirs - all the bathrooms are different though (some larger/newer than others), so have fun choosing your favourite! I found I usually went to the same bathroom each time ;) The bathrooms were always spotless, I always say housekeeping cleaning the bathrooms and keeping it well stocked. I found my fellow travellers always kept the bathrooms clean anyway, the only thing needing to be mopped up was water on the floors.The only negative points I had were that the aircon is quite loud. Considering that I was in NYC when it was around 34 degrees Celsius every day, it got a bit stuffy at night if the aircon was off, but it was too loud to sleep with it. My room was also facing other buildings which inevitably also had aircon systems running, so the windows weren't completely soundproof and it was quite noisy at night, but after long days of exploring the city, I dozed off to sleep quite easily - not too much of a hassle. Was not affected by street noise. Another thing was that the wifi wasn't working particularly well for me unless I sat right near the door. Reception was great near the lifts, I think it was because my room was right at the end of a corridor. I still had access, it was just slow at times and would drop out constantly - made it difficult to Skype to my sister back home! Surfaces were also a bit dusty but didn't really bother me.In saying that, I paid around $100 a night during July (high season I believe), and it was between the Pod and the Jane. Ultimately the fact that the Pod was closer to the subway, had a sink in the room, and looked more new and modern won me over. The concierge helped me with transport back to the airport (from memory $20 to Newark which is comparable to taking public transport but it was a shuttle so was faster). Great use of space in the rooms, towels were soft and fluffy, housekeeping ladies were super friendly and always greeted me in the mornings and asked if I wanted by room cleaned. I really enjoyed my stay here, will definitely come back in the future and did not feel claustrophobic at all (as a single traveller I felt very comfortable). It's in a safe area, I constantly came back late-ish at nights and caught the subway which was absolutely fine. I wouldn't hesitate staying longer too! 7 nights in NYC was definitely not enough to experience this amazing city :)","Sydney, Australia",53,4.0

It's a private park the size of a city lot where you can sit at a small table under trees, gaze at the waterfall, and have breakfast or lunch from a small kiosk by an organic bakery, Birdbath, serving espresso drinks, fresh biscuits, scones and muffins and light items for lunch & afternoon. The Pod Hotel: The hotel only has those horrible polyster pillows that don't conform to your head so I had to go out and buy a proper pillow. The free wireless didn't work in our room. The free computers in the lobby were mounted on pillars so you had to stand with your arms raised in order to use them - an inventive way of keeping people off of their computers for more than 3 minutes at a time I guess. The fellow at their coffee kiosk was surprised that I wanted to order a coffee during their posted hours - ""My shift is over in 10 minutes"". The reception clerk was astonished that we wanted to pay our bill the night before our departure - ""I've never heard of anybody wanting to do that"" - and made sure we knew what a burden it was for him to do it.

I opted for a queen sized room with bathroom. I'm Welsh and by European standards the room wasn't that small. I gather that Americans are used to far bigger hotel rooms? It was clean, modern and everything I needed for a couple of nights in wonderful NYC. The bathroom was probably as small as it could be (I'm sure that toilet wasn't a full size one!) but it was fine. I would probably opt for West Manhattan next time, but it was still very central and I walked everywhere -20 mins on foot to Times Square isn't bad!! The price compared well in a city where rooms are extortionate by London standards. So regardless of the following gripes this hotel will always be full! It's a fairly fool-proof concept. But good god, how rude is the main man at reception? I'm talking comedy rude - downright offensive. Think Basil Fawlty or a man who seriously dislikes his job / people. Unfortunately he was the first New Yorker I ever spoke to and his manner was just unacceptable - he was even ruder to a South American lady with a poor command of English. I heard other people complain about this. To think that he has chosen to work in the service industry! Hospitality! HELLO?! Frankly though how much are you going to speak to the guy in reception? The other latino staff members were lovely. Final gripe - poor internet. If this is a deal breaker, you may want to choose another hotel.","Cardiff, Wales",65,3.0

Kudos. - It is 1.5 blocks to a local subway station and 3 to a major stop so it hits high for convenience. - We stayed in a room with a bathroom (micro but again, good design overcame much). One night an air vent had us hearing the midnight ""Happy Birthday"" of a group of partygoers on another floor but the noise died down soon afterwards.- I reserve the highest praise for the most excellent concierge who genuinely sought us out to pass along some excess city passes, vetted Broadway shows to find something my daughter would like and was generally very welcoming. The cafe staff were pretty good too (would it kill you to stock a bit of greek yogurt so we could get a bit of protein at breakfast? a small minus). All in all, we were very happy with our stay and the chance to hear the great diversity.

Look, if you want to stay in a large room, this is not the place for you; but you also don't pay the crazy NYC prices. I read an interview with the owners of the the hotel that stated they are normally sold out and could easily charge more for rooms, but they purposely don't so that make staying in NYC more affordable for budget-minded travelers like myself (and this place is WAY more cool than a bland budget chain hotel). Take a look on here for what other hotels in the area are charging, then complain.Staff is always helpful and nice, only had a couple grouchy front desk people in the dozen or so times I've stayed here. They have also started doing more things like organizing free group walking tours around the city. I've always met nice likeminded travelers here and keep in touch on facebook.Always clean, even the shared bathrooms. I would also like to point out -- to those who recoil at this idea -- this does not mean the guest rooms are connected by shared bathrooms, they are common bathrooms located in the hallway; the toilets are separate from the shower rooms and all are private with lockable doors. EACH GUEST ROOM HAS A SINK! If you have ever traveled to Europe, you will no doubt have seen this before. No wonder, then, that most of the hip guests staying here are European and don't seem to mind it at all.To the people who complain about the sizes of the rooms: you are fooling yourselves if you go to NYC and expect to stay in an average American sized hotel room for under $300 a night.

The room was compact but served our needs - there was a small vanity sink, an open closet, desk with i-pod docking facility, wi-fi, a mini TV for each bunk and clean towels provided daily by the excellent maid-service. I agree with one of the other reviewers about the noisy air-conditioner unit but to be honest I got used to it (and was INCREDIBLY grateful for it !) and it was only on the first night that it presented a disturbance. The air-con also acted as a fridge...we were able to keep a couple of beers reasonably chilled by standing them on the vents !The roof-terrace is terrific although the seating is limited. It was a great place to eat or to just sit and read/soak up the sun/cool off in the evening...drink AC-chilled beer ! There is a 'cafe' of sorts in the lobby which provides a range of snacks and a breakfast for around $11 which can be eaten on the breakfast terrace. The snacks are available until 10pm and there are a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks available. The hotel seemed to have absolutely no objection to us bringing food in and eating it in the cafe area/on the roof/in the room but there are some pretty good eateries nearby (see my review of Johnny Rocket's diner on E56th and 3rd). The women in the cafe/snack-bar were (mostly) very accomodating - in fact I was quite taken aback by the eye-rolling and tutting of one of them (I asked for some milk for my tea !) because it was SO out of character for the staff who are really helpful and courteous generally (maybe she was having a bad day !).The shared shower-rooms are not a problem at all (although we did find a dead cockroach in one of them one evening....but hey, it could have been worse !) - there is a little light indicator in the bedrooms that shows you when they are occupied so you don't have the annoyance of the fruitless trek in you PJs on a morning ! Just a word of warning though - when maid-service are on the floor on a morning they (obviously) need to clean the showers so they are out of action for 10-15 minutes...so you won't be able to go to the loo/shower in that period !!I liked the Pod Hotel - I would recommend it to anyone wanting a reasonably priced place to stay.

We had a corner room (Queen pod) this time around, so we had two windows, which brought a little more light into the room. Housekeeping kept the room very clean, and the location can't be beat. Our complaints are the same as they were last time: a fridge in the room would be wonderful (we ended up buying a small cooler bag at REI to keep our drinks cool) and the very small shower has no hand-held attachment - when you're in there, you're either getting your head soaked or you're leaning to the side to avoid the spray. The outdoor cafe is pretty, but the food has diminished in quality since we were last there - we found the same yogurt and granola breakfast offered - but with much better quality and less expense - at Le Pain Quotidien, which is around the corner on 2nd Avenue. While the Pod provides clean, basic lodging in a central area of Manhattan (love that subway two blocks away!), we plan to travel with a child the next time, and the Pod is just not suitable for families.

Also close to the Subway which will take you almost anywhere you want to go. The hotel is clean – housekeeping does come in everyday. We also experienced no problems with the check in and check out process. We found ONE of the Concierge Staff very helpful – Cara. She helped us work out the best routes around the city and also confirmed several bookings for us. However, one of the Concierge Staff appeared reluctant to help – barely looking up to even acknowledge us when we asked questions. Furthermore, most of the staff at the front desk are unhelpful. When we asked them even the most basic of questions they refused to answer and sent us to the Concierge – we suspect this was to ensure that the Concierge made his tip. We resented having to constantly tip the Concierge – we felt as if we had already paid sufficient for the hotel and this should include basic information. One example of this was when we asked ‘Is Trump Tower the same as Trump Plaza?’ The front desk claimed not to know the answer to this and sent us to the Concierge who provided us with incorrect information stating that Trump Tower was ‘all residential’ and not open to the public! After deciding to go anyway we in fact discovered that the atrium at Trump Tower is FULL of shops and is indeed open to the public. With regards to the room, although as aforementioned it WAS clean, we cannot stress enough how SMALL it is. We had to use the bathroom for storage! No place to keep case etc. Also, the beds are quite small...suitable for 2 girls 5ft 5 and under however, this would have been VERY uncomfortable if any taller. Also, there is absolutely NO PRIVACY in this room – sliding doors ensured that an aspect of the shower/toilet was always exposed no matter what you did with the door or shower curtain. There was nowhere to sit where you could avoid seeing the other person in the shower! Overall, we have given this an ‘average’ rating due to the fact that we seemed to get the room at a reasonable price (as we booked early) however, had we paid any more, this room would have been disappointing, almost unacceptable. We are not naive – have travelled to many places in Europe and America before and were fully aware that space would be of a premium in Manhattan. However, we still feel that this was over priced for what was essentially a youth hostel room. If you are intending to spend more than 3 days in Manhattan we suggest you look elsewhere as the room will ‘get to you’ in the end! We spent bare minimum time in the room – essentially 2 hours a day – and still found it claustrophobic. We suggest paying a little more if it will guarantee a larger room.","Manchester, United Kingdom",2,3.0

So I booked the Pod Hotel warily. But it was great! It felt like a fancy hostel, but that is a positive spin - and much how they advertise themselves. Everything was clean, new, and well-kempt. And the room is tiny and everything is tight. I doubt 2 people could function in the room I was in, but for just me, it worked great. And it had nice-hotel amenities, like a place to hang clothes, shower samples, and even an electronic safe! It could be occasionally loud, but I was there over a weekend and had no complaints. I never like the East Side much because everything closes earlier than the West Side and there's not much to do/see, and that was still true here. But it's a short easy walk over to the Times Square area, and you pass the fun shopping streets on the way. Plus, it was within a couple blocks of the 4,5,6 line, so I could get downtown via subway easily enough. I was a bit isolated when I wanted dinner in my room late one night (I ended up grabbing salty snacks at a bodega) but I didn't feel like I was very far from anywhere else I wanted to go.I was there in February, and it was pretty chilly, with freezing rain and snow most days. But the heat worked great, and occasionally I even had to crack the windows when I overdid it!I didn't use any of the cafes, or restaurants, or check out the roof - or really do any of the hostel-like social things you do, but I was there on business and my days were booked solid, and my nights were spent with old friends. I'm sure that's all great too.Again, if you're looking for a luxurious room to lie around in, Pod Hotel is not for you. But when you're visiting NYC you really just want a place to dump your suitcase and sleep off the party for a few hours each night. Totally recommend this hotel, and would stay here again. The only lack of 5 stars from me is because the location isn't 100% ideal, in my opinion, for where I normally go in NYC.","Berkeley, California",16,4.0

We stayed in the room with a bunk bed and shared bathroom. The room was tiny but neat and clean with all basic amenities. The shared bathrooms were kept very clean and were always available. A you should not stay in this hotel if you are traveling with family or have too much luggage as the rooms are really tiny. For us it was perfect as we were going to be out all day and just needed a place to crash in the night.Loved the roof top deck. You could sit there with some beer and enjoy the view of the city at night. The garden breakfast place was also nice. Their menu offered little treats from various famous stores of NYC, for example bread and scones from Balthazar, a cheese board from Murray's, bagels from Ess-a-bagel, etc. The location of this hotel is very good. The subway is close by and you can walk to a lot of places.They could have done a bit more decor wise in the rooms.

I booked on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed.Given the very reasonable prices, I booked a Queen size room with ensuite. While the room is small (not by New York standards I guess), the storage solutions are clever and I had fantastic natural light on both south and westerly aspects. The ensuite bathroom was 'small but perfectly formed' with subway tiles and chrome fittings. If you're in New York, you shouldn't spend much time in your room so it suited me perfectly.The lifts can be a bit crowded and temperamental but the music makes up for it.Great location - bars, restaurants to suit all budgets, gentrified pubs, convenience stores, two subway locations and an easy walk to 5th Avenue. I was there for St Patricks day and the surrounding Irish pub (of which there are many) made for a festive feeling in the area. Value - this is possibly the best value in NYC. I have spent 3 times what I paid here for a similar sized room in midtown. While most of the rooms are bunk style with shared bathrooms, if you get a room with an ensuite then you're getting the best deal in the city.Staff can be temperamental - concierge is great but reception staff are a little slack and a little cold.Will recommend this to anybody I know heading to the Big Apple!","Middle Park, Australia",26,5.0

The beer garden on the ground floor was really pretty and nice to relax in with a drink post sight-seeing; the roof bar wasn't open when we were there.

I'd looked at it before on several occasions and always thought it might be an interesting change.It's main plus point is the location: midtown east, a walkable distance from several subway lines, museums, Times Square, Central Park and many other things as a tourist you will want to see. I had to be in Times Square most of the time during my stay and the convenience of being able to walk crosstown (even in 100 degree heat) was great, especially since they got rid of the 1 day transit pass. It's also close to a Duane Reede for all those bits and bobs you always seem to need.The room itself I was a little disappointed with. I knew it would be small, but had hoped for some sort of interesting decor or nifty space saving tricks to make up for it. Mostly, it felt like a prison cell with a colourful duvet. Furnishings looked worn, the air-conditioning, like someone else mentioned, is covered by a huge metal grate that blocks most of the air, and in my case wouldn't open for you to be able to switch it on. Others must have had this problem as the only solution appeared to be pulling off the covering entirely. Dusty and gross. The bathrooms were quite a walk around the corridor and though decorated tastefully, were absolutely tiny, with no hooks or shelves for you to put your clothes on. They also flooded when you used them making getting dressed again kind of difficult. Also the temperature control was a bit off, and in trying to adjust it, the knob fell off in my hand. The shampoo and body wash provided was nice though.All staff members I interacted with were friendly and helpful, and I liked the decor in reception. The restaurant menu also looked nice but I didn't eat there. It was way too hot when I was there to hang out on the roof terrace (accessible only via a steep staircase on the 14th floor) but it has nice views and is worth checking out just to take some pictures.My room faced inward so was very quiet away from the traffic, although despite my ""do not disturb"" sign, housekeeping were noisily hoovering away and chatting loudly in spanish outside my door from 9am.I know NY hotels are just expensive, period, but I feel that the Pod was a little overpriced for what I got and though I enjoyed my stay based on how helpful the location was for what I needed, if I had to stay longer than a few nights the annoying things would probably start to grate on me.

The safe was quite unusual and didn't hold much (for 2 people anyway) as everything had to go in upright. The shared bathrooms were good they were always clean and one was always free. In every room there is a indicator to tell which one is free (see photo). It felt to me more like an upmarket hostel, more than a hotel.

The Pod Hotel is a good option. Centrally located to all the world famous sights. Everything is in walking distance and the subway is just around the corner.

The service at the hotel was good, from the bell captain to the reception and even the friendly cleaning crew. Plus the roof top terrace is a nice option. Sadly, no bar up there. Food for thought.The rooms were a lot smaller than they appeared on the usual hotel booking websites. For two people, the room and the bathroom was quite tiny. But then again, when in New York, spend as much time as possible outdoors. One problem is though, everyone else is doing it as well. Most of the rooms on the floor had shared bathrooms/showers per floor. This meant that the other guests returning from their parties made quite a lot of noise when using the facilities. In addition a lot of the high rise buildings near by have massive air condition vents which run all day and night. This hinders the quality of sleep. But then again, you're not in new york to sleep.

I paid $1645 for 10 nights, which for NYC is VERY reasonable.My room was small, but i knew that because i booked it! (People reading/writing reviews take note!) But i found it very satisfactory, and the beds were very comfortable. There were 10 power outlets/plug sockets in the room so if you have many electronics with you, you're in safe hands. There is also free, unlimited WI-Fi, which is very quick! I didn't bother with my air-con, so ican't say how effective it is but my room was never too hot or too cold. The window opened all the way, but there were no curtains, just a pair of slatted Shutters.There are 4 bathrooms on each floor, 3 of which are rather small but one is large with plenty of room. All bathrooms are very clean, the showers are powerful and the water is nice and hot!I found all the staff very friendly, attentive and helpful. Especially the concierge and front desk.

On arrival we had to give our credit card details (which is pretty average where ever you stay) and we were given our room keys (cards). We were told we had been given a complementary upgrade. WOW!!!! My friend and I were really excited about this as we were prepared for the shared bathroom and brought shower shoes. We had booked into a bunk pod and we were lucky enough to be given one of the refurbished rooms. The beds were comfy with enough bedding. The room was small but no smaller than a room in Paris. The ensuite was great. Each room comes with your own wash basin and towels. The inroom safe was fantastic and you get to chose your own passcode for this. Our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the back of other buildings. This was also great as we didn't get any street noise (only an outside air conditioner which to be honest didn't bother me after 5 minutes). In the lobby there are 4 ipads on the wall which are free to use. There is a small coffee shop and three lifts. We found all the staff to be really friendly. The ladies who cleaned our room were lovely as were the reception staff. Reception will change up to $100 of travellers cheques per traveller a day which we found to be very handy. The location was also amazing. We were on 51st street. There is a tube stop 2 blocks from the hotel, several small places to eat within a minutes walk from the front door and shops near by.

At mid-morning we arrived in the city. Not expecting that the hotel room would be available that early I was pleasant surprised when I arrived at The Pod to be told that my reservation had been upgraded to a double with in-suite bathroom and that it was ready for me to check-in. The lobby was bright, modish and inviting with a college dorm feel. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. My room was located on the 2nd floor in the back opposite 51st Street making it quiet. On the right wall entering the room was a small stainless enclosed sink with towels in the shelves below with a blow dryer, and a few toiletries. Next to the sink was the small shower with a sliding frosted glass door that served the purpose of both privacy in the glass shower stall and the toilet located next to it at the far wall end. There was a double bed placed sideways, a small table, chair, two wall mounted reading lights on either side of the bed and TV, and an air conditioning unit in the one window. The height or length of the modern showerhead could not be adjusted. The accommodations were tight but practical. The location and value of The Pod Hotel is obviously its draw.

The one thing to remember is that it is designed to be a place to sleep - a base while you're seeing NY. It isn't a boutique spa hotel, the rooms aren't terribly relaxing and it is, quite rightly, a question of function over form, to one degree or another.

Even though I paid extra for more space the room var still very small - nice for a long weekend but a bit claustrophobic for 9 days ... But the design of the room was well thought out which somehow compensated for the lack of space. Only set back was that whenever I opened the windows to get some fresh air into my little room, the place would instantly start to smell of fried food from a near by restaurant...One very annoying thing though was that when I booked the room online I had to provide my credit card details. So I did but when I checked in, they blocked the full amount on my card even though I told them I was planning to pay in cash - which I ended up doing. The result was that my credit card (visa) is now temporarily (for 1 month!) closed because it has reached the limit for international transactions (which is why I planned to pay in cash).

The hotel is close to all the main attractions such as Times Square, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center etc and there's also a subway station up the road which is really useful - we used it to visit the WTC site and SoHo/China Town.It's also close to lots of restaurants, takeaway shops and there's a supermarket on the corner which we used regularly and is reasonably priced. The room itself is perfect if you're looking to be outside all day. Although it's small in size, there is plenty of room to store your belongings and the shower cubicle is a big enough. We found the hotel to be very quiet, although busy. Guests and staff were all very friendly, the bell boy in particular was extremely helpful when there was a mix up with our transfer back to the airport (he told us how to get a refund and booked us a cab instead).We hope to visit New York again and when we do we'll definitely be staying at The Pod - overall it's a great location and great value for money.","Sunderland, United Kingdom",5,5.0

It was our first time in NYC and overall we were quite pleased with our experience. Our room and private bath were spotless, spacious, and very well-kept. All of the furniture was in excellent condition and the bed was comfortable. We were glad to have free Wi-Fi (with a fairly quick connection) and a small flat-screen TV in the room. We were on the fifth floor, so we did not hear any noise from the street. Best of all, the hotel was located in a safe and well-travelled neighbourhood, only a short walk away from two subway stations (51st Street, and 53rd St - Lexington Ave), a 24-hour Duane Reade pharmacy, some fantastic shopping areas, and many cafes and restaurants. All of the tourist attractions (e.g., Times Square) were easily accessible by subway. At night, the streets around the hotel were quite lively -- people were walking about at all hours. For healthy breakfasts, fruit, and sandwiches, we typically stopped off at the Pax at the corner of 51st and 3rd Ave. We mostly ate elsewhere in the city, but one evening we had dinner at Thai 51, which was only a couple doors down from the hotel, and we were impressed by the quality of the food. I would highly recommend this hotel. It was so easy to get around and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.","Ontario, Canada",60,4.0

I travel to NYC regularly and have stayed at many hotels around the city. Always wanted to try the Pod Hotel because I like small spaces and it seemed fun, hip and modern based on the website. In reality, this is a low-grade hostel pretending to be a hotel and charging way too much for what you get. There is nothing budget about the prices of the rooms, except maybe for the single rooms with hall bathroom access. You can stay at much nicer, full-service hotels for a similar price so there is no big savings benefit of staying here. Biggest problem we had with this hotel: you cannot control the temperature in your room. During the unseasonably cold weekend we just experienced, we literally could see our own breath in the room once the temps dropped that night. They do not provide space heaters or turn the heat on manually, so we literally froze all night. It was very much like staying in a dorm where you freeze during the cooler months because the heat only comes on once its literally freezing outside. I think this is completely unacceptable when you're paying $200-300 a night for a room. Other problems we had: 1. the bellman arranged for a car and said the flat rate was $35 but didn't mention extra charges for using a credit card, even though I specifically asked about credit card use, 2. bed and pillows were extremely firm to the point of feeling like I slept on a floor all night, and 3. no hot water! Per the maintenance guy, the pipes are not insulated so if a room is vacant for a day, the water becomes very cold and you have to run the water until it flushes out the cold water. It took at least 10 minutes to get warm water, which is a huge waste of water. He told us the trick was to turn on the shower and sink faucet and let them run, which is insane. Not eco-friendly and what guest should have to run the water for such excessive times just to wash their face?! The wi-fi was also not working properly Tuesday morning so I couldn't check-in for my flight when I wanted to. And beware that there is also no insulation between rooms so you will also hear everyone on the hall and everything they are doing. After dealing with little sleep (due to noise and the temperature), freezing conditions, hard bed, spotty wi-fi, and cold water, I was very upset that I had booked this hotel. I honestly feel that I should not have had to pay for this stay as it was unacceptable in every way possible. I wanted to speak with the general manager upon check-out but was only given the general hotel e-mail address as a means of contacting him. All around an unacceptable experience and money very poorly spent.","Greensboro, North Carolina",26,2.0

The bathrooms were modern, clean and, as stated in other reviews, the rainfall showerhead was awesome. (We were in the city for a 1/2 Marathon, so this was perfect after the long race!) The room was small, but what I expected. It was nice to have a sink in the room. My only minor complaints would be that the air conditioning was not particularly strong, and it was a warm weekend.

The room was very clean and we never had any hold up on getting into one of the shared bathrooms. there is a monitor in your room telling you which of the four bathrooms someone was in. They were never full. Two of them were right across from our room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is a beautiful waterfall/garden oasis across the street where we had lunch one day and that was really nice.

Just ask, and they send it right away! I really have nothing bad to say about this place. Also, I love the rain head shower! I think I took unneccessary showers just to use it again. It was awesome!

However, the room I had was tiny-- the bed was up against a wall on one side and about two feet from the other wall, and I am not exaggerating when I say that the bathroom was about the size of an airplane bathroom, and the shower was about the size of a telephone booth (for those under 30 who don't know what a telephone booth is, it is about 2 feet square, just enough room to turn around in.) On the commode I had to embrace a pillar in the wall if I didn't want to sit sideways. Also, for no apparent reason, there was a clear window in the bathroom wall which allows anyone in the room to see into the bathroom, even when the door is closed. You better be on very friendly terms with your roommate. The hotel is located in a nice, but sleepy section of Manhattan. No night scene in this part of east midtown.

Sometime in the late '90's it went through a modern facelift which given the limits of the architecture, is a well designed upgrade that includes stainless steel fixtures & a wall safe in each room. Generally the rooms still remain small(Pods). Rooms with shared washrooms are not a problem since there are four per floor along with ""vacant/occupied"" indicator lights in the rooms. The hotel is clean. The hotel location is very good being close to north/south & east/west subway/bus lines, & with many restaurants & bars nearby. there is also a good french wine bar on the ground level of the hotel. Hotel prices vary depending on the day of the week & the season, but for New York I think its fare value. I suggest booking early.On the negative side, even though there is free Wi-Fi, in the room that I had it was totally frustrating to use, since the signal kept getting lost, sometimes when I was in the middle of emailing or researching. If you expect to have late evenings, the morning noise from the hallways can be a problem for sleep. You can hear all the conversations from the hallway plus the cleaners start early so the sound of a vacuum penetrates the room.

It was! I have been going to NYC on biz for many years and tried this as an alternative to the usuals of the Waldorf, Intercontinental or Marriott Marquis.Let your friends and associates rib you about the size, because a queen sized bed in a nice hotel in midtown for $100 is impossible - until the Pod. Yes, the rooms are small, but I realized that it's the same thing as a good stateroom on a cruise, which is what it's like. If you can do a week-long cruise in a room this size, why not a night or two in the city?I found my queen room to be quite comfortable. Everything is new and updated, and decorated sort of like you slept over at Ikea. Desk was small, but workable. Wireless access was decent. Sheets were crisp and bed and pillows were comfortable. My room had two windows, so was quite bright and nice. Heater controls all worked well.In the bathroom, the water pressure is good and the water was hot. My only complaint was that the shower head is located directly overhead in the dead center of the shower stall, so it was hard to get out of the spray to shave or soap down. Lighting in the room and bathroom were also both good.The lobby is small, but has iPads on the wall to look things up or get directions. The lobby bar, which serves only wine and beer, had some very nice wine selections.Location is good, 51st between 2nd and 3rd. It's a quieter street (for New York). There are plenty of restaurant and bar options close by and cabs are plentiful on 2nd or 3rd, depending which way you are going.Front desk staff is about average for a New York hotel (read that to mean helpful, but not exactly friendly). I also didn't think the Pod was any noisier, or really an quieter for that matter, than any other NYC hotel where people on vacation or business might be coming and going late or early. So you can get awakened by hallway noise in a really expensive hotel, or a less expensive one - your choice.

I traveled solo this time. I booked directly thru their website about a month earlier and got a fantastic rate on a ""double pod"" with in-room bathroom (I don't like that shared bathroom thing; I've done it before and hated it). My room was on the 8th floor. This hotel has a ""retro-mod"" decor throughout with offbeat music playing throughout including hallways. The rooms are minimalistic, just what you need and nothing more so - no - 1000 count luxury bedding, no decor or anything like that - a simple no frills room. For the record, I'm a man in his 40's and there were all age groups staying here - it’s not a young hipster only hotel as marketed!I'm dividing this review into positives and negatives for an easier read: Positives:- fantastic rate (off season, January, in middle of winter, almost 1/2 of other NYC hotels in area)- great location (for me anyways) subways were about 2-3 blocks away including the ""E"" train that takes your from/to JFK airport and also takes you to the 9/11 Memorial (breathtaking is all I can say about it about memorial). Hotel is on Mid-town East- Lexington Avenue (3 blocks away) has a lot of big name and boutique stores for those shoppers out there and - yes - a few Starbucks around- tons of restaurants close by and drug stores too. Good food up the block at an eatery called ""Pax."" Also a really good upscale ""food court"" under the Citigroup Centre building (the ultra modern slanted roof building) on Lexington Ave & 53 st ( 3 blocks away)- yes the rooms are very small but have Wi-Fi, iPod connection on clock radio, large drawers under platform bed, bed mattress is firm but comfortable, bathroom has ""rainfall"" shower-head - very relaxing, a very small flat screen TV. Luckily no problem with heating since it was in the 20’s-30’s outside- rooms are extremely clean and impeccably maintained- if you are a walker, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Grand Central Station, MoMa are minutes away- there is a cafe in lobby, think of it as a micro Starbucks but you have to pay for everything even if you are a guest - nothing complimentary- on site concierge- they will hold your bags if you are early or even after you leave to pick up later- Wi-Fi in lobby - rooms have a safeNegatives:- front desk staff is indifferent and cold, barely any eye contact, probably will get more emotion out of a computer - i.e. asked if there is an in house restaurant, front desk women simply said a stern 'no"" and told me go next door ( no eye contact at all)...ummm next door is a French restaurant!- in room ""bathroom"" layout is bizarre with zero privacy - see thru glass ""wall"" dividing shower from room with only a sliding frosted glass door to offer any privacy when taking a shower or using toilet - not both. Obviously this bathroom space was a closet before due to location and size. Toilet directly faces shower in a very small space. A stainless steel sink that is very small is outside in room (think the size of a sink in an airplane)- room is very small, really designed for one person, two will find it uncomfortable and that no-privacy bathroom will become a major issue- no in-house restaurant- rooms are not well insulated so you will hear doors slamming and people talking in hallway (luckily I was in a quiet area away from elevators and shared bathrooms)- no in-room refrigerator, no ice machines on floors- pillows are rather thin but you can ask for more pillows- full size bed is sideways in double room and the padded backboard is actually the side board makes it a bit of a challenge to watch TV.Overall, if you are a no frills solo traveler this will make a great hotel to stay at. If you are a family or a group of friends attempting to share a room, I would seriously recommend against it - you will hate it - rooms are way too small and design of room is non-conventional with no privacy.I liked it a lot because of value, location and hotel/rooms are impeccably maintained and I found them cozy.

I am in my mid 30s and I travelled with a girlfriend. We were basically looking for a cheap and clean place that was in a central location. I have to say that the Pod certainly delivered on all accounts and surpased my expectations in others. Like many have said, it is tiny. We stayed in a bunk room and there really was not much room, but the bed was comfy enough and both our suitcases fit with no problem (and my friend had a massive one beceause she meeting me a from a trip to Vegas). I, also like others, was worried about the bathrooms, but I was not freaked at all when I got there. They were super clean, very modern and I dug the music. Oh, and I brought cheap flip flops which helped put my mind at ease. Neither of us had to wait ever. The little lights above the door let you know if there are free bathrooms and there always was whevever I looked. I though the service here was impeccable. The concierage was so knowledgeble. He gave us awesome advice on what shows to see and were to eat, which was key because I find food in NYC hit and miss. BUT if you know where to go, there are tons of great places to eat. He even made all of our reservations. I also loved loved loved the little cafe and outdoor seating area. Very funky. I enjoyed sitting and planning out my day with my coffee and scone. The wifi worked great out there. We were there for 4 nights and we really were only at the hotel first thing in the morning and then we would come back late at night. One evening we grabbed slices of pizza and beer from a little place around the corner and went up to the rooftop patio. That was a highlight for me as well. Great view. There are lots of little pubs within walking distance as well if you want a night cap. We walked to TSquare and Central park and to shopping on 5th, no problem, but in the evening it was not as straight forward to get subways back from downtown because the line that is right outside the hotel only ran until early evening and we were often out until much later. Not a big deal, and it is possible that there was another line and we missed it. Neither one of us is very good at figuring out subway systems. Oh, and we had a room on the 3rd floor which was great because we could walk up the stairs instead of waiting for the elevators. There often seemed to be big groups waiting for the elevators.

Affordable, space efficient accommodation in a great NYC location. Anyone that complains about it being too small can't have read too much about the hotel. It never professes to be large or extravagant and you don't need it to be. I suspect if you were staying for an extended period of time you might get sick of not having quite as much room, but I stayed here for 2 nights and was perfectly happy.You get a comfortable bed, some under bed storage, toilet, sink, hairdryer, TV and usually a desk and chair. I would definitely recommend a private bathroom but by all reports the share bathrooms are clean and your in room screen tells you when they are available. I had originally booked a shared bath but after a long trip asked for an upgrade and was prepared to pay the difference. I was given the upgrade at no extra cost! Wonderful service.I was on the 8th floor and had a wonderful view of the city from my window. Couldn't have wanted more!Just down the street (towards 3rd Ave) is a Pax Wholesale Foods which sells great fresh food, sandwiches, fruit and pastas for a healthy alternative!The Pod also has free wifi, which is a big win - other hotels charge $10 for 24 hours!There are 2 nearby subway stations and it would probably take you 10 minutes to walk to 5th Ave. It is also in a great location, out of the way of all the rush of Times Square.Will definitely stay here again.

I can *strongly* recommend it to travelers, especially patients coming into NYC to visit doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering - the 53rd St. physicans offices are two blocks away, and the subway uptown to the main campus hospital is also only two blocks away (or you can take the MSKCC free jitney bus.) The Pod has everything you will need - you can go ultra cheap in a room with a shared bath (clean, clean, clean!) or spend just a bit more (avg. around $119) for a double bed ""pod"" (room) with in-room bath and shower. Furnishings and bed are comfortable, minimal but exactly what is needed. And all of the rooms have FREE wireless...a huge plus and hard to get in much higher priced NYC hotels. The Pod also has added a cafe downstairs for coffee, tea, pastries - and it's surrounded by excellent restaurants within a two-block radius. It's a perfect hub for any vacationer, and a restful place for people in the city for health checkups or on business.The only negative - the halls are a bit dark, the elevators can be slow.

I booked a single room with shared bathroom. The hotel was clean and modern, sure the room is small-but what do you expect from a place called 'The Pod Hotel'?. If you want to stay in Manhattan (and only plan on using the room as a place to crash after all your sight seeing etc) but are scared off by the prices of the other hotels, this is a good option. The bed was comfortable, pillow on the first night was small and thin and not of much use really but I left a note for housekeeping the next morning with a tip and was pleased to find another two pillows (which were thicker etc than the one I had). There are lights above the door to tell you which bathrooms are free, there is pretty much always more than one free. And there are enough to service all the people on the floor. The bathrooms were always clean, and two of them also had two extra water jets that hit you in the lower back when you turned them on-nice! There is also a sink in your room with soap etc so you only really need the bathrooms for the toilet and shower.There is also a TV, Desk, Telephone and ipod docking station/clock in the room. It is also easy to adjust the heating/air con in the room if the temperature isn't to your satisfaction. And there is a stand for your suitcase behind the door which is handy, and keeps it out of your way to a degree-which is important considering the size of the room. Basically they manage the space well in the room.The location is very central, and only a short walk to the Subway.Concerned about safety? There is a fire station AND a police station on the same street!Very close to lot's of places to grab a bite to eat, Pax up on the corner offers a great range of sandwiches, soups, pasta, breakfast etc.The staff were friendly and happy to help when needed.

Everything was well designed, very clean, modern and funky. Boyf and I initially laughed at the size of the room when we first opened the door but once we had organised our suitcases and sorted ourselves out we found the bed to actually be pretty comfy, it wasn't to noisy and the shower was excellent.

I arrived in NYC, a young adult traveling after 30 hours of flying hoping to quickly check in to The Pod - first thing, check! The service was quick and efficient. I booked a single room with a shared bathroom - which to my knowledge was only to have a single bed and small desk. I was only staying for 2 nights waiting some fellow friends to arrive in NYC so I did not need much. I was very impressed with the room - although it was very small, in all honesty I did not need much more. I was able to hang up a few coats, spread out on my reasonably sized bed, had a sink and watch a bit of TV before crashing for 12 hours like planned. The wifi was slightly slow but worked out nicely in the end. The bathroom was down the hall - and was amazing. I have never had a better shower in my life! The shared bathroom was not at all as I imagined, it was very impressive. In terms of location, it was just what I needed. Close to a few restaurants and cafes, one down the road that does quick sandwiches, salads and pastas - and close to Times Square and other main attractions. I did not experience much else of the hotel as I spent a large amount of my time getting over jet-lag. Overall, for what I needed I am very happy to give The Pod a 4/5. Many might say it was small, but to be honest, in a city like New York - who is going to the spend the day and night in their room?","Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",3,4.0

There were wonderful restaurants next door and within a block of the hotel including French, Thai, Japanese and Italian. The lobby was stylishly decorated and there was a small cafe in the lobby which served affordable breakfast, light snacks and wine all day. The check-in process was seamless, and they allowed me to check in at 1 pm on a Friday afternoon. I had a single room with a sink, desk, flat screen TV and a twin bed. It was very clean. There was storage under the bed and a small closet. The room even had an in-room safe to store your valuables. There were 4 shared bathrooms on each floor. Each bathroom was locked with a dead bolt, and had a sink, toilet and rainfall shower. They provided shower gel and shampoo in dispensers in the shower. I never had a problem finding an empty bathroom and they were clean and tidy every time I used them. I would suggest bringing shower shoes though, since you have to carry your towels and bath mat from your room to the bathroom when you take a shower.

We had a bunk bed room and shared facilities and for myself and traveling partner it just added to the whole experience. The room was not the biggest but it made us be more organised with storage of shopping (of which there was alot!). As we were there to soak up what NYC had to offer we didnt spend that much time in the room as we were out and about each bunk had a TV that was independent of each other so both bunks could watch seperate channels, the beds were very comfortable and sturdy not your stereotyipcal bunk beds!.The conserige Brian was very helpful assiting us in getting discounts for trips like 'sex in the city tour and also invaluable at helping us save time by directing us and informing us of Metro times and stations. The beds were changed daily and the room was clean fresh towels were also supplied daily, there is a light system above the door which indicates when rooms were free. The only recomendation i would give to the POD for improvement would be more coat hooks on the back of doors and maybe some shelves in case like myself you are a keen shopper and require somewher to store purchased items. Location wise the POD is very good walking distance to everywhere and there are some restaurants and Bars near by we ate in the italian which the name escapes me but it was on the main road around the corner fro the POD and the food was lovely, we also ate at the Manchester pub which was great pub food and have entertainment on most eveinings there wings are lovely and there is a welcoming atmosphere. I would recomend people to stay in the POD if they are couples or freinds and want a conveinient place to sleep before enjoying all NYC has to offer if you want to stay in and watch TV and relax this is not the place for you as i feel the compact nature of the POD is for conveinence not for a leisurely holiday, however for those that are after this i feel NYC wouldnt be the best place to have a holiday.","London, United Kingdom",20,4.0

Well, I must have been a very lucky girl. In NY, I had a truly amazing once in a lifetime experience! Having returned home, life was never quite the same again. Pod, had well served its purpose.A friend had recommended that I check out this budget hotel which was very centrally located in NY, called the Pod Hotel. ""Pod"" - I wondered, what a strange name. I was sceptical as with all first-timers. IThe room is, as most people have commented, pretty tiny! I wasn't fussed, I was a single traveller afterall. And besides, being in NY, the last thing you would want to do is to spend time in the hotel. There is just so much more out there. You could be in NY for months and still not have fully explored the entire city!I chose the single Pod which was pretty self-sufficient on its own, paid about U$170nett per night. Shared bathrooms were fine for me (as I said, I'm not too fussed), there were about 4 units per floor, and in every room there would be an indicator just above the door which showed a red light if the bathroom was occupied. Strategically located, the subway is just a block away from Pod. Everywhere is accessible in NY on foot or by the yellow cab or subway, it is impossible to get lost (well, almost). When in NY, walk as much as you can and one of the joys I had was getting lost in this vibrant city (oops)!I enjoyed every minute I was there, and I know I will be back for sure., hopefully, it won't be long from now, for I left my heart there.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",42,4.0

We're not extremely fussy about hotels, apart from having something clean, simple and with good service. This hotel came out top in all three of those qualities. The only problem I can mention is the fact the room we had was a little small. (by the way, we stayed in the bunkbed room, think it's called twin pod or something similar).Now, on to the showers/bathrooms- at first I was a little worried about having to share the shower room and walk down the corridor for it, but in the end this was not a problem whatsoever. We never needed to wait for a free shower and it tells you when they are free from a panel in your room. Also, they were cleaned extremely regularly and the shower rooms were always spotless. One great perk to this hotel is the roof terrace. It's got a nice view and a certain relaxing charm to it.

The only color in the room is the bed spread and it was very different from online, not as fun of colors. I noticed many design flaws with the room, which seems odd since there seems to be a focus on maximizing minimal space. I booked a double room. The bathroom offers very little visual and sound privacy so it would be an uncomfortable room to share with another person. Some flaws - The room lacked a full-length mirror even though there is wall space for one. There are no hooks for towels near the sink. The sink area is all metal with a very small basin; whenever I washed my hands, face, etc., water got all over the area and then dried in a way that left a pattern. Basically, the sink always looked dirty. There is a space to store stuff in the open closet. A three-sided wooden thing offers storage on top. Underneath, an average-sized suitcase is about 2"" too tall to fit under it. Considering there is not a lot of room to put a suitcase, this seems like wasted space. The only place to put a suitcase so it's out of the way is vertically between the bed and window. There are some drawers under the bed, which is a good use of space. The TV directly faces an area where there is nowhere to sit. It is viewable from the bed or desk chair, but I was surprised to find that the TV did not swivel. This would be a good feature. The pillows were very thin and not comfortable at all. I did find the shower to be pleasant, although it's not possible to adjust the water pressure. In my room there was a small desk and chair, which was fine. It is a chair with a criss-cross metal back that is a little bit uncomfortable to lean against, but it's not too bad. I noticed a lot of noise from the hallway; I was awoken several times in the morning and the people weren't shouting or anything. I'd recommend bringing ear plugs. I paid $220 a night for a mid-November visit. I feel like this is a little bit high considering the size of the room and design flaws.Positives - My room was very clean. The staff was friendly enough. Free WiFi. If you are looking for a budget hotel, I'm sure you could do worse. Personally, I don't see myself staying here again.","Tempe, Arizona",9,3.0

Now I'll admit that I was disappointed at first, and wondering if I had made a huge mistake. But most of that was due to the A/C not working in my room. Even in early November, the humidity was stifling, and other parts of the hotel were even worse, such as the bathrooms.But once the A/C was fixed two days later, my perception of The Pod Hotel changed for the better. I appreciated its convenient location mid-town near the subway stops for the 6, E, and M trains. The room was not spotless, but reasonably clean. Yes the rooms are small, and unless you book one of the larger rooms with the en-suite bathrooms I would not recommend it for anything other than a solo traveler. I had my doubts about the shared bathroom facilities but I never had to wait as there are 4 on each floor and above your room door are lights to let you know which ones are occupied. Except for wet floors left by the previous and inconsiderate guest, the bathrooms are in good condition. Note that that on my floor (9th) bathroom #4 has a window which is fixed in the open position, exposing your naked body to windows on the opposite side of the building. I do not know if this is the case on other floors.As I did not need to leave Manhattan until well after checkout, they graciously allowed me to leave my luggage with them during the day. You get a claim check so nobody walks off with your suitcase.Besides the room size, another negative is that the hotel does not have an ice machine. However they do have a vending machine (Coke products only) and there are numerous cafes within walking distance. I highly recommend Pax on 51st and 3rd Av, 1/2 block from the hotel and on the way to/from the nearest subway stops.Some reviewers complained about noise but I did not find that to be problematic, and my room was near the elevator and bathrooms. I would occasionally hear a loudly talking person in the hallway, but I still slept very well.I would recommend this hotel ,but with caveats. If you can tolerate the sleeping compartment of an Amtrak train, it won't be a problem for you. But if you need a spacious room, you won't like it one bit.","Los Angeles, California",51,4.0

The pillows were far too thin even for someone who doesn’t like high pillows. Heating in the room worked on a cycle system but temperature control was a problem often being too hot for the small room or too cool overnight with the thin blankets. The elevators are frequently full and the lobby always had many people milling about.

The shared bathrooms were always readily available and in good order. They also have an open rooftop which made for a unique dinner one evening!

You can also go to the roof top to shoot pictures or hang around if the weather is good. The bathrooms were clean, not really a problem being shared. There are lights in the rooms that show occupancy. Some of the guests though are pigs to say the least, yet it is not a fault of the hotel.The hallways and doors can be noisy, and again the guests are often not thinking of others by talking loudly outside their rooms at 3 in the morning. The hotel should at least have a guest rule list at check in . Free wi fi that works very well, and mounted iPads in the lobby for those needing a remote computer.

Coming in from JFK via subway, the hotel was conveniently placed - a very short distance from the subway stop and in a bustling and central NYC location. The rooms at the Pod are quite small (as detailled on the website) but they are so creatively put together, the rooms come off as cute and compact as opposed to cramped. However, I did only stay for one night. Perhaps longer stays would find the lack of space frustrating. The room I stayed in had two bunks, a sink, good air conditioning, televisions and a hairdryer. The showers/bathrooms were down the corridor but I did not experience any waiting. The toilet/shower facilities themselves were great: good, hot water with a strong pressure. Bathrooms were very clean - as were the bedrooms.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel. It is very reasonably priced for New York and the design of the place is really interesting. My only mild complaints are the brisk attitude of the reception staff and the cafe workers. I was also asked to pay a $30 deposit which was returned to me on vacation of the room. I felt this was unnecessary and frustrating as I had not been told about this when I booked online and had to run to an ATM machine, exhausted after a long-haul flight. Some consideration from the reception staff would have been nice to make me feel more welcome, but this is a mild concern.

The toilet occupancy lights inside the room are a unique and interesting feature.The view from the rooftop is quite nice and a good place to meet other travellers.For breakfast you can either have it in the hotel terrace or go to one of the many breakfast joints nearby. My favorite place was definitively the little park across the street where they built a waterfall in order to keep the city noise away.

It's slightly east of the major areas of NYC but it's easily within walking distance of Rockefeller Centre and many other similar attractions. There is a subway nearby too and plenty of restaurants and bars too!ROOMSWe stayed in a good sized room. I'd heard that the rooms could be small but, based on prior experience, our room was much larger than previous NYC hotels that I've stayed in. Our room had a lot of storage and plenty of hangers, drawers, etc as well as a little balcony and a small writing desk. The beds were really comfortable and I had some of the best nights sleep I have had in hotels. There were fresh towels everyday as well as a face cloth per person and a hand towel. The only downside was the bathroom which didn't afford the privacy I would have liked to have had considering I was with my brother and a male friend. The door, a sliding frosted glass door, covered the shower (a good shower with plenty of hot water) while showering but not the toilet area which meant you had to step out into the toilet area, pull the shower curtain closed again and the pull the door along to get dried off. However, the shower curtain was white so was slightly see through (the screen on the shower was clear glass). This I didn't like and it wasn't really a fun experience. Luckily there were communal showers which were more private - I don't see why the glass in the shower couldn't be frosted and then have a sliding door too!MISCAll staff were really helpful and kind and the food in the cafe was reasonably priced and very tasty. I was impressed with the extras like iPads in the lobby and a few other bits and pieces. The cost was good and the hotel was always immaculate which I was pleased about as I find this to be my major priority!Overall, I liked this hotel and I'd definitely go back to it.

This was my first trip to New York City, female traveling solo, on a limited budget. A travel agent recommended the Pod, so I went with her recommendation. First of all, this hotel has a great location. The Waldorf Astoria is just 3 blocks away. The Rockefeller Center is a short walk. Most important, the 51st street subway station is only 2 blocks away, as is the M50 crosstown bus. You really can't get a better location, especially if you plan to use the public transportation. I arrived early, around 11 am, but was immediately given a room, which I appreciated. The room was very small, but it had all that I needed. A platform bed with storage drawers and a ledge all around (serving as a shelf), a desk with a chair, a TV, a wall safe, closet space, and a small sink/vanity area, radio/alarm clock and hair dryer. The hotel supplies the towels (changed daily). The windows have wooden shutters for privacy and can be opened for ventilation if desired. There is a heat and a/c unit, quiet and efficient. Everything was modern, new, and clean. The shared bathrooms were not at all a problem. It's not a gym-like situation like I envisioned. We had 3 bathrooms on our floor, and each bathroom has a toilet, a sink, and a shower. When you are there, you lock yourself in and the bathroom is all yours, completely private. The only indication that it's ""shared"" is when you find the shower or sink wet. I always used the bathroom closest to my room and used the other two only out of curiosity. They were not identical but generally the same. All the bathrooms were modern, spotless, and well vented. No problems at all with the shared arrangement. All the showers had rain showers (shower from ceiling rather than from the wall) which I am not too crazy about, however, this was a minor issue. I had a corner room which was extremely quiet. Since I am very sensitive to noise, this aspect alone would earn the hotel high praise in my book. The convenience of an in-room safe was also appreciated. An additional bonus was a great place to eat which is only half a block and around the corner away, Morning Star Cafe at 949 Second Avenue. I ate there every day and the qualify of their food would do a much more expensive restaurant proud. For a salad, a main course, and a glass of wine I usually paid less than $20 (including the tip). This was a great value and I enjoyed all the meals I ate there and would highly recommend this place to those who appreciate good food. The hotel has a small bistro downstairs where you can have snacks or drinks. I never ate there, so I can't comment. They also have a roof top deck where guests can relax. On my last day I had to leave my luggage with the bellboy after checking out, that went smoothly. Overall, the Pod Hotel is a great place to stay, provided you want basic accommodations and don't expect a lot of frills. It's a great value in a great location. If I ever come to New York again, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.","Central Coast, California",70,5.0

The only time we experienced a wait was first thing in the morning and the longest wait was maybe 5 minutes, which wasn't a problem for us.

It is very well located, being near 2 different subway lines and within walking distance of a several sites (including MOMA and St. Patrick’s). For those with mobility limitations or with luggage, the nearby E line station can be accessed by escalator rather than stairs. There are many restaurants in the area representing a wide range of cuisines and price options, as well as various stores and a lovely, small public park with an artificial waterfall and shaded seating. My room was (as expected) quite small, but it was laid out so efficiently that it did not feel overly cramped to me. In case it matters to you, the bed was a twin. The modern shower had a “rain” showerhead, which I must admit is not to my liking – I prefer an angled spray, but that’s a matter of personal preference.I thought the hotel’s staff and amenities surprisingly comprehensive for the price. My room and all public areas were spotless. Hotel staff were efficient and helpful, and both concierges I met were informative. (Brian was outstanding.) The hotel offers free wifi and the lobby has several touch-pad computers mounted on a column for guests’ use. The “snack” counter (open from early morning until about 10 p.m. if I recall correctly) offered some delicious breakfast options and some wines and beers at reasonable prices (I didn’t pay attention to other choices). Seating was available both indoors and outside in a small, pleasant, urban courtyard. The roof deck also offered a pleasant respite. An aside: There is a bistro just outside the Pod, one you can even enter directly from the Pod - Le Bateau. In the late afternoon, it can be a pleasant place to stop for a drink if you are prepared to pay premium prices. It is open quite late – which is nice – but the later the hour, the louder the music. By late evening, I found the noise decidedly aversive. When I commented on it, Le Bateau staff told me their clients prefer to have the volume of music that high. If you disagree (as do I), please let them know!","Washington, DC",240,5.0

Basically I only wish I would have read 'a very upscale hostel' and 'ok if single or with no intimate boundaries' before booking this hotel.

This ho(s)tel has an interesting range. I was in a single Pod with no bathroom. The best way to describe it: ""There was just enough room for a twin size bed."" If you are clousterphobic, yeah look elsewhere. I only used the Pod for the weekend, and I think that was appropriate anything beyond that I think might be uncomfortable. the size of the room also didn't make it feel clean even tough it seemed decent.  the shades on the window(facing center) were a bit shady. I felt like I could see into other pod's as well as other pods look into my pod. Just have to fix the shade just right so as to feel like you have privacy. The problem is the AC. AC ran fine, I lucked out that it wasn't that hot, but if I had to close my shade and run the AC I think that would have been difficult. You would need to keep the shade open. I liked the fact that there was a (tiny) sink in the room. So I could take a shower in the shared bathroom and finish getting ready in my room. The shared bathroom was decent. Though there was always a musky smell. If you are taller than 5 feet 10 inches, yeah the shared bathroom will probably be uncomfortable for you. The shared bathroom situation is decent. Only one person at a time. And there was always one available while I was there. It was a concern before but fine. The location is key, 10 mintes from Times square and all the great shops on the upper eas side. I got back pretty late (probably like 3am) and felt safe walking from the Metro (a few blocks away.) But I also didn't encounter any multiple parties walking out of all the nearby bars. there was pleny of them when I left the hotel. Hotel validates parking between lexingotn and 3rd. $30 dollars for overnight is pretty good in NYC. But look up best parking, you might be able to snag a metered spot nearby. Oh yeah, and no iron board (no place to put one). Towels are medicore. For ~$200 I am persudaded you can get a better room in another area. But if you don't mind minimalism at it's perfection, $200 is a great price for the location. Taxis aren't bad, I met friends for drinks near the Brooklyn bridge and it only cost ~$12.

However, f you are in New York and worried about how much space your hotel room has, you are clearly spending too much time in it. The location of the Pod is it's real selling point.

As I say in the title this place is basically a very upscale hostel, but its amenities are many so it's well worth it to check out.Yes, the rooms are tiny. My single room was roughly five by eight. If you're in a single or bunk bed room you'll only have a sink. But the bed was comfortable, there's a flat screen TV embedded in the wall, nice cold A/C (the noise didn't bother me since at home I have a fan on so it helped me sleep), drawers in the bed platform to stash your stuff, and free reliable Internet. The corridors are colorful if somewhat dimly lit. As for the common bathrooms everyone seems to freak out about they're rather elegant--very clean and all marble with nice showers (which supply shampoo and shower gel) and stylish sinks. A panel above your room door advises when any of them are occupied, and I never saw all four on my floor occupied at the same time. I must have come on an off week because my floor was very quiet my whole stay. The location is great--two blocks from a subway stop and restaurants, supermarkets, drugstores, liquor stores and a lot of other stores within very easy walking distance. The staff was helpful and pleasant, and the lobby offers a cafe, a nice seating area and a patio. Maid service was efficient and thorough.If you're the type that insists on bringing everything you own on vacation you probably won't like the Pod, but as a solo traveler who never carries more than a backpack the Pod was absolutely perfect for my needs and I would stay here again with no hesitation.","Richmond, Virginia",9,5.0

Also, there's no fridge or microwave, so don't bring food back to the room. There's also no parking, you'll have to find and pay for a nearby garage. They recommend one, but it's not the best price.

I live about 40 minutes outside of the city, so after night out, I tend to want to avoid the hassle of trains and driving and just have a place to stay nearby. The Pod has always fit those needs. Granted, the rooms are small, but they have always been immaculate on EVERY visit to the multiple rooms I have stayed in. The service has always been decent although I can understand other reviewers complaints about the front desk not always being the friendliest. The location is great since it is slightly outside of the tourist areas so it isn't so noisy. One word of advice is that if you are not a single occupant, do not book anything less than the Queen room because even the double beds are too small for two people to sleep comfortably. An additional note of caution is that the rooms with private bathrooms have a glass wall between it and the main part of the room so privacy is not there if you are staying with someone else (not sure why anyone would design something like that!!). You would be better off using the shared bathrooms/showers in the hall if you want privacy, but just make sure the door lock is working properly after you go in. I had one experience where I didn't realize the lock didn't work and had the door opened multiple times on me while showering with a nearly see-through shower curtain! I have also found that the prices vary quite a bit and it can be quite expensive. I have always booked my rooms for between $89.00 (Single Pod) to $149.00 (Double Pod) but the prices have taken a drastic upswing more recently. I tend to book if the prices are lower than other reputable hotels in the city as a frame of reference. It has overall been a very pleasant experience as long as you get a good rate versus other reputable hotel chain rates. Compare prices before you book.",East Brunswick,2,5.0

The location was pretty great, the concept is interesting, the vibe is cool, the bed was comfy, and for one person the space was enough. Additionally, the price was hard to beat. I found the service friendly as well. If you are booking a room without a bathroom there are these lights above your door that tell you which bathrooms are available, which I thought was very cool. My only complaint is about the shared bathrooms; if you are going to have them, please keep them clean. Most times when i went to use them and the toilets were a little dirty or there was water all over the floor. Now I know that you can't control what the guests are doing but checks of the bathrooms more often would be helpful. Also, WHY IS THERE NO AC OR FAN in the bathroom? I was there over a fairly warm weekend and the bathrooms were intolerably hot, especially after someone had showered. Again, these are shared spaces but the steam hung around because the bathrooms aren't well ventilated. Install a fan, enable the doors to be propped open, open the windows, SOMETHING, ANYTHING would be helpful. Ok, rant about the bathrooms is over.

Luckily, we were only staying at the hotel because we didn't want to trek back to Brooklyn after a concert in midtown and only had overnight bags. That said, if you're traveling with anything more than that, please consider booking a larger room. You will be terribly squished otherwise. As far as the shared bathrooms go, they are absolutely fine. I was a bit weary at the thought, but they are clean and plentiful; you won't have to wait your turn, I promise.

It's in Midtown East, so it's far enough away from all the crazy tourists in Times Square (in Midtown West), but close enough to all the major landmarks and transportation (Rockefeller Center, Radio City, Fifth Avenue, and only two blocks from the Subway station).The rooms are small, so definitely worth considering if you're travelling with a large family or people with bigger frames. I have a 5'11"" slim frame, so the twin-size bed in the single pod room was just right for me... if I was any taller or bigger, and I might have had problems. The rooms are very clean, crisp, and modern, and the in-room A/C works quite well. Sharing bathrooms might be an inconvenience to some (4/floor), but I found that they were always clean and stocked with supplies. They're really well done with rainfall showerheads and always stocked dispensers of soap, body wash, and shampoo. You have an ensuite sink, so you only use the restrooms for showers and the toilet.

We are very low maintenance and no frills folks; we just needed a decent place to come back to after a busy NYC day. The problems started with check-in. We arrived early in the morning. The hotel clerk at the front desk would not even look up at us to check us in, and while nobody else was being served, he shuffled papers around and mumbled for 10 minutes while we stood patiently waiting for him to acknowledge us. Once he started to check us in, he advised us that our room was not ready. This was understandable given the time, but he would not advise when it would be ready. It could be 10 a.m., it could be noon, it could be 2 p.m. We asked if the hotel could call us on my cell phone to advise us when the room was ready, as we'd been up since 4 a.m.. He refused, and just kept repeating the same thing over and over. We tried to be good humoured about it, and just left our bags with the concierge and went out to explore the city until 2 p.m. Once we checked in the room was fine - fairly clean, and not as small as we'd feared. The clock didn't seem to work, and the T.V. kept cutting out, but it really didn't bother us. That night, the doors slammed constantly and it was quite noisy. Again, it was all tolerable. The cleaning staff noisily begins it's rounds sometime after 7 a.m. Doors slam, there are loud conversations in the hallways, and equipment seems to be banging around. We ignored it. We knew this was not the Plaza. However, the penny dropped the night before we left to go home. We came back after a Broadway play and asked if we could book a taxi for 4 a.m. the next morning. No, said the desk clerk, this is the concierge's job and he's gone for the night. Ok, can you book us a taxi. No. Can the person working the front desk at 4 a.m. book us or find us a taxi? No. I explained that I did not want to wander the streets of New York at 4 a.m. with my luggage looking for a taxi with my teenage son. The desk clerk responded that the neighbourhood was very safe, and I could find my own taxi easily. This really wasn't the point. Ok, fine. Can I check out? No, I could check out at 4 a.m. before I left. I can't check out now and just leave? No, I can check out when ""the day turns over"". I have no idea what this means - at midnight? No, maybe 3 a.m. What??????? It is the 21st century and apparently The Pod has not figured out a way to let guests check out automatically, the night before, or before a 4 a.m. departure time. Excellent. That night, there was a big party on our floor. Screaming, running and yelling down the halls, doors slamming, and general chaos. I called downstairs and while the call was acknowledged, nothing was done. All of this to say, for a family with very low hotel expectations, The Pod managed to undercut our lowest standards. Rude, poorly run, overpriced, and exhausting. Congratulations!","Twillingate, Canada",3,2.0

It's one part fun, one part style, three parts grin and bear it.My teen son and I stayed in two single rooms on a cheap Expedia package. The rooms are comically tiny but ingeniously designed, like little sleeping machines - or tourist-class ferry cabins.. Bed quality is awful, though, with cheap foam pads over rock-hard particle board and miserably thin prison pillows. Each room apparently has its own sink for washing and shaving, but shares two communal shower / toilet booths per floor. A red tally light above your door tells you when the booths are occupied by others. When the light goes out you run for it.Despite the withering one-star reviews here on TripAdvisor proclaiming this ""the worst hotel ever,"" etc., this perception holds only if you're a stranger to low-end European accommodation, where shared toilets are unremarkable and cleanliness is often a problem. The Pod is minimal, basic and clean. It was also mainly populated, on our stay, by European tourists untroubled by the Pod setup -- or by manners; the shouting and carousing went on all night. Between the punishing bed, the thin walls and the loud company, sleep was elusive. Service is nonexistent and we found the desk staff brusque and dismissive. They are perhaps just hardened against streams of Americans unloading on them because they can't believe there's no bathroom in their room. But they cop a snooty attitude befitting a high-style Schrager or Kimpton property, not a Formica-fitted vertical kennel for budget travelers.One big positive is the neighborhood -- you're in the thriving Turtle Bay area on the East Side, your block is lined with pubs and restaurants, and you're steps from Second Avenue with lots more.The Pod was one of those hotel stays I was interested to have but wouldn't volunteer to repeat.

I was going to stay at one of the Gansevoort properties, and when that didn't work out at the 55th moment, my sister reminded me the Pod could be an option, so I booked a room with double or queen bed and an included bathroom. I think this hotel is decent value if you're booking a room sans bathroom, but when you book a room with a bathroom, the price skyrockets. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay, though the $300 price tag was a little much for a simple bed and bath, even for NYC. The location is fantastic in Mid-Town East and the quiet street has a ton of different restaurants, including a Parisian wine bar.The RoomsThe room was well designed and very clean, aside from the carpet. Though it looked clean, if you shut the window and left, upon your return, the entire room would smell like dirty feet, a smell that emanated from the carpet. To counteract the scent, we just kept the window open. I was thankful I brought slippers with me! {Note that I forgot to tell the hotel about the carpet smell when I checked out, so Pod if you're reading this, I should have said something, but left in a big hurry!}The beds act like a couch by day {with the pillows stored in the closet} and a bed by night. The bathroom is mini like a cruise ship cabin's lavatory, but again, very smart design with nooks, hooks and crannies to store your toiletries. The white on stainless colour scheme was tasteful as well.I didn't really have much interaction with staff other than the concierge and bellmen, who were both helpful and pleasant. The Hotel The hotel itself is thoughtfully done. What I like about The Pod vs other pod or budget-style hotels is it didn't feel cheap. Additions like a little pay-for breakfast, snack and drinks area in the lobby and terrace was great, and the roof-top deck is of course a huge asset in NYC. All in all, I'd suggest it to others who want a fun and budget stay option in NYC, but as for myself, with so many other hotels in NYC, I might like to try others on subsequent trips!What to know- free wifi- some rooms have bathrooms, so don't {but have easily accessible shared facilitates}- great location with a grocery-type store down the street, subway access 2 blocks away, and great restaurants nearby- bring your own slippers- if you like to sleep with the window open, request additional blankets- note that anywhere in nyc, nightly taxes are huge. on our $300 nightly rate, we paid an additional $45/night.",Vancouver,226,4.0

The concierge service is also good, she checked us onto our flight online when we were leaving, printed our boarding pass&ordered us a taxi in about two mins.The only thing negative we found, and it is quite a big negative, we cane back from a day's sightseeing to find our room door lying wide open and the light was on. We had not left it like this. We immediately checked if anything was missing but thankfully there wasn't. I phoned to reception to complain& was told someone would be up immediately to check that the door hadn't been forced open and to ensure it was locking properly, no-one arrived so I went to reception & spoke to a different member of staff who could not have been less helpful. When I explained to him what had happened he did not even react, he simply stood looking at me blankly. I then asked him to send someone to check the door & he said he would.( no-one ever checked the door to our knowledge.) he didn't apologise, offer any form of assistance or explanation, extremely disinterested and unhelpful.

So, when the hotel left a letter in my room, asking me to go to the reception because the credit card I left for guarantee (and they have made a xerox of it, like they do - I think - with every guest's credit cards) wasn't working, I told them about my suspicion and... they haven't said anything!

I got an end room on the 14th floor that was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Since I have a bad back, I really liked the hard mattress. This is the first hotel that I didn't need to place the mattress on the floor. For those who complain about the staff or restaurants, there is no need to worry about trivia such as that unless you plan on making lifelong friends with everyone you encounter. Why worry about restaurants being in-house. There is a McDonald's a block down the street that sells angus snack wraps for $2. There is also an Emporium Supermarket 1/2 block down the street. If you are staying for one week, the MTA train passes are only $27 per week. You don't need to waste money on taxis. The trains go pretty close to any Manhattan destination. And if you are one of those poor chumps spending $50 to get to LaGuardia, save your money. With the MTA pass, or a $2 fare+transfer, you can take the #7 train, get off at Junction Blvd and take a 10-15 minute bus ride straight to LaGuardia. It only takes 30-45 minutes from The Pod to LaGuardia by MTA. As long as your suitcase has wheels, you might as well exercise them. The one thing missing at The Pod is an ice machine. So save your plastic bags from The Emporium. Then just walk a couple blocks down the street to the Double Tree Hotel, go up to a room area, and fill your plastic bag with free ice from their ice machines.

It's not that I find anything terribly wrong with the place, but I don't consider it to be in the top quarter of hotels in the city.Given that I was in town for business, I may be the wrong target audience, but I found that some of the touches that appeared to have been added to make the hotel seem trendier (such as very low levels of lighting in the hallways) actually backfired.

Loved the fact that each bunk had its own little TV. Apart from the VERY flat pillows, the beds were comfortable. (We requested extra pillows.) The shared bathroom facilities were ok and we never had to wait any length of time to use them. Only problem I found very annoying was the other guests who delighted in slamming doors at 2 or 3 am and the walls were pretty thin which meant one night we listened to the 2 guys in the next room talk till 2am. However, it was the night we were leaving at 4am to get an early flight so I figure we got our own back on them when we were leaving the room at 3.30am. Great places to eat nearby and most places we wanted to see were within walking distance. Staff seemed friendly enough but we didn't really have much interaction with them.

It's a little creepster at first, but you get used to it.- There really aren't many amenities to keep you inside, which probably won't be an issue in NY. (No room service, etc.)Now for the important and good stuff:- The room, while tiny, was absolutely adorable and cozy. - There's a nice-size TV for the room, just in case you need to chill for a couple of hours and let your feet recover.- There's a display over the door to show you which bathrooms are currently occupied so you don't have to leave your room to check during high-traffic times.- I stayed there during St. Pat's, and it's got a really lively nightlife. Safe but crowded, as long as you stay west of 3rd.- Insanely close to the police station and just half a block from a Duane Reed. You never know when you'll need one or the other.- It's only 2 avenue blocks from the 51st street subway stop. SUPER-CLOSE, and that stop will get you anywhere that you need to go on the east side, as well as get you to 53rd, where you can easily transfer over to go west.I would definitely recommend this hotel to solo travelers, because it's centrally located in a safe area, and it's very clean.

You enter the lobby and it feels like a destination (much more than other hotels in this price range)--it's decorated in a fun, eclectic way. Check-in was quick and efficient, and we were upgraded from a double to a queen, which was nice. They even have a concierge, which was pretty surprising in this price range.Our room was great. It is small, yes, but frankly we've stayed in smaller rooms in New York that were not advertised as ""pods,"" so really I found it roughly normal for this price range. And it was in much better condition than other hotels we'd stayed in. Everything was super clean, new, in good repair, etc. The room's design was sleek and functional. And it's the first room we stayed in in New York that didn't just have a view of a wall, as our room looked out on the street (though I am sure they have wall-facing rooms too, that is a New York special :) )I also loved the location. I may be biased as it's in our old neighborhood, but it's easy to walk to anywhere in Midtown, as well as the lower reaches of the Upper East Side. It's a residential neighborhood in East Midtown, so there are plenty of restaurants, casual bars, and shops serving the community. We also had a late-night dinner at the French bistro attached to the hotel (they serve food until 4am), which was delightful after a night out. It was tasty and authentic and the place was filled with French people.The only complaint we had was while we didn't hear a lot of street noise (though as former New Yorkers, we are probably less likely to feel bothered by it), the doors were thin and we heard a fair amount of noise from the hallway--not an issue when everyone was asleep late at night, but it definitely interrupted our afternoon nap. And of course, nothing in New York ever feels like that great a value, especially if you're used to traveling in Asia, but I did feel like this was the best hotel room I could have gotten for $200 in central Manhattan. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","New York, NY",124,5.0

We had an issue with a lock and our one light and this was fixed within an hour of us telling them about it. The only issue we had is that there is no business centre, even just a few desktops with internet would be great for travellers who do not travel with laptops. The bar attached to the hotel is great and the Thai restaurant 2 doors down is fantastic and they do a $12 lunch fixed meal which is divine.

I would definitely stay here again.Some reasons why I liked the Pod!: - Very friendly staff who would go out of their way to help us, the concierge in particular deserves a mention - Amazing view from rooftop, especially at night- will bring a bottle of wine next time! - Bright and funky designs in lobby and bedrooms, which make up for the tiny rooms - Bedrooms were immaculate and were tidied after ever time we went out - Rooms also have a safe to keep valuables - Great location right in Mid-town East (where all the tall buildings are!) - Good for meeting people especially if you're a solo travellerSome possible drawbacks are that you can hear everything that goes on in the hallway, and sometimes in the adjoining rooms, so maybe not ideal if you are a light sleeper. I brought earplugs though and had no problem sleeping. Rooms are very small but if you only really use your room to sleep in (which we did) then you won't find it a problem.

Upon checking in The Pod Hotel gives off this modern chic with Andy Warhol-ish comic pop art on the the walls and a few hip swivel chairs. I've been to several boutique hotels so I know that semi-swank lobbies are often the greatest disguise. Check in was OK nothing to write home about, for two nights our total was $309. Once we get to the room it was super tiny, again not too surprising it is NY after all. The bed was supposed to be full size but it seemed like a hybrid between a full and a twin. My brothers legs hung well off the end. There was little to no walking room especially if you just happened to bring a suitcase. To make matters worse, there was a blood stain on the pillow, we couldnt get the air off (which later turned to heat) and the toilet would not flush, which explained the weird smell in the room. We reported the toilet to the hotel and took the pillow down to the front desk, they seemed surprised about the pillow and said they would send someone up to fix the toilet and the air/heat issue. No such luck. We ended up having to use the restroom down the hall for both nights. Upon checkout, I spoke with the guy that checked us in and he acknowledged everything and said I wouldn't be able to talk to a manager because he was ""at lunch."" He said we would have to contact hotels.com and they would contact the hotel and then they would give permission to issue a refund. Days later the manager is still ""at lunch"" and has been unable to be reached by hotels.com. And if hotels.com (which is actually Expedia) is unable to get in touch with the manager you have to call back over and over again re-explaining what happened. As the end result, the hotel said they never said they would give me a refund and in turn hotels.com said they couldnt give me a refund if the hotel would approve it. I'm not surprised at the shadiness of this transaction given their response to the concerns. Within 24 hours of check out my brother was sick and has since been diagnosed with a bacterial infection, hmm I wonder where that turned up... We stayed in an awful hotel that was in violation of State of New York Health Code, inhaling sewage and sleeping in a bed that someone bled. I would steer clear of the nasty nasty Pod Hotel and potentially expedia/hotels.com, great job getting you into a hotel, but try contacting them to get you out and all you get is 45 minutes of elevator music.","East Lansing, Michigan",7,1.0

Walking into the lobby you feel like you are walking into a stylish boutique hotel. The rooms themselves, however, are literally pods ... they are tiny (at least the single bed room I stayed in). Tiny, as in there's a bed, a sink area, a desk and then a tiny bit of room next to the bed to walk to the window in. There are definitely walk-in closets bigger than my room at The Pod BUT everything in the room was modern, fun and high-end looking and more than sufficient for a place to rest after exploring NYC. I was in a room without its own bathroom but sharing the bathroom/shower was no problem at all. Lights in my room indicated which of 4 bathrooms were available and I did not find myself needing to wait my turn. The bathrooms themselves were clean and again modern and high-end looking. And on top of it The Pod offers free wi-fi throughout the hotel, something that comes in handy if you're trying to book a broadway show (within walking distance ... 10-15min walk) or figure out how to navigate the subway system (subway station is just half a block away). The neighborhood is upscale and safe with lots of restaurant, bars and delis nearby. The only slight negative was the hotel walls are a little thin ... I had a room right next to the bathroom and woke up a few times at night as people slammed doors shut. Overall, in terms of budget conscious traveling whilst still living in style, I don't think it gets much better than this for a hotel in Manhattan. If you're looking to do cartwheels in your hotel room, travel with multiple pieces of ginormous luggage or are one to spend hours hanging out in your hotel room then the Pod might not be for you. But if you're looking for a budget conscious, fun and modern place to stay whilst exploring Manhattan, The Pod is an excellent choice.

I've stayed at The Larchmont before three years ago and there's no comparison between the two. The Pod wins hands down.There are almost no normal hotel facilities. No gym, no bar, no restaurant, no room service. I asked at the front desk if I could buy water and was directed to the local store down the road. There was a vending machine containing cans of Coke. But that's why the room rate is so low.The lobby looks like a smart hotel lobby and does have luggage porters and a concierge to help with your trip. They printed out a store voucher from the shop's web site for me happily.I got a single room that had a single bed, desk, iPod dock, stainless steel sink, safe and storage space. For one person it was enough room. The shutters on the windows did a good job keeping out the daylight when closed and helped make the room feel clean. I saw a double room through an open door and it also looked enough. Spacewise, it reminded me of budget hotels in Paris I've stayed in. Americans used to Days Inn motel rooms in Florida would be shocked however. The iPod dock (an iHome model) would not charge my iPhone 4 (the iPhone displayed an error message) which was irritating both to me and I'm sure the hotel management whose fashionable attempt at future-proofing has been thwarted by Apple's relentless upgrades. The wifi was a bit hit and miss though. The signal was strong enough but the throughput was at times too slow to be usable during the day and evening. It's free though and every Starbucks also has super fast free wifi so wasn't a disaster. The shared bathrooms were great. Clean, nicely designed and I was happy to discover they used exactly the same gel dispensers that I bought and installed at home. Big, strong showers and there are lights in your room telling you if the bathrooms are in use. Even at peak times, there was always at least one free. So I would definitely come back here.

The room itself was quite small, but had a sink and mirror and each bed had a small tv with headphone connections.

I do think that paying an average of $200 per night per room withoth bathroom was expensive,but considering the time I travel and the location of this hotel, I am actually very happy. For instance, it was nice that no matter which part of Manhattan we were, it was actually quite cheap the ride in cab from there to the hotel. The hotel is blocks aways from 5th avenue, Rockefeller Center and Times Square, which was something we appreciated, specially when we returned from the Times Square on the 31th Dec.We stayed in a bunk bed room. It was bigger actually that what I thought, considering that some people have said you feel claustrophobic, I didnt feel at all like that (although we were most of the time out). I liked the fact that always we have clean towels, paper, a TV (good to know about the weather in winter!!) and the room had a washbasin. Also we put our passports and other important documents in the safety box that was placed in the room.The shared bathrooms were always clean, they had shampoo and soap which I thought it was a plus. We never had any trouble regading the availability of the bathrooms, and as other have said it was good that in each room you have a sign letting you know which bathroom are available.The only thing that I didnt like was the speed of the internet. It was super slow, and sometimes it was just impossible to connect.

Shared bathrooms? why? its an Adventure that's why!We arrived WAY too early to check into the hotel. We found the staff was very friendly and well versed in what is around the general area of the hotel. Which is United Nations. there are plenty of yummy bistros and bars for any price range and appetite. They held our bags and we went off exploring. When we were finally allowed to check into our room it was a teeny tiny room with cool bunk beds, a desk, and sink area. There are little lights above the door that showed us there were 4 bathrooms on our floor and when lighted so you knew which ones were occupied. What the little lights did not tell you was that 1 size did not fit all. Bathroom 2 on the 4th floor is SUPER TINY. While bathrooms 3&4 are spacious. (Bathroom 3 has body jets in the shower and a bench) All I am saying is as a shared bathroom experience goes this was pretty good! Very clean. My only complaint about the shared bathroom is that there were no stock hand towels kept in there. Even a roll of paper towels would be great. For those of us who make those late night trips to the bathroom, a towel is not usually on your list of what you need to remember at 4am! Room key yes, towel..not so much. Otherwise this was a good experience. Being our first time staying any length of time in the big apple that wasn't work related, we weren't in the room long enough for the size of it to bother us.

What an amazing place, seriously! Check-in was completely smooth, as was check-out on the day we left, as well as the service - the hotel booked us onto an airport shuttle bus and held our luggage for us until it was time to leave.The room itself was, yes, quite small, but it was more than adequate for two girls with big suitcases and a lot of clothes. The personal TV screens and the iPod dock were great touches, as well as the free Wi-Fi. The beds were comfortable - I usually have problems sleeping in a bed that isn't my own, but not here!We took the shared bathroom option and there were zero problems with this. There were four bathrooms on our floor, and at all times were clean. They're all different as well, so as sad as this may sound, it became a bit of a surprise visiting each one! The rain head showers are incredible - and try and source out one of the bathrooms that has additional back-height jets.The location as well is fantastic - it's only a few blocks walk along 51st to reach the Rockerfeller area, and from there Times Square is close. The subway is very close, and a few blocks down is a stop for the sightseeing buses. Closer to home, just around the corner from the hotel is a selection of good bars and a café that we ended up having our breakfast in each day - so good!All in all, the hotel was one of the highlights of our trip, which, in a city like New York, tells you just how good it must have been! Obviously we could have stayed somewhere a lot more expensive to get more amenities, but honestly, why bother when you can save so much money and stay in such a great place as this?","Weston Underwood, United Kingdom",3,5.0

I traveled to NYC over Thanksgiving weekend and paid $160 a night for a single room with a bathroom. I'm a middle-aged guy and found the double-bed thoroughly comfortable and the clientele (mostly young Europeans) fun to be around. The hotel is a 15- to 20-minute walk to Times Square, and there are many dining option, expensive and in-, nearby. The hotel bar is comfortable and friendly. The hotel staff is efficient and friendly enough.A quibble: the room's temperature control was not up to snuff. The old, pre-renovation heating pipes made the room uncomfortable enough that I had to run the AC and/or open the window. And I didn't see the double-occupancy rooms, so I don't know how comfortable the accommodations would be for a duo.Having said that, this is a hotel to which I'd certainly return and which I'd recommend to those on a shoestring budget.","Portland, Oregon",35,4.0

I had actually booked two nights at a very good rate, but decided I wanted to stay an extra night. The desk staff very kindly allowed me to stay on the extra night at that same low rate, even though it was Thanksgiving Day, when all the hotels in Manhattan seemed to double in price. If they hadn't, I would have had to check out, so I really appreciated this.I had a double pod room, which includes a bathroom. The room is small, but it's not a small room masquerading as a normal hotel room. The layout and fit-out are designed with the size in mind, so the room manages to squeeze in a double bed (which doubles as a couch during the day), desk and chair, bedside table, clothes storage (hanging and drawers) and a sink and mirror. Even with all this, the room does not seem cramped. The bathroom was fine - small, but I've seen bathrooms that are far more cramped and uncomfortable than this one in much more expensive hotels. I am a tall person, but I didn't have any issues with the size of the room or the bathroom. And everything was reasonably clean, and not at all rundown or dated. I was relieved to find the free wi-fi worked perfectly - I so hate having to mess around with paid systems at hotels that never work well and cost a bomb.The reception staff were always accommodating and helpful. One night I ordered takeaway food and the restaurant forgot to give me cutlery to eat with. I asked the desk staff if they could help, and the kind lady ended up giving me some (wrapped) disposable cutlery from her own handbag.My only complaint was that the door was not well-insulated against noise. Because of the shared bathrooms on the floor, there is a lot of coming and going (and door slamming) in the hallway, which could be quite loud in my room. Otherwise the hotel was very quiet - I was surprised at how quiet it was given its central location.","Brisbane, Australia",22,4.0

So if you looking for a budget option (relative to other NYC hotels) the Pod is for you.As I was travelling Solo I booked the Single Pod with shared bathroom. I was a bit worried about sharing bathrooms before the booking but took comfort in other reviewers who said that sharing a bathroom wasn't a problem.The room was small but I expected that from the hotel's site. However once you are actually faced with how small it is, it takes a bit of a mind shift to get used to the limited space. Decor was utilitarian and functional. The room consisted of a bed which was pretty big for a single bed (I'm 6'1"" and there was a few inches to spare) and comfortable. There was a small basin with just enough space to store my toiletries, plenty of towels and the room was spotless.Negatives (not deal breakers but simple things that could make one's stay just that bit better):The head of my bed was right against the aircon and under the window. The aircon was noisy (especially considering that my head was right by the vent). Even though it was winter there was definitely a need to get ventilation into the room either by opening the window or using the aircon. So I had a choice to open the window and deal with the street noise or use the aircon and deal with its noise. I opted for the latter. Although the aircon was right by my head and making a noise it became a white noise and I was able to sleep. But I have a dad who I used to hear snore through the walls of our house when I was a kid, so lighter sleepers beware!! I could have moved my bed around and slept at the other end but I couldn't be asked to remake a bed that was tucked in and wasn't bothered by the aircon too much to ask reception to sort it out. For lighter sleepers you might want to ask for a room as far away from the elevators as possible as they bing everytime they arrive. I didn't notice it from my room (which was the furthest away possible) but I suspect the rooms closer to the elevators would probably be disturbed by the bings. The doors of the room aren't the thickest ...For those who think that retro is ""so now"" or like to be nosalgic the 14.4kbs dial up speed of the free wireless internet is ridiculous! I didn't go to NYC to sit and surf the Internet all day so I wasn't expecting South Korea 1000mbs speeds but when Gmail fails to load at times due to the slow connection it gets a bit annoying. One wants to be able to surf the essential sites such as Airway's self check-in, Gmail, Tripadvisor and MTA without having to hit reload several times before it works.Bathrooms were very clean. They seem to be cleaned several times a day. There were two bathrooms on the floor I was on (11th) and most of the time they were available. At peak times 8am to 9am both were occupied but there was never more than a 5 min wait. Be aware that not all bathrooms are made equal. Bathroom number two was bigger and had a bigger basin than bathroom number one but both were adequate. Plenty of hot water and a lovely rain head shower. One thing that would be great is if the hotel could supply robes. This would be useful when you want to nip to the loo in the middle of the night and don't feel like getting dressed (after a few beers the in-room sink looked very, very tempting but for all you who are thinking, ""Oh my gosh he didn't did he??"", I didn't...) and also after a shower it would be great not having to get dressed in the bathrooms (although I walked through the corridors with a towel around my waist putting anyone who walked passed me off their breakfast).Roof deck is worth going up and having a look at all the skyscrapers and huge apartment blocks. One soon realises that New Yorkers live in tiny places too and the cramped conditions aren't only reserved to one's hotel room! Great for nightime photography with a tripod and in summer I would expect it would be a great place to hang out. There is a sign saying hours of operation are between 9am and 9pm but I went up there at 11pm and it was still open. Even though there was a security cam no one came to tell me to leave so I suspect they may not enforce those hours?All in all I was happy with my stay at the Pod. Reception staff did their job but weren't overly attentive (not that I had much to do with them). Rooms are clean and deliver what they promise (don't compare prices with other cities - even London - you're just going to upset yourself) and the location is great for Midtown shopping and sightseeing.If I were to go back to NYC I'd definitely stay there again.","Cape Town Central, South Africa",16,4.0

There’s way too much to see outside of the hotel room anyway (this is NYC after all), the only thing I really saw in the room was the inside of my eyelids while I was sleeping. The hotel is in a good location, close enough to the subway. Being in this city you should accept that you are going to walk a whole lot. There were nice eateries close by and late night convenience stores. Ess-a-Bagel on 831 3rd Avenue (51st/52nd Sts) is a must and is only a 2 minute stroll from The Pod.The nightly rate was $197USD, not too bad for an expensive city.

Space is used extremely efficiently, with under-bed drawers to provide additional storage. The shower/bath area is very compact, but it uses glass doors creatively to reduce the feeling of claustrophobia. The room decor and furniture could have come right out of an IKEA catalog, which is OK. Screws attaching the decorative wooded panel covering the AC unit were broken, and the panel hung off the unit at a precarious angle. The room was clean when we arrived, and the maids kept it that way throughout our 4 day stay. However, the hallways of the hotel had a definite ""locker-room"" smell, kind of like old sneakers.My only complaint about the room is the placement and installation of the TV. Because it was a flat-screen, bolted to the wall, you had to stand in front of it to see the screen. Trying to view the screen from anywhere else in the room was impossible, because of the narrow viewing angle of this particular TV set. A simple swivel bracket would have made the TV watchable from the bed.Our biggest disappointment was the staff. When we checked in, the clerk sent us immediately up to the room, where we learned that the maid was still cleaning it. Since there's no place to sit on floors above the lobby, we had to take our bags back downstairs and wait in the lobby. In a modern hotel, the desk should know which rooms are ready for occupation. Experiences with the concierge and bell captain were equally underwhelming. Although not rude or incompetent, they simply gave the impression that weren't particularly interested in guests' needs.The location was convenient, with several neighbor bars and restaurants within short walking distance, and the hotel is located on a fairly quiet street, so sleeping was not a problem.","Eugene, Oregon",41,3.0

One thing that I noticed is that all communal bathrooms are not alike. The first two times I must of lucked out because the bathrooms where huge on those floors, not the case this time. Very tiny, not good for women trying to get ready. So ask ahead for the floor with bigger bathrooms. Rooms were clean and small, to be expected. Close to where I wanted to go and the subway. Bad mistake of calling the restaurant in the hotel for pick-up. I wanted something quick and easy, I went online and looked at their menus then called. They said they didn't go by that menu anymore, so after 3 calls back and forth finally had garden salad, frites and the macaroni which was still close to $30. Would not recommend the restaurant.

The bathroom itself has a sliding door(obviously to save space) but when you pull this into place to give yourself some privacy it reveals a window to the bathroom! very Bizarre, just make sure who ever you share the room with you are VERY comfortable with!There was a small amount of storage space, 2 drawers under the bed and an open closet to hang your clothes in and 2 bedside tables with ""cubby"" holes. We lived mainly out of our suitcase so didnt really matter to us, too much effort to unpack.There was about a 12inches between the bed and the window and about 30 inches the otherside between the bed and the bathroom space.At the foot of the bed was a desk and chair. We didnt use this as this was used for storage of a suitcase for us.The bed itself was clean and remade everyday.

I stayed 4 nights from Saturday-Wednesday.I arrived at 7am but the hotel was full and I was unable to get a room before lunchtime (which was dissapointing as I had made a point of requesting an early check-in if possible on my booking since I had been awake for 28 hours!) They did however happily check my bags for me, and the lady at the front desk was very friendly and provided me with towels, soap and shampoo to take a shower.The rate I paid was a lot more than I would usually pay for a single room without a bathroom ($159 per night) but it was over the Columbus Day long weekend and I only booked about 5 weeks in advance so I was happy to pay it.I had a quiet room on the 7th floor. I'd recommend requesting a room at the end of the hall/away from the bathrooms lifts if you are a light sleeper. I had a room at the end of the hall and I think it may have been a little bigger (I'm talking like a foot!) than some of the other singles. I didn't have any problems in my room except for a noisy neighbour who insisted on speaking loudly in another language with his phone on speaker phone - thankfully this only happened until about 8pm, so I didn't bother asking anyone in the hotel to speak with him. Also on my last night my neighbours cellphone/alarm went off at 2:30am and I could hear it through the wall.Housekeeping were friendly and left me extra towels without asking and fulfilled all requests that I left for them (a large trash bag to put my dirty laundry in one day, and new batteries for my TV remote another day) - maybe because I left a $2 tip every day?Room only had one pillow but the front desk promptly brought me up another one when requested. Room had 2 towels, a bathmat, hand towel and face washer. Sink in room was great, and I loved the big TV above the bed! Bed was comfy and no signs of bed bugs (I did a thorough inspection before even unpacking my luggage into my room.My only gripe was that my room didn't have the advertised bathroom signal lights, so I had to go down the hall to see if a bathroom was free, however as many other reviewers have said, I never had a problem with finding a free bathroom on my floor, morning or night. The showers on the 7th floor (or the 14th floor where I showered on my first morning here) didn't have the side-jets that some other reviewers have talked of, but I couldn't be bothered going in search of them. Bathrooms were always clean when I used them, although some more were spacious than others so it was just a case of checking out the ones on your floor and finding your favourite! They seemed to be cleaned multiple times a day which is good!Location was good - especially if you like a location that isn't as noisy as somewhere like Times Square. There was a good Deli on the corner of 51st and 3rd called Azure which had good danishes for breakfast and I frequented that on a daily basis. About a 15 minute walk to Broadway and Central Park. Subway stations at 51st/Lexington and 53rd/Lexington are only a 5 minute walk away and can get you pretty much everwhere you want to go. Otherwise a cab was about $6-7 from Broadway or Central Park South.Staff were friendly enough - no gripes there, although nobody went out of their way, and once when I asked the concierge to find out if there was a laundry service nearby (and told him I'd be back in 30 minutes) when I got back he had forgotten.WiFi worked in my room, although not the fastest out there, but better than nothing!Overall a very good experience. I'd definately recommend this to single travellers and possibly 2 friends travelling together (get a bunk room) if you are happy to live in close quarters.

Bed was comfortable, and got good quiet sleep. The place isn't as trendy as it wants you to think. WiFi signal was strong, but the speed was horribly slow. Having lived in Manhattan for a decade, walking into the lobby, I felt like I was no longer in NYC. It's antiseptic and trendy in a way that would feel cutting-edge in Albany or Scranton, but here in the big city, the Pod Hotel would only seem cool to people who don't know NYC. Folks from Chattanooga probably think they've entered the 22nd Century.Once I'm choosing this sort of accomodation, I'd prefer a smaller room and a cheaper price. I had planned a one-day business trip to NYC that became a two-day trip, and so I needed a room quickly preferably in mid-town. Checked for availability online, and then booked over the phone. Checkin was quick and painless. My complaint is that I paid $150, and for that money I can get a kingsize bed in Long Island City, 3 subway stops away.The WiFi is amazingly slow, and suitable for Email and that's about it. It was about 80 kbps. For comparison, for Skype you want 150 kbps or more, Skype with video or YouTube you want 250 kbps, and my ADSL at home is about 350 kbps. I experienced the slowness in the evening around 7:00 PM when you might expect a lot of people to be connected, but it was no better at 4:00 AM so I have to conclude they really aren't trying to make the WiFi any good.Travelling from Europe, and staying on London time, I do go to sleep at 7:00 PM and wake up at 2:30 AM, so I wasn't in bed late enough to report whether there were bed bugs or not, although I've seen no reports. (I understand they like to bite closer to 4:00 AM by which time my bed was empty).Generally don't mind the cheap micro-room hotels especially if I'm just going to sleep 6 hours and leave. Don't even mind the toilet/shower down the hall. The Pod has one bonus: running water in the room for brushing teeth, drinking water, shaving, etc. which means the toilet/showers have more availability. The Pod is okay, but the best thing I can say about it, is that they had a room available for under $200 when no place else in NYC did. With even a few hours more advance notice, I probably would have stayed at a Comfort Inn.",American In Europe,59,3.0

I chose this hotel because of its affordability and seems to be close to everything when I checked out its website. I was skeptical about the size of room and the shared bathroom situation. I'm just used to staying at hotels with a lot of square footage at a cheaper price like Las Vegas. But of course you cant compare that to NYC. I booked the bunk bed room because it was the cheapest and there was a big difference in price if I were to book the queen. Upon arrival I was surprised. The room was small but functional. I asked for a quiet room and that's what I got. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. TV worked just fined for me. For those that are skeptical about sharing bathrooms, dont be. There are 4 bathrooms on each floor and each is located in different section of the floor. So I shared the bathroom with only about 5 other guests that were staying next to me, and keep in mind that 1 or 2 of the guests staying close to you have their own bathroom. Bathroom is frequently cleaned, everytime I go in to use it was fine. It also helps to have nice neighbors who keeps it clean as well. So if you like living in the dorms when you were in college, you'll like this. The crowd is pretty much international, a lot of Europeans. My floor was very quiet, however even though my room is tucked away in the corner and away from the elevators I can still hear people coming in and out but it didnt bother me at all since it was brief. The location and neighborhood is unmatched. I highly recommend this hotel especially for first timers. ATMs, Banks, Drug Stores, Restaurants and Subways are all very close within 1-2 blocks. It gives you a piece of mind that even though you're away from home but everything you need is accessible. 5th ave, Park ave, Rockefeller Center, Times Square are within walking distance and Central Park and Ground Zero memorial site are short subway rides away. I was a little afraid to take the subway but once you spend time learning the system it'll make your experience much more rewarding. You can go to mta.com to find out about fares, routes and schedules. You can even type in your location and destination on the website and it will show you which train to take, you can't go wrong. It will help you navigate the city. I love my NYC experience and can't wait to return. What I like the most about this trip is not just about NYC itself, but also the hotel that is affordable, comfortable and convenient. WiFi is available even though I feel it was a little too slow that'd like but will not complain since it was free. Staffs could have friendlier and more attentive. I didn't need my butt kissed but I was their guest, it'd be nice if they had anticipated my needs more and lose the attitude that they were doing me a favor by doing their job. This goes to the front desk. The conceirge was available when I checked in at night but nonexistent in the morning when I needed help. New Yorkers I met were very friendly in offering me assistance with directions. I've met them in the subway, Central Park, on the street and they were willing to help even when they were on the phone or jogging, so maybe I should have paid them? But I'd definitely return to The Pod.","Los Angeles, California",16,4.0

I was traveling with my sister and had booked a double room with private bath. The staff automatically upgraded us to a double double with private bath without my even asking. This was more than enough room for the two of us. Furnishings are utilitarian to maximize space and bathroom is small, but, if you like, contemporary, which I do, and you are prepared for that by reading the reviews here, which I was, I don't think you'll be disappointed. My main complaints are that the room was very stuffy and stale and the air conditioner never worked completely adequately. It was not terrible enough to ask for a room switch but we would have enjoyed our stay more had it been better. The internet was easy to access but it was just a touch slow for the work that I wanted to do. The cost of this hotel, which I do think is comparable to the cost of staying in other places in Manhattan, makes it hard to want to tolerate such imperfections.

In an extreme makeover a few years ago, sleek and minimalist polished wood decor replaced the homely furnishings of old and prices rose accordingly.

The new name, however, is a possible misnomer since it may evoke to some the pod-like capsule hotels of Japan, to which it bears no real resemblance. Actually, the name seems to have derived from the I-pod attachable music players which were featured in the rooms after the renovations, the name attempting perhaps to suggest the trendiness these no longer trendy devices once possessed. The best thing about this hotel is not the hotel itself, which admittedly has its weak points, but its location, which is on a comparatively quiet street between two busy avenues. There's a lovely pocket sized park with a water feature practically opposite the hotel, and the stretch of 2nd Avenue around the corner offers everything the short- or longer-term traveler needs including a supermarket, large drugstore, Starbucks, old style New York coffee shops, and a variety of ethnic restaurants. Mid-town tourist and business locations are easily accessible, and Grand Central and Penn Station are short cab rides away. If you are looking to save a pile of cash relative to more typical Manhattan hotels, are not expecting personalized caring service, and are willing to put up with the minimal inconvenience of shared facilities and diminutive albeit clean and mainly bright rooms, then the Pod Hotel is hard to beat. (Note: As indicated, this review is based on a number of visits the most recent one being prior to the date shown, which was the earliest date offered as a selection option.)","London, United Kingdom",4,4.0

This was never the case. More than half an hour of stuffing around continued as they looked for the original booking even though we showed proof that we had confirmed our booking. We were finally given a room and were kindly (deservedly) upgraded from a bunk room to a queen room which was much appreciated. The room was great - clean, cosy, storage friendly, with a bathroom and toilet. The bed was extremely comfy. The located was fantastic, right in Midtown, one night we even walked back from Times Square here. There is a subway 5 minutes away and there is some great little restaurants nearby. This is a great hotel to base yourself from in New York. The value for money is excellent. I wanted to call home one night (Australia) and the front desk recommended purchasing an international phone card so I didn't have to pay the expensive hotel rates, I did this but then we checked out, I found out that this did not cover my calls just lower the rates, consequently $300 was added to our bill at check out - to say we were not happy with this would be a severe understatement as you can imagine. If check in and check out had never occured, I would recommend this hotel 100%.

We didn't need a big screen tv in our room because we didn't spend much time there. It was relatively quiet because it is on a smaller street. When I was looking for a hotel, I finally decided on this one because a number of people had recommended it to me. It's in a convenient safe area and the price is cheaper than other hotels around it. The staff were great and checked us in early and coordinated our trip back to the airport. If you're looking for something classy or luxurious, definitely go somewhere else.

We had booked it on several recommendations, and booked a double room with private en suite.However, after seeing some photos on trip advisor, we decided to upgrade to a Queen room... the standard doubles are smaller and have a large single bed pushed up against the wall. Fine if you are a couple, but not for two girlfriends!Also, take note that room tax of nearly 20% is added to the bill - this is in the small print of your email confirmation, but when we added it to our total, I started to wonder if we could have found a queen room in a better hotel. A quick Expedia search proved we could have done... even the Hilton's, Radisson's and Marriott's could have offered us a larger queen room for the same price or less, so do your research. The Pod is okay value for NYC, but you can get good deals on other places too.ANYWAY... we kept our booking with the Pod and I'm glad we did. The hotel is very centrally located. Very close to Chrysler building, Rockefeller, St Patrick's Cathedral, and 5th Avenue. The bed was comfy, bathroom bigger and more private than anticipated, and plenty of clever storage space for two girls with a lot of luggage! The rooms are spotless, cleaned thoroughly and made up daily with fresh towels etc. The hotel itself is clean, with a good lobby area and concierge service. It sells itself on being a basic base, but I was impressed with the facilities on offer.There is a fab roof terrace with stunning views. You're free to take your own food and drink up here too which is perfect for a pre dinner glass of wine! On the down side, the hotel is on a fairly noisy part of the street, and the A/C was also noisy (although much needed!). The local area has some fab restaurants and bars. Try Mimis on 2nd, and the French bistro next door to the Pod - both were excellent.Overall, as a base the Pod is perfect. We used our room to shower and sleep, and for that it is ideal.

Lucky for me, The POD Hotel was all that and more. When you first walk into the lobby, it is eclectic, modern and trendy. The staff is very helpful and friendly, and the guests, mostly young international travelers, were very friendly as well. However, I would not recommend this place for a family. It is for young travelers, almost like a hostel but nicer. We got a decent deal, considering the location and prices of comparable hotels. The room was tiny but adequate, bare-bones amenities, but clean and well kept. We were out sightseeing most of the time and were barely in our room. My brother and I booked a bunk-bed style room, and it was perfect for us. I was skeptical about a “community bathroom,” but they were actually very nice and private. There were four individual bathrooms on each floor, each marble lined with nice showerheads and side jets. Tip: Bring shower shoes or flip flops to wear in the community bath! Forgot this little detail. Also, check out the rooftop deck on the top floor. It is a great place to see the lights at night and enjoy a six-pack. ☺ The neighborhood is fantastic! Good restaurants, (check out the rooftop patio at the Stag’s Head pub a few doors over…FABULOUS microbrew selection!) close to the Subway and Rockefeller Center. I felt very safe here, too. The streets were well lit and always had a lot of people around. When you book the room, they also set you up on a forum called PodCulture where you can meet fellow travelers who are staying there as well.

There is also a small desk with an alarm-clock/iDocking station. So much for the good part.Now the bad part. The rooms are very small, and although the toilets and bathrooms that have to be shared with neighbouring rooms are clean, I found the room itself not very clean. There were strange stains on the bedsheets!! The pillows were also not comfortable, so unfortunately we were not really able to get a good night's sleep. The rooms are also very small. Did not disturb me as I was shopping and visiting sites all day long, but if you are claustrophobic, don't expect anything spacious.Most of the people in this hotel are a young bunch. Perhaps students or backpackers who just need a place to sleep without all the luxuries? There are enough places where you can get something to eat in the area, so this made up for the lack of restaurants in the hotel itself. The rooftop of the hotel is very nice and offers cool views in one of the ""quieter"" areas of manhattan.Having said all of the above, I find the value was OK as the rooms did not cost much.

We didn't want to spend money on a fancy place to be unconscious because we knew we'd spend most of our week out exploring. But the time spent at the Pod was always great. From stepping into the colourful lobby where we were checked in quickly and efficiently to checking out the tiny room. I've read some negative stuff about the staff but I feel like I need to come to their defense. Just as an example, one night we brought a bottle of wine back to the hotel and realized we didn't have a corkscrew - the front desk clerk went running around trying to find one for us and delivered! I wish I had his name...I could go on about the room itself the but all the pictures and other reviews would make that redundant. Needless to say we enjoyed all the amenities.The location worked out for us and we managed to walk to most places. Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, the list goes on. As for places to eat you basically walk to 2nd Ave, close your eyes, and point and you'll be headed in the direction of some place wonderful. We tired not to repeat places but found ourselves at the Morningstar Cafe twice.If you're claustrophobic or a germaphobe this place may not be for you with its tight quarters and shared facilities. But I like the economy of it all and it definitely made my trip a lot easier and cheaper.","Vancouver, Canada",0,4.0

It was my first time in the States and I arrived straight from the airport. The check-in staff were inches away from being outright rude and I had a wrangle with the receptionist about a hefty deposit I had to put down that I had not been told about previously. As I had already paid for the room I was not impressed and very dubious. I didn't have anywhere else to go and decided to trust her - I did get my money back but they could definitely have handled it better!My room was small but exactly what I was expecting. The safe was easy to use and the recommended phone card shop across the street was fine. I was able to use the room phone and the TV was nice.The bed was okay but the noise inside the building - especially considering I had jet lag and so should have been out like a light - was atrocious. I woke up on and off all night and eventually decided to get up at 6am as the noise hadn't stopped. Luckily I had gone to bed at 8pm and was fairly excited anyway so I felt okay.The bathrooms were amazing - large, clean and with plenty of hot water. I have stayed in several youth hostels and was expecting a similar set-up but these far outshone them, The light system in the rooms that lets you know which bathrooms are free is also useful.The morning receptionist recommended a great diner for breakfast and the overall hotel location was good if you don't mind walking (and I didn't). It was within a forty minute walk from everything I wanted to see. I had been inundated with scare stories about NY safety before I left the UK but the hotel room felt safe and the people staying there seemed okay.Given the price of New York hotels I would probably stay here again as it's good value for money as long as you bring some earplugs!","Durham, United Kingdom",25,3.0

Our room was a Queen pod, which was the size of a small master bedroom, but we found it perfect for our needs: we were out and about all day, so we really needed a room for a cool and restful sleep after a long day of pounding the pavement. The bed was comfortable, the air-conditioning worked very well (although the cleaning staff occasionally turned it off...) which was fortunate because we had very hot temps during our stay. The room was also quiet - we never heard sounds or noise from other rooms. The cafe was a great place for breakfast and the coffee was very good (a big plus for two hardcore coffee drinkers like us!). We enjoyed going up to the rooftop at the end of the day- although technically it is ""closed"" at 9 p.m. we would often head up there well after midnight for a look at the fabulous skyline. (The rooftop is pretty bare bones - there's some wooden platforms for seating, but not much else.) The Pod is in a great area of town- 2 blocks from the subway, and about a $7 cab ride to the Theatre district/Times Square. There are also a number of reasonably priced restaurants on the same block (we enjoyed Thai 51 and the food and service at Tanaka Sushi was fabulous) Just around the corner on 3rd Avenue there was a grocery store (as well several good late-night conner stores close by too). The only thing we really missed in the room was a mini-fridge - it would've been nice to have a place to chill some drinks (we ended up buying bags of ice and wrapping them in towels in the shower). Overall, we got what we expected at the Pod - small, clean, simple, safe, and very reasonably priced.","Winnipeg, Canada",26,4.0

It is by no means a luxury stay (the room we got, with bathroom, was almost the only upgrade you can get), but we enjoyed it. It was almost like being in a train sleeper car, without the rumbling and squeaking. Nice little semi-public garden across the street, where we relaxed and ate once. Several restaurants on the block, and a supermarket on the corner. It was nice to be in more of a neighborhood that the last time we visited, when we were closer to Times Square.

The staff were almost always extremely helpful. The woman that checked us in acted like she was doing us a favour but later struck up a conversation with me when I told her we had flown in from Melbourne. Odd. Besides that everyone was very attentive. The rooms are tiny (we booked their most spacious room-the queen room) and the bathroom in the room is minuscule. However, it was very clean and modern and they give you lovely toiletries. I also saw shared marble bathroom and it was clean and very spacious! NYC has some seriously horrible hotels in the budget price range. This is not one of them. The Pod is like an adult hostel for those with taste in a handy location. It's excellent for what it is and very clean.

My luggage was left in LAX and the staff were also very helpful in notifying me of when it arrived nearly two days later. My room met my criteria. I wanted a room that was secure, that my belongings were secure and clean. My bed was made every day and the shared bathroom system worked a treat.

She said, as if I was to blame, that the townhouse was closed so they had books four rooms for us instead. I said: ""Fine, as long as we pay the same."" She looked at me and made a really childish face and said: ""You are soo cute"" - meaning that my comment was stupid..

Wireless readily available and contrary to some reviews on here was not slow at all.Staff, especially the concierge and front desk really friendly and helpful. Really good location as only 2 blocks from the 6 train and 3 from more lines, walking distance to Time Sq / Broadway or Bloomingdales areas. Also plenty of eateries close by - check out PJ Clarkes or rare for a burger. Not far to head to Central Park too for a morning run which was a lovely way to start the day.Only slight down side is perhaps proximity to fire station and noise travels a little dow the corridors but after the first night I hardly noticed so no dramas.Have really enjoyed staying here and would come back for sure.

We each had a single 'pod' or room and shared a bathroom with a number of other guests. The bathrooms were really well done, with nice tile and powerful showere AND they were always clean (I think they cleaned them a few times a day) and you had a light system in your pod that told you which bathrooms were available and where they all were. On the whole I didn't mind this system, but if you want to get out the door early and take a shower - make sure you are up and awake. The one beneficial thing from the pod was that I did have my own sink. The design of the room was modern, but the bed was a little on the hard side for me. There was enough storage under the bed and on a rail and overall I found that while the room was maybe on the somewhat 'frugal' side, it was actually rather cosy and I fit the things in the pod around my needs. I would argue the only problem in the summer time is that the air conditioning was a little lacking. There wasn't so much of a view from my pod (like most NY hotels), but there was a really nice roof terrace from which you could see a lot of the surrounding area. The great thing about the Pod was that it was so close to lots of restaurants - we ate breakfast from a cozy little dinner on 2nd just around the corner. And there is also a car rental no more than 5 minutes down the road. Additionally there is also a FedexKinkos around the corner which gave us good internet access for a small cost - as while the hotel has wifi, it was really slow and a bad connection. Overall I really liked the Pod, I thought it was a good modern concept, a great location for my needs and the staff were friendly, but it was a bit costly for what it actually was - a small, frugal room.","London, United Kingdom",13,4.0

My partner, teenage stepdaughter and myself were on our way back from Costa Rica to the UK but got stranded at NY Newark airport. There wasn’t much accomodation left by the time we got through to the hotel booking desk at the airport and we ended up booking the POD Hotel, 230 East 51st Street in NY Manhatten.The Hotel has no bar or restaurant, its like an appartment block with a reception area where the rooms are rented out. Apparently this is a cheap and trendy location for young people which want to visit NYC. At USD 320 excl. tax a night, I did not find the Hotel cheap but maybe it was, I havent got a clue what similar hotels in the area charge and it probably did not help that we had no choice due to the airspace closure, the hotel probably knew this as well.The rooms are tiny and the miniature shower and toilet share a frosted glass door which means when you use the shower, the toilet is free to see in and vise versa ! There were 2 small beds, a TV and a sink the size of a small dinner plate in the room but it was clean at least. The rooms reminded me of the cabins of ferries which cross the north sea from the UK to Germany/Denmark/Holland. Hmmm…rather weird but when I heard that my stepdaughter was asked by a guest where the showers are, I was happy that we at least had a room with a shower inside it. The room also had a roof terrace, would have been nice if this was made up to sit outside and watch the sunsets, it looked like you werent supposed to walk on it. Guess this accomodation suits teenagers and backpackers but the price tag is confusing to say the least.The best about this Acommodation is, that it is in walking distance to some of the places of Interest in NYC. We walked to Central Park, Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue and lots of other areas around which was fun. There is plenty of shops, restaurants, bars and café’s around to enjoy.","North Kelsey, United Kingdom",93,3.0

The shared bathrooms were spotless and I never waited for a vacant one. I sneaked a peek at the other types of rooms when they were being cleaned (rooms were unoccupied) and they were actually quite spacious! The best points about the hotel are the great roof terrace, where we enjoyed a few beers watching the sun go down over New York. Also, the location is superb. Literally 10-15 minuites pleasant walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue and Times Square.

It's an old apartment building or hotel that rebranded itself to serve a different class of customer. I study and write about this sort of thing, so it was right up my alley, and I was kind of looking for an excuse to stay here. When a client needed me to go to NYC for a night, but it wasn't clear whether I or they would be paying for the trip, I took advantage of the chance to economize.Here's what it boils down to. Do you go to a gym? Is it a nice gym? Imagine if that gym then suddenly decided it were a hotel. The smell, the thin carpet, the shared bathroom... It all reminded me of my gym back home.The room I stayed in was tiny---about 6-feet by 8-feet. It had a bunk bed. (Ironically, this is just the size of Bernie Madoff's prison cell at the Manhattan Federal Detention Center. That also had a bunk bed. But at least Bernie had a (semi-)private toilet!)I didn't realize when I booked the room that I'd be sharing the bathroom... My bad, I guess. But I think their website should say very prominently when you make the reservation, ""This room has no bathroom!"" The shared bathroom itself seemed nice, but there's no getting away from the fact you're sharing it with tons of strangers. And, I'm no prima donna. I've been to war, and thus shared much nastier bathrooms (and bathrooms-in-name-only) with a lot of people. But still...Anyway, the furnishings, the smell of sweat and stank, the tiny little sink, even the extreme smell of bleach on the towels---it all reminded me of the locker room at the local Sports Club.I could go on, but here's the thing: I was in NYC on business, and if it weren't for my previous curiosity about this place, I might well have said, ""nuh-uh,"" and gone down the street to spend 3x as much at the Waldorf Astoria. So, I'm probably not really the kind of person they're trying to attract. If you're visiting NYC on a budget, by all means, consider it. I met some very nice people here, none of them from the USA---Japan, Australia, and Sweden. And I wasn't even trying to meet people!The staff was nice. The location is good. The air conditioning didn't work at all, but what do you expect for 1/3 the price of any other nearby hotel?If I were 22 again and backpacking through Europe (or whatever they call the opposite of that, when 22-year-old Europeans travel through the USA), I'd be all over it. If I were an adventurous family on a budget---well, maybe for a night or two.Anyone else, you're better off at a lot of other places in NYC that don't cost much more.","Orange, California",81,3.0

Both rooms were the same size and offered room enough to move around and to store my stuff.The hotel also offers wifi which I am using to write this review right now! I took advantage of the free wifi and got some work done today as well.The only complaint I have is that some people slam their doors and you can hear it in your room. Not sure what the slamming was about but they did quit after 5 mins or so so that's not too big a complaint.The other thing I have noticed over the last couple of visits is that the hotel is showing some signs of use--cracked grout in the bathrooms, dirt in the corners, etc. Nothing too big (believe me I have seen worse in NYC) but things that I hope the hotel mgmt will take care of as soon as possible as this is a very hip looking hotel in a great location and I would hate for it to go down hill.","Dallas, TX",5,4.0

It is close to museums and well known tourist attractions however. The hotel looks great and is clean and well priced. However, the noise transference from the corridor is such that it is very hard to sleep well. The doors have no capacity to shield the room from noise - consequently one hears every single person going to the toilet, slamming doors, having conversations etc. But by FAR the worst is the maids in the morning, who start early and continue all day with extremely loud equipment, banging and crashing of doors etc, but worst of all - very loud conversations with each other - calling from room to room.

We shared a bunk room, which I was a bit concerned about after reading reviews about how small they were, but I must say that the room, although smaller than other hotel rooms I have stayed in, was still comfortable enough for 2 people. We had room 612 on the 4th floor. The room was clean, beds comfortable, air con/heating system worked well, although a bit on the noisy side. Room includes a safe, plenty of towels, hair dryer, ipod docking system and phone. Not much of a view from the room, ours was quite close to the adjacent apartment block. I found the beds comfortable and slept well, and although others have commented that they found the walls thin and noise levels from other guests disturbing I have to say we didnt hear very much from our neighbours at all. The room next door was a couple with a baby, who we could hear crying while we were in the corridor but once in our room we couldnt hear it at all. The traffic noise from outside was also minimal, although we were toward the rear of the building.The bunk rooms don't have a private bathroom but the bathroom light system works well. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor, each with toilet, shower and sink, as well as piped music. I always found them clean, and never had to wait more than a few minutes for one to be available, even first thing in the morning. The side jets were something i have never had in a hotel shower before, was just like a body massage :) My friend did use the bathrooms on the 1st floor at one point and said that 2 of them didnt include showers and were very small apparently. Several people have commented that the lifts are slow, but I have to say we never waited more than about a minute for the lifts at any time. They are on the small side though, probably no more than 6/8 people, less if you have luggage. We did have a quick visit to the roof garden, which i imagine would be nice to sit up there in the summer with a drink. No mobile phone signal up there though. There is also a small garden area on the ground floor which has seating and again would be a nice area to chill at the end of your busy day in the city.Our check in was quick - they do request a deposit on check in - either $100 cash or $50 by credit card which is refunded on check out if you havent incurred any extra charges for the phone etc, and all the staff we spoke to were very pleasant. We rang down for more pillows and a replacement hairdryer and both arrived within a few minutes. I can't comment on the housekeeping as we kept the DND sign on the door during our stay.Check out is 12pm and storage for luggage is available. Free wifi but no other internet access if you dont take a laptop. There is a restaurant attached but we didnt use it so cant comment. There is a supermarket just around the corner on 2nd Avenue and several restaurants/bars. The Morning Star deli is very close and was nice for breakfast. The location is good, E 51st between 2nd and 3rd Avenue, we travelled from JFK by subway to Lex and 3rd and its only 5 - 10 minute walk from the subway to the POD. It is very accesible to all the usual tourist spots. The POd is the 3rd hotel I have stayed in in NYC and I would definately stay here again.",uk,2,4.0

The location was superb but the issue of sharing the bath/ toilet had a lot to be desired as I constantly found them occupied and really messy (often out of toilet paper). A spare roll of toilet paper is provided in your room. Many times I found myself rushing down to different floors to find a vacant bathroom (the toilet & shower are in the same room). I know it was a very busy time for them but with all the extra money they were making (full occupancy at top rates) I would have expected better cleanliness. Would I stay here again? No, I would look elsehwere but for a first timer it was good. It was very pricey for a solo traveller because of New Year so now I know how easy it is to get around I would just stay across the river. One thing I have noticed at these budget hotels is that the staff do not want to engage in a conversation and when you are travelling solo just a few words can make a bg difference. The biggest issue I had was that they took a large deposit from my Visa debit card (about $50 per day) to cover incidentals (even thought they don't have room service or anything- just the phone) and then when the rates changed after New Year they took another couple of hundred even though they had the first few hundred and it took over a week to release all the money back on to my visa debit account (screwing with my budget). They never told me they were going to do that so I was quite annoyed and wrote to the manager about it.","Perth, Australia",43,3.0

The location is superb. Very centrally located in Midtown on East 51st street - just a few minutes walk from Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center and many of the other sights in central New York City. It is also very close to a Subway station.The rooms are small, and mine had a shared bathroom. There are four bathrooms on each floor and usually only one or two of them was occupied at a time so it was not a problem to get a shower or whatever at any time. The bathrooms are beautiful - with great showers and facilities. For me it was not much of an issue that it was shared.In my experience, there was little if any outside noise. The nearby street is not that busy and there was no notable noise from my fellow guests at the hotel. The staff does an excellent job when it comes to cleaning the rooms and the hotel at large generally feels very clean and tidy. The rooms come with a flat-screen TV with 30+ channels and an iPod docking station which I personally never got to use, but seems like a very nifty extra. There's also a small safe in your room that you can use at your convenience, and apparently free WiFi (I didn't bring a laptop).The staff is friendly and wants to help. One cool service is that you can leave your bag at the hotel for a few hours after check out and come back to get it later. For the location, and the general quality of the hotel, the price of the rooms is pretty reasonable. All in all, I would highly recommend The Pod!","Copenhagen, Denmark",219,5.0

Wide range of age groups staying here. I didn't like that the bathroom on my floor was separate room for toilet (no sink) and another room for shower. I think there are other full bathrooms but I didn't go looking. As a single woman in her 40's alone, I felt very comfortable. I was at the hotel from 11:30pm to 7:30 AM.

Even though there are a few comments on here about room size - it isn't too bad if you're on a budget. The decor is stylish and it doesn't feel like a budget hotel at all. We looked for the terrace but no joy and the foyer is well presented. Our corridor wasn't remotely noisey.Personally I found the bathroom situation fine; there are lights above your door the indicate whether they are free or not. The actual bathrooms are clean and I had one of the best showers I've had in years there. Except on one occasion I got locked in and luckily the person I was travelling with heard me shouting, to my embarrassment. The surrounding area is nice. Radio City and Fifth Avenue aren't too far away, the subway which is most conveniently located, the 6, is the most accesible but it isn't the most convenient with regards to location so it can be a longish walk back, even longer, if you've had a long day. But the bars and restaurants, heading towards 2nd, have a great selection of Irish pubs and we had a great nice out.

The hotel is very clean, and we felt perfectly safe walking around the area at night. The staff was also friendly, and - after we checked out - they let us (and many others) store our bags in a room to the side of the lobby for free. We used the room almost exclusively for sleeping , but I did enjoy the small and movable LCD TVs just before bed. The wi-fi is also adequate, and it is certainly fast enough to find an address or to load a metro map. For those who choose the bunk bed option, the shared bathrooms are not a problem. There are four bathrooms on the floor, and one of them is almost always open. Also, there are lights above the door frame that indicate when each bathroom is vacant/occupied, which is a nice feature. While we enjoyed the hotel a lot, I'm not sure how an older person would feel about it (we are both 21). The hotel attracts a young crowd, and it feels a bit like a dormitory. Speakers in the hallways and bathrooms play Indie music all day, and the whole hotel smells like cheap cologne (sort of like Abercrombie and Fitch). But, if you don't mind the youthful feel of the place, which we certainly did not, this hotel is an amazing bargain.As an aside, avoid the bar/restaurant attached to the hotel at all costs.

First of all, it was tiny. I should have known this but I really couldn't believe how tiny it was. I read in another review that it was like an airplane restroom -- that person was spot on. I decided to suck it up and unpack but then I discovered an opened shampoo bottle and when I showered the entire restroom was wet because the shower curtain was crooked. I wanted to cry at this point because I had to spend Valentine's weekend here. I called the front desk right away and they told me that I had to pay for an upgrade but the next upgrade which was a queen sized bed, was essentially the same thing. I was so lost at this point because I was stuck in NYC without any place to go. I called Hotels.com and thankfully someone helped me out. The manager of the Pod was fantastic, he let me decide if I wanted to stay for the rest of the nights or just one. I had to stay the first night because I had already checked in but after that, I could leave. Of course finding another room was a difficult task but thankfully I did find one. The manager also upgraded my bed to a queen size free of charge. The room with the queen sized bed was a little better but not much. I thought the staff handled this very well. I really appreciated their cooperation but it really would have been a disaster if I had to stay here. Don't stay here if you hate those cheap, beige, fleece hotel blankets.

There was some hanging space, some hooks for jackets. There was a sink, and you are also provided with towels, tissues, a hairdryer, and toilet paper (although I have no idea why, as there was always paper in the loos). There is also a desk with a phone. Honestly, the beds weren't the most comfortable I've ever slept on, but they were fine. The individual TVs are a good idea.The shared bathrooms weren't too bad at all, although I have lived in a dorm. We never had to wait for one to become available, we just checked the lights in the room and went to one thats available. There are 4 on every floor, but I only ever used 2. I never had a problem with the cleanliness, except one time another guest had left a glass of liquor in there?!?There were 3 lifts. There were only ever 2 working during our 9 day stay. For the first half it was 1 & 2, then 2 & 3. I have no idea what that was about. Like everything else, they are small inside. It starts getting cosy with about 5 people. I had read about people waiting forever for a lift to come we only had 2 or 3 times like that.Now for my favourite part, the roof top. The hotel is not afraid of telling you about this, but there's no hint of how to get there. So to do that you take the lift to the very top floor, then one of the staircases leads you to the roof. Note, there are 2 staircases, only 1 goes to the roof. We went up at night. We got some food from a deli type place on the corner, Azure. The food was pretty decent, and you pay by lb so it's good for us Aussies with smaller appetites! Anyway, we pulled up a couple of chairs and a little table and enjoyed probably the cheapest meal with a view! Definitely check this out at night.Now for the location. It is about 1.5 blocks to one subway station and 2 blocks to another. It's not too bad, but sometimes after a day of pounding the streets, that block and a half seems like forever!

If you don't mind sharing a very clean bathroom, this is the place for you. The location is fabulous considering there are so many restaurants nearby, a police and fire station within a few steps, and the #6 subway a block over. Like I said previously, the bathrooms are very clean and there are four on each floor. Every morning I saw the cleaning staff switching out the shower curtains for new, clean ones. *Check out the third bathroom though bc it's much bigger and the shower is almost spa quality. Also make sure you check out the rooftop patio! There are plenty of chairs to have a nice relaxing moment above the city. Both times I have stayed the rooms were extremely clean and although very small for a single bed, I didn't see this as a problem at all. I actually think it's super cozy.

For the first four nights I was in a double room with a private bath and I really enjoyed it. However to save money I moved into a single with the shared bath for the remainder of my trip and found it to be equally as pleasing. The bathrooms were always available, as there are four on the floor, the bathrooms are literally outside your room, and they were always clean.

I'd exchanged a few emails with the hotel about various upgrades from the ""Double"" room that had been booked. In their reply they always quoted a higher cost than the price listed on the website - And always in short sharp and almost rude emails. This set my expectations of the service really low.We arrived and went to our room. Small as expected. The bathroom however was not as expected. The sliding glass door gave the option of shielding the toilet area but left a clear glass view into the shower (umm peep show anyone) It also meant the room got lots of early morning light from the bathroom.... Not great for holidays sleep ons!When it came to bed time the bed linen was so creased I really wasn't sure if it had been changed or not from the last guest. There was clearly a stain on the pillow that could be seen through the pillow case. The thin blanket really didn't do a lot for comfort on the small and oddly positioned bed. Next morning we decided to check out 4 days early. the front desk showed no interest into why, our departure was as brisk, cold and rude as all of the other contact we had previously had with the hotel. be warned, the double rooms are really not designed for two adults unless you are comfortable with no real division between the bedroom and bathroom and you don't mind climbing over each other to get out of bed, or banging your head or feet on the oddly positioned furniture.To be honest based on the rates for the pod v's other trendy hotels there is better value to be had in manhattan.","Dublin, Ireland",25,2.0

It's worth noting that the nearest tube station is the stop that you will need to connect you to the airtrain for JFK airport.The hotel itself was fab. We had a double room on the 9th floor which was very compact but had enough space for storage and absolutely fine for putting your head down each night.

We had a TV with a variety of channels on it, and a radio/ipod docking station. The ensuite was compact also, but perfectly manageable and the shower was quite powerful.Hotel facilities don't really go beyond the room you are staying in. They had a concierge who provided lots of useful information (attractions, transport info, savings vouchers etc) and hotel porters to take luggage to your room, as well staff on reception, which I felt was a good standard for a 2* hotel.We had no issues with noise from either inside or outside the hotel (and we stayed over New Years!). You can hear neighbours coming and going, but the hotel didn't appear to attract the party-goers that you may think would be attracted to the prices it offers! Instead there were a number of international visitors and the age range of guests varied considerably.There's a single vending machine for drinks within the hotel but other than that you will need to head out for food. This isn't a problem as there's a million places to eat in New York. We ate quick breakfasts in a great little cafe around the corner called Liberty Cafe (& Taco Bell). Don't be put off by Taco Bell! They have a small kiosk at the back of the cafe but I never actually saw it open. Liberty Cafe sells a range of hot breakfast foods, cereals, yogurts, sandwiches, panini's and pizzas (and salads if you really want...) at good prices for NYC.All in all a great place to stay if you want a hotel that's clean and modern at hostel prices.Def check out the roof terrace of the hotel at day or night!

It's near some really good restaurants in every price range too. The two problems I found had nothing to with the hotel itself. The first was parking. Well it's New York, so you either have to circle the block to find a park or pay a pretty high fee. I'd suggest public transportation once you get there.

We (2 of us) opted to stay in this hotel after reading the reviews in many websites including Tripadvisor. We had a budget in mind and opted for this hotel, considering the good reviews, location and availability factor. On the whole, we do consider our stay at this hotel as a very pleasant experience.Details:1) Effective Utilization of SpaceWe booked the ""Bunk Bed Room"" for the 2 of us. The rooms are small, yet adequate - in short -> ""effective utilization of space"", considering the available space in the room. 2) UtilitiesRoom had towels, napkins, soap, trash can, hair dryer, phone, notepad with pen, Ihome, hangers, hooks and included a small safe as well. AC / Heater was in working condition as well (even though the heater took a little while to turn on - however this was not much of a problem and hence did not bring it up with the room service). There is a small TV nearby each bed, and there are indicators in the room to tell you if the restrooms are occupied or vacant (reminds you about the ones in the flight - in fact you can also see the ""occupied/vacant"" sign on the restroom doors as well). The blankets and covers were all in excellent condition. Wi-Fi worked well too in the room. 2 beds had adequate clearance as well. Room also had a small wash and mirror.3) Visuals and Others: The overall fragrance in the walkways and the hotel is good - trendy lobby, Wi-Fi access is available in the lobby if you have a laptop. The walkways between the rooms are relatively small in width, and there are chances that you might hear sounds from the walkways a little louder than you might expect. Clean restrooms - would consider the service as excellent (never had a problem with the availability of restrooms - had 4 of them in our floor). Interestingly, music is played in the restrooms and sounded to be of global/international genre. Rooftop has good views too. Front desk, room service and operator who takes care of shuttle/car service were friendly and helpful. They have a luggage storage facility too in the lobby. 4) Neighbourhood and Location:Calm and peaceful neighbourhood - we had to rely on a nearby store at 11.00 pm to get a bottle of mineral water -> there was a store open just around the corner and the frontdesk helped us with this info (the hotel has a vending machine, but don't think they had water :-) ). We also opted for the Indian hotel (named ""Amma"") and the foodstore ""Pax"" nearby. There are other restaurants (Mexican cuisine and others) and foodstores (McDonald, Starbucks etc) nearby as well. Subways and bus stops are also nearby and cabs are available as well.Hope this information would be of help -> enjoy your stay !!",California,1,4.0

It's got that inexpensive, no frills, youthful style thing going for it.The hipster feel is present right from the moment you walk in to the lobby with its large pop art mural and new age inspired furniture. While the front desk staff weren't exactly the friendliest I've met, the concierge was quite helpful with suggestions on what to do and where to eat.While the rooms are extremely small, they are quite well thought out. There's just about enough storage space for two small boxes and a clothes rack. While the bunk bed rooms don't have attached loos, they do have a small wash basin and a mirror. My bunk bed room had small TVs and reading lights on each level, which lets both people in the room do their own thing without disturbing the other. Be warned though, the walls are paper thin. Sound carries very very well in the Pod, so you might want to keep the volume down when there.Some of you might be uncomfortable with the thought of sharing bathrooms, but you'll find it works out quite well after all. They are almost always clean and with 3 of em on each floor, there really isn't too much waiting required either.The hotel's definitely a no-frills sort of place with no room service, no free amenities and no business center. If you are travelling with a laptop, however, they have very fast and very reliable wi-fi available in each room. Definite plus that. The location's pretty good too, with a subway stop right down the road and a lot of great attractions within walking distance. Food is also pretty easily available, but not always the most affordable thanks to the offices around. Try the Madison diner on 1st Av for slightly expensive, but delicious & filling American style breakfasts.So if you're looking for a clean, modern, no frills hotel with a young-ish vibe in NYC, try the Pod. It might just work out perfectly for you.","Bengaluru, India",30,3.0

The lobby is great and upscale. We showed up the day after a night of snow and they had not completely cleared the sidewalk in front of the entrance, but that may have had more to do with where the taxi dropped us off. The rooms are small, but due to the floor plan it is easy to forget how small the room is. That is, the lay out is great. We stayed in a double for two nights. There was plenty of storage for clothing and storage of suitcases. I thought the shower and bathroom were great. The mattress was not great from a comfort standpoint, but for just a few a nights it was fine. To clarify, it is not uncomfortable but I can guarantee you've probably slept on something better. As a warning, the Pod is seemingly popular with tour groups and such. It can be loud at times and the noise can be disturbing at night, but it is not overwhelming. The concierge is okay, but nothing special. Hotel employees were helpful, but nothing out of the ordinary. Service could have been better, but it was adequate. The location is okay, as it is a short and easy walk to shopping, the Rockefeller Center, etc. Additionally, there are a few nice bars on the same block as the hotel. On the other hand, there aren't many nice restaurants around, but there are places to eat. Chin Chin is good, but way overpriced. The Morningstar around the corner has good breakfast. The French Restaurant next to the hotel is good and I would recommend it, but I think the concierge desk has a deal to send guests there. You will need to take a taxi to get to Chinatown, SoHo, Museum Mile, Lower Manhattan, etc. You'll have to walk a few blocks generally before you easily catch a taxi. Overall, the Pod offers great value and I would highly recommend it for travelers on a budget, both young and old.","Saint Louis, Missouri",7,3.0

The POD is one of those hotels that do.The Pod Hotel takes the fact that they have very small rooms and turns that into a fun theme. Each room is a ""pod"". Their rooms are very similar to rooms on a cruise ship. Some of the rooms share bathrooms. Our room had its own bathroom and was 30$ more than rooms without bathrooms. There was a full size bed, a small desk, about a foot of space on 3 sides of the bed, a tiny shower and toilet. There was a recess in the wall next to the bed with a tiny sink. There were no cupboards, but there was space to hang coats behind the door and storage space under the bed.The room was minimalist and designed to save cost without coming across as cheap (like some motels are). They had free wifi, which worked when I needed it to on Friday but did not work well over the weekend. There was a small LCD TV mounted in the corner of the room. There was a roof top that had a good view of other, taller buildings on all sides.There were restaurants all around the block the POD is in and it is squarely in the middle of midtown. It is a 15-20 minute walk to Grand Central station and 25-35 minute taxi ride to La Guardia airport.We did not interact much with the hotel staff, save for check in and check out, so we cannot comment on the friendliness or helpfulness of the staff. There were far more traffic in the lobby of this hotel than other hotels I've visited, which gave the impression that there were many guests and rooms in the hotel. I guess that goes with the city.There were a couple of issues. The sheer density of people in this hotel leads to higher levels of noise pollution. On Saturday night there were some very loud people singing/talking/yelling in the corridors. A man, apparently disturbed by the ruckus opened his door and yelled ""SHUT UP"" or something to that effect. People who do not have bathrooms in their room walk to and from shared bathrooms all night. You might see someone in their pajamas or less walking to a bathroom.The hotel did not have an internet room/business center/shared printer/free breakfast and many other frills one gets used to at other motels/hotels.I solved these problems by wearing ear-plugs and spending most of the day seeing the city.",Milwaukee,5,4.0

Safe wasn't working when we got to the room...within minutes of calling the front desk, someone came and sorted it out straight away, and declined a tip!! The rooms aren't massive, but that just means less space to spread stuff around and it really is only a place to sleep, not spend hours of your day in. We had a double room with shower/toilet cubicle. Great! It was clean, beds made daily and fresh towels provided, and the room always smelt lovely afterward! The bed was a little short for me (being 6ft 3) but curled up and slept fine...especially after 12 hour days on my feet! Some great eating places within surrounding blocks (the Morning Star cafe particularly for quick Breakfasts!)

I switched to the Pod during a business trip, and this was heads above 6 Columbus (where I was before moving), which cost three times more. I usually travel for business, and the next time I am in New York, I will book myself and my colleagues at the Pod. Yes, it's small, but not really any smaller than the shoe boxes I've paid hundreds of dollars for in Manhattan. It was clean and comfortable, and within walking distance to the metro, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, and MoMA. I opted for a room with its own bathroom. The shower was great--squeaky clean with great pressure (I can't say the same for some other places I've stayed at, and at a much higher price).It's not as close as other, more expensive places, to where I need to be to work, but with the hundreds of dollars I'm saving on the hotel, some $10 cab rides here and there don't matter. Also, in the more expensive places (such as 6 Columbus), I had no desk, no internet, hardly any toiletries, and no place to store my luggage. At the Pod, I had all of those things, and at a third of the price.There are lots of great restaurants in the area, or if you want to grab something quickly, there is a deli/salad bar a few blocks away.My only small complaint was that the elevators were extremely slow, and I ended up taking the stairs. Not a problem if you're on a lower floor, like I was, though I think the place is up to 10 stories tall. Oh, and no way to make coffee in-room, but that's to be expected--it's minimalist. It's just hard to get going without it, is all.My husband and I are coming back to NYC in a few months, and I most likely will book us at the Pod.","Pigeon Forge, Tennessee",1,5.0

I was worried that my 60 year old mom might think it was a bit shabby staying in bunk beds (and she did at first) but the beds were so comfortable, the room so clean and the shared loos fantastic (the little lights in the room to tell you which ones are free are ingenious!). At the end of the stay she was taking a stack of cards to give onto friends. The other thing thats handy is that you each have a seperate tv and reading light in the bunks so that you can watch tv/ read when you cant sleep with jetlag without disturbing the person youre traveling with. This is so much more reasonable than anywhere else to stay in New York (especially if you are travelling alone which I was during my last stay) and centrally located to boot. Theres a fantastic bagel place (Ess a bagel) around the corner and its only a block or two to the nearest subway station. Its only 5 or 6 blocks to St. Patricks and 5th avenue and not much further to Times Square.

The hotel is only about 5 blocks east of Rockafeller Center, Saks Fifth Avenue, etc. During December, that area is a bit of a zoo with thousands of tourists everywhere.

I booked on Expedia for about $70 a night, and I stayed 4 nights. For the price, it couldn't be beat and I really couldn't have been happier with my stay. Especially since I couldn't split the price of the room with anyone to defray the cost of a more expensive place.But I'm finally taking my mom to NYC for her birthday in Feb '10 (she's always wanted to go and never has), and I briefly thought about staying here again since I know the neighborhood and subway system really well, but I decided against it. So here's a list of the good and not really bad, but not really good things about The Pod Hotel.**The Good**- The smallness of the room is not as off-putting as I was afraid it might be. But I was so glad it was just me in there... a second person would have been claustrophobic. - The location was phenomenal--surpassed my expectations in terms of convenience. There were two subway stops within 2 blocks, and one of them was the E Train at the Lexington station and it'll connect you to wherever you want to go.- There is a sink in the room which ended up being way more convenient than I thought.- The heater wasn't working in my room, but maintenance came very quickly and fixed that (they also brought me extra pillows upon request).- It's easy to get to and from JFK using the E train subway and AirTrain.- No hints of bedbugs (or roaches) anywhere! I always check the bottom edges of the mattress of every hotel I go to for bed bugs, and the mattress was clean. (It only takes one bed bug to create an infestation because they're asexual, and since I used to live in a ghetto apartment building that was infested with pigeons that transmitted the bedbugs from building to building, I take this very seriously.)**The Not So Good (But I Wouldn't Necessarily Say Bad)**- The bathrooms aren't in the rooms (at least for most rooms). From what I understand, there are two bathrooms per floor. However, whenever I went to use one, one was always available. And I do mean one out of the two, because one was always in use as well.- Even though they're really nice communal bathrooms (rain showerheads and updated fixtures), there was NO space to actually put my clothes. No countertops or anything. So bring a plastic bag or something to hang on the wall hook to put your clothes in. - Printing out my itinerary the night before my flight was kind of a nightmare. They didn't have any kind of business center (even though there was a really nice desk area in the lobby that would be the perfect setup for a computer with internet access and a printer). When I asked if they could print it for me at the front desk, they tried to work with me (but made it known that this was beyond the call of duty). Maybe this isn't that big of a deal, but printing out my boarding pass that night ended up being the difference between me catching my flight and missing the plane. As it turned out the next morning, I was the last one to board my plane after running all the way through the airport with my luggage (weighed down by books from Comic Con and had an asthma attack along the way).- The hotel advertised that there was a channel where you could see if the bathroom was occupied before you went down to use it, and that was a false claim. My TV had no channel. When I asked the front desk, they didn't know what I was talking about.**Tips if you stay at this hotel**- Bring a pair of dollar store flip flops for trips to the bathroom and for use in the shower. (Don't forget a plastic bag to hang your clothes in as well, see above).- The E train subway will take you everywhere you need to go or connect you where you need to go. This is seriously a great train for New York Comic Con because the convention center is on the E train route. All in all, the Lexington/53rd St station is a great connection spot.- Be prepared that the ""free high speed wireless internet"" is kind of a joke. It is free. It is wireless. It is very, very slow. Since the only channels that came in on the TV were antenna ones (and static-y channels at that), I tried watching an episode of Damages on hulu and the internet connection couldn't handle it. I mean, I didn't do anything but sleep in my room (cuz I was out at 8AM and back at 11PM), but I can never just fall asleep at 11 p.m., so having no TV was kind of a disappointment.- Since the only chair is an uncomfortable desk chair to sit in, if you wanna watch TV and unwind, ask for 2 additional pillows to support your back and use your bed as a couch (they brought them up super fast and it wasn't any trouble).- There's a sandwich place at the top of the block and it's really affordable, and you can easily take your food to go.",Los Angeles,6,4.0

We had a double private bath which was perfect for us but I popped my head in the shared showers on our floor and it was also clean and tidy. The hotel doesnt have that tired look that so many hotels can have no matter how nice or clean - i just hope they keep it updated and maintained. It felt safe and comfortable enough that as a girl i would be happy to stay here on my own. For breakfast we recommend the Morning Star Diner - when you come out of the hotel turn right and then right again (on 2nd) and its just there. Really cheap and friendly and a proper diner experience (which is what we were looking for). Overall a great hotel; just what we were looking for; cheap, safe, funky, good location, clean rooms and bathrooms with a safe. Would we go there again??? YES wihout a doubt!",Liverpool,4,5.0

From the reviews I was expecting no room to move but with the beds there was also a desk, storage space and a sink with towels, tissues etc. It was very well laid out and very clean. The light indicators to show you which bathrooms were in use is very handy and on our floor every bathroom had a toliet and a shower. I was expecting bare minimum and had brought towels, shampoo and shower gel all of which were provided. The staff were very friendly and helped us arrange transport to the airport.

It helped that the hotel had been very recently renovated when I first went - it was extraordinarily clean. I just loved the fashionable shower in my room and the iPod alarm clock! The second time, I stayed in a room with a shared bathroom; the room was clean but not as shiny-clean as my first room in January, and the bathroom was reasonably clean. I only used the bathroom to take one shower, as I only stayed one night.The room was serviced without fail during my first stay, which lasted five days.

We had some issues with this hotel as they had apparently cancelled our reservation. I had called them in advance in order to let them know that we will arrive some time during the night/early morning and that they should make sure that we are not considered a no-show for not arriving before midnight. When we arrived early morning at the hotel (we actually arrived at 7 am and not, as planned, at 5 am) there was no ""welcome to the Pod Hotel"" or anything like that. During check-in it turned out that they had obviously given away our room to somebody else and have thus earned twice the money with the same room. We did however get a room immediately but the front desk manager was very unfriendly and gave us the feeling that we made a mistake and that we should actually be happy to get a room at all because we didn't show up the day before. We found his behaviour very unprofessional and inapropriate and it left us with the impression that he is not aware of the effect the first impression has on the overall experience. It would have seemd reasonable to me that the hotel maybe reimbursde us for the one night that we actually didn't stay at the hotel (which they sold a second time) and in any good standard hotel the attentive front staff employee would have given us at least complimentary breakfast or something.There were only 2 very small and slow elevators for 14 floors because one was serviced during our stay. The corridors are narrow and not well lit and (at least on our floor) there was a moldy and dingy smell. Our air-condition did not work but the night clerk (a red-haired guy who was very friendly) gave us another room immediately.The rooms are very small and it felt like a small cabin on a cruise ship.The price that we paid was (borderline) ok. What was really irritating in this hotel was the lack of service and the absence of hospitality. It should rather be called hostel than hotel. It is just not a place where you feel comfortable in the room and can spend hours just at the hotel.The wireless network did not work during our stay.

This is our 3rd trip to Manhattan this year. We've also traveled to Milan, Italy and Las Vegas during this spring. To be honest, this has also been a slow year of traveling for us.I decided to try the Pod Hotel after reading about the hotel in magazines, Yelp.com, and Tripadvisor.com. We stayed for 3 days and 2 night. We had a queen-sized room with a private bath.The hotel is is modern and trendy.Our 1st impression about the room, was ""AWESOME !!!!"". We were instantly reminded of our trips to Europe. The room was minuscule. The bathroom was tiny. But the room was stylish, well-designed, and clean.However, 3 things prevent me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating:1. Internet never worked: I unsuccessfully called the hotel's technical support 3x during our stay. The hotel's wireless router was rebooted several times. We could never stay connected to the internet for more than a few minutes. This issue also happened after midnight. :( Yes, even on vacation, we need the internet to find parks, restaurants, subway-routes, etc. :)2. Two of the 3 elevators did not work.3.

It was very roomy for my husband, child and myself with a queen bed and a twin with trundle. I liked that the room had a little area with the twin bed/trundle with a child size table with two small bean bag cube chairs. It was as if my daughter had her own little room (no door though). The room had a large standard hotel bathroom with tub/shower and a door for privacy as opposed to the other Pod rooms that I read about.There was a large desk that was maybe 5 feet long with plenty of light and electrical plugs. I had no problem getting wifi and getting a little work done here. Only one time I couldn't get a wifi connection so I went down to the comfortable lobby. In the room there was also a closet with iron and ironing board and safe. The safe never worked and I think it was missing a battery. I forgot to report it. There was a large flat screen Tv on the wall that was visible from all the beds.The townhouse rooms are in a separate building and it is a walk up a narrow and steep set of stairs. Ours overlooked the back courtyard and was very quiet. We could observe the many people eating breakfast in the courtyard each morning from one of the three windows in the room. The hotel is located in a great area close to many restaurants on 2nd Street and a great take out or picnic supply store on 3rd (or was it Lex?) and E 51st called Allure. We thought about getting breakfast to go one morning and sitting in the little park across from the hotel next to the synagogue, but never got to do it. Maybe next time. There was a great Belgian restaurant, appropriately called BXL, that was just a few doors to your left as you exit the Pod. One night they had a great $20 all you can eat mussels special including one Stella Artois beer. Not bad deal for NYC or anywhere.We usually stay closer to Times Square in a fancier hotel, but for the price and size of the room for 3 people this was a great choice. Our favorite Times Square hotel wanted to charge us about another $150 per night for having a third person!  At first I thought the location was a little far from everything, but once we discovered the great restaurants on 2nd Street we were hooked. We ate breakfast once at the Pod, once at Allure (tables upstairs) and then everyday at the diner on 2nd called Morningstar. One of our favorite dinner was at Lasagna on 2nd and we ran into a nice German couple from the hotel there. They were happy with the restaurant as well.I think families with small kids would feel comfortable here. Just make sure you are okay walking up and down narrow stairs as that is the only way up to the townhouse pods. At least you don't have to deal with the slow elevators I read about in the main building. They had great bellmen to haul your luggage up the stairs. We loved Rafael and Marco.

It was fine, but nothing better. If you are AT ALL claustrophobic, or enjoy being able to walk around the bed in your hotel room, without having to crawl over it because there is a suitcase in the room, its not for you.Our first room (a double with a bathroom cubicle) smelled strongly of damp and made us feel like we weren't clean after taking showers. Note: don't share a room with someone you are not 100% comfortable with seeing (and hearing) you shower and use the toilet... the bathrooms are glass-walled and there is zero privacy; though there are additional showers and toilets in the halls. After the second night, we asked to change rooms as the smell was overpowering. The second room smelled fine, but the air conditioner was broken and the room was hotter than hell. They had fixed a little replacement one to the window, but that sounded like a jet engine in the room so would not have made for sound sleep. We called the front desk again and after sending the hotel handy man up to take a look, they finally agreed to give us a Queen room (that was both cool and odour-free). That room was absolutely fine, so my advice would be to push the boat out a little and spend the extra on a Queen. The Pod is fine, and good for the budget-conscious (which we are) but it not THAT much cheaper than other hotels in Manhattan that have space, privacy and basic comforts. Pro: the free wifi.

We were expecting small but this really was teeny. First room we check in to was smelly as the toilet was broken and had overflowed in to the room and the roaches were out on mass. The room was changes with no issues and the 2nd room was a mirror image to the first, except it was clean. No wardrobe or storage so was dressing out of a suitcase and there wasnt a seperate bathroom, but a shower in the room which you could touch from the bed.The place seemed like a hostel as due to budgets there were a lot of younger guests and the walls were very thin, so we could hear what everyone was doing. Thankfully we stayed here for only 3 nights before moving to the Marriott in Time Square - any longer and I think it would have been too much.As a place to stay in NYC this was acceptable and served its purpose as somewhere to sleep and want to be in easy walking distance of Central Park, Time Square etc. There is a great French restaurant a couple of doors along from the hotel which I would definately recommend and eat in again.

This past weekend only one of them was working (I think they reserve one for the staff as the third elevator can be heard moving, but I never saw it open in three days). 2. The bed itself is not really comfortable...rather firm for my liking. 3. The sink in the room is so small, you WILL splash yourself every time you turn it on. Its like a baby sink!

I have stayed in really expensive chic hotels, and I have stayed in ones that weren't so great. I read a lot of reviews for the pod before making a reservation, but I was a little nervous to see what it was like in MY opinion. I read reviews that made it seem like the best place ever. I also read the ones that make it sound terrible. I don't think I am too picky-I would say right in the middle, and if anything i'm more on the easygoing and flexible side. I went there with a 100% open mind. When I arrived (an hour earlier then check in) on a very rainy Thursday, I asked if it was too soon to check in. Thank goodness it wasn't! The man at the front desk was very friendly, and gave me the key to my single room. Now, I had lived on a college campus, and had a single room which was the size of a bathtub, so I didn't think it could be worse than that. I was plesantly surprised when I opened the door to my room. It was immaculate. It smelled very very clean. It looked wonderful. The size was absolutely perfect for one person. Anything more would have been a waste of space-I didn't need it! I wanted to check out the ""shared bathrooms""...I pictured it, again, like college...5 showers in a row..no privacy. I was completely wrong. You basically went into your own room. It had a toilet, sink, and shower. All to yourself. So yes, other people can use it..but when it was called a ""shared"" bathroom, I thought it was something else. So this bathroom was extremely clean. Like..cleaner than my bathroom probably is. I was absolutely impressed. Also, with 4 bathrooms on the floor, I wondered if waiting for a bathroom would ever be an issue. It wasn't. There are lights above the door in your bedroom that let you know what bathroom is occupied. I never saw more then 2 lights lit at any point in time. I talked to a lot of people on Thursday and Friday (When my stay was), and each one that I talked to-I raved about the hotel.

Yes the rooms may be small, but we weren't coming to NY to spend the whole week in our hotel room. Even so, when we did spend time in our room, it wasn't cramped or uncomfortable. The bed was lovely and comfortable, the drawers underneath were great for storing everything and the iPod alarm clock was a great bonus. Can't comment on the communal bathrooms as we had a private bathroom, but ours was more than adequate for our needs - loved the shower. Due to the small size of the room though, it may be best if you go with somebody you're comfortable with! A private bathroom may be a little close for comfort in some cases. The staff were absolutely fantastic too, very friendly and even the other guests too were very nice. The Pod is in a perfect location too. Subway station at the end of the block and only a 15 minute walk away from Times Square/Rockafeller Center etc. You couldn't ask for a better location at such a cheap price.

The only option that appears of interest is a room with shared bath room: although lacking in proper ventilation, these corridor bathrooms are prettier and much more spacey than the ones crammed into private rooms and you could save on your expenses in case that is your priority. In no event, however, should you book a double room with shower and toilet: you 2 will be sleeping on something resembling the undersized sofa bed that your old aunt keeps on her tiny attic where you have no place no to put your suitcase without stumbling over it. The difference being that your auntie will not charge some US$ 200 including taxes per night. Perhaps that such prices made sense before the economic crisis but these days you can get much better value for the same money in Manhattan: for the same amount we had a complete apartment in the Beekman Tower Hotel on East 49 including full bathroom and kitchen, dining, living and separate bedroom. The furniture may be old-fashioned, the TV’s may not be flat-screen and the lounge may not be brimming with young people clutching to their laptops, but you can actually run around your rooms, will not suffer the noise of guests and cleaners in the corridors and your geographical location will be as privileged. And, oh yes: the i-net connection is much better at the Beekman!! That bugged me more than anything else: how can the POD of all places not have the swiftest connection?!

We paid extra for an en suite double room. I have mixed feelings about this place so ill split them into positives and negatives ...Positives - loved the location, easy walking distance within about 15 minutes to Times Square - 10 to 5th Avenue, 5 minutes to a subway station. Excellent Morningside Diner or Pax a few blocks away for breakfasts, loved the helpful concierge that seemed more like an old friend - nothing was too much trouble, bright colourful rooms - very clean and cleaned daily. Comfortable small beds. Good storage (which you need as rooms are so small) Nice touches with the ipod dock - but would not dare play music too loud - see negatives. Negatives - REALLY noisy, we could hear every word the VERY loud Calfornians (We know this because they told us - unknowingly) through the door - including them peeing in their bathroom, also our room was opposite the bathrooms so doors slamming all night long along with the drunken coming and goings all night did not lead to much sleep. I slept really badly while here and even got some earplugs. The room was really small, and the bathroom although funky was tiny - and was partitioned from the main room with a thin (see through !!) glass door, with a huge gap in it - so it felt as if you were literally sitting at the end of the bed doing your business - i hated this and actually ended up using the communal bathrooms (Which are very nice by the way!). Me and my boyfriend know everything about one another but theres just some things you dont want them to see!!! Me and my boyfriend found we were whispering all the time and listening to the TV on the lowest setting - felt as if you were living on top of strangers all the time. I hated this ... I also hated the hostel feeling of the place- maybe im too old - i can imagine its great if you are having a girly / lads weekend ... but its not good for a romantic break. Im afraid ive been really spoilt in the past and usually stay at the Crowne Plaza in New York but we decided to stay here to have some extra money for shopping. I dont think we would stay here again.

I've stayed at The Pod several times. My experiences have been generally good. However my stay on March 20th/21st will be my last. The room had a musty smell which you can get rid of by opening a window. No problem. The room space is smartly designed. However the thin walls have always been a problem but its a small price to pay. Again, no problem The shared bath experience is okay. I mean, that's part of the deal. But noisy neighbors? Big problem. It's a bigger problem when the hotel staff does nothing to stop it. Several people down the hall were playing loud music & partying in their room (how can you party in a room that's about the size of a shoebox!). One party guest couldn't hear her friend on her cell so she took the call out into the hallway for all to hear! Ridiculous. There was competing noise when some decided to open their windows to scream & laugh at 2:30am. When I complained to the front desk, nothing was done.

Each room also includes an ipod docking station, ours was unfortunately malfunctioning.The bunk bed pods use shared bathrooms (which is why the in-room sink was so useful) and we found that the bathrooms were clean and convenient. Our pod included a little sign over the door indicating which restrooms were occupied, which was very useful for planning showers and such. The elevators were a little bit slow, especially during ""rush"" hours, but this is pretty common in many older New York buildings, so it didn't bug us much. There are brightly colored murals on the wall and music plays in the hallways and bathrooms. The location was great, it is on the east side in midtown, and is quite close to several subway lines (notably the E and the 6).

As a result the guests can be little louder and rowdier than one might want, but I can't fault the hotel for appealing so strongly to it's demographic.

Overall the experience was very good. The rooms are VERY small and basically a place to just lay your head for the night. I would only recommend this place for couples or solo travelers. Bad idea for family members or anyone looking for privacy while showering, changing clothes or going to the bathroom LoL. The in-room bathroom situation is rather awkward as it's just a clear glass shower right next to the bed. So whoever is in the room with you is going to see you naked while you shower, or listen to you go to the bathroom...there's just no getting around it. There are shared bathrooms out in the hallway which you can use however if one becomes available.The hotel has the potential to be very noisy. Luckily we had no neighbors next to us so we didn't hear any noise...But just as an example: I was watching TV in our room with the volume turned up a quarter of the way. I ended up having to go down to the lobby for something. When I left the room I could hear the TV playing in my room all the way down at the other end of the hall by the elevators. Obviously there's very little insulation in the rooms.The one thing that was a little annoying was the location of the hotel if you were wanting to go to Times Square. The Hotel is about 12-13 blocks from Times Square which is a little too far to walk and a little too close to take the subway. If you take the subway there is no direct route to Times Square-42nd Street. You actually have to take 2 separate trains to get there due to the location of the hotel and it's probably faster to just walk it which can take about 20 minutes. With that being said there are a couple of subway terminals just a flew blocks from the hotel with easy access to most of the city...as well as several eatery's that are rather good. I know it's sort of lame to complain about having to walk a mile or so to a New York destination like Times Square since you're going to be doing so much walking anyway...that's why this was only a minor gripe.","North Palm Beach, Florida",28,4.0

The location is perfect smack in the middle of Manhattan with all kinds of transportation at your fingertips. We had a single pod room and a queen pod room. Both rooms were extremely small and extremely well appointed - just like a cabin on a ship og aboard a night train. The single room had no bath - you had to use the corridor bath which was very clean with fresh towels and piped music. This arrangement led to one of us beeing dragged out of bed by a naked man wearing a very tiny towel and begging us to call the reception to be let into hos room where the door had locked as he took a shower in the corridor. We started to hope it would happen again as the man was rather attractive but were dissapointed. The reception people were efficcient if not friendly and the room staff were warm and easy-going. The only real draw-back was the fact that you could get no breakfast - so in the morning you had to get out into the cold bright busy New York streets to hunt for somewhere to eat. There is a diner quite the old-fashioned type you see in films with stalls and so on called the Morning Star in the vicinity. It has quite an hysterical athmosphere and you are asked to leave the second you finish your food. A brutal start on the day. Also - the hotel is pretty expensive. But all in all - The Pod Hotel is a nice aquaintance. I would gladly stay there again.,"Munich, Germany",88,4.0

The bathroom floor gets wet because they don't provide bath mats, if this is a problem for you make sure to wear shoes. Our only problem was the noise. We could hear quite clearly what the people in the next room were saying. One guy even turned his TV up really loud and then went out at 11pm.

The lifts took forever and as was on the 2nd floor quicker to use the stairs. Seemed to attract noisy clientele - at one point felt like I was back at college, could hear people talking and running around at 3am etc. You can hear what is going on in the next room and if the bathrooms are next to you, the pipes are noisy too. Heating was centralised (no control in room) so it was hot as hell. Had to open the bathroom window for air. View outside window of concrete floor - nice. They have speakers in the hallways with music and for some reason this came on at 5:30am and reception advised they couldn't turn it off! Annoying.

I stayed in the Pod Hotel in May 2008 for 5 nights and found it to be a great place to stay.After quickly realising just how expensive hotels in NYC actually are and coming to the conclusion I would basically be only using my room for sleeping; I decided I would have to lower my expectations from a 3/4 star hotel to a budget operation. This led me to come across The Pod Hotel. As I was not keen on the idea of staying in a hostel, the pod hotel offered a great economic alternative by operating a shared bathroom system but with the privacy of your own bedroom. I opted for the bunk bed room with shared bathroom. I arrived at the hotel early evening and found check in was both quick and easy. Our room was very small, but as i spent very little time in it, it did not cause much if a problem. It was also very well looked after and clean. In the room were two single beds in the form of a bunk bed set up (each with it's own fold out 10'' tv) a sink area and desk with a phone and ipod docking station, as well as a signalling system above the door to indicate which of the floors four bathrooms were free. One of my major concerns about The Pod Hotel was how clean the bathrooms would be, seeing as there were 4 on the floor to share with the 10-12 or so rooms. My fears were unfounded as throughout my whole time there the bathrooms were always in excellent condition, so much so that you would think you were the only one using it! Now for the location. If you are a fairly fit person, it is within 30 mins walking distance of a number of attractions such as the rockefeller, empire state, central park, times square, grand central. I found the immediate area to be very safe and relatively quiet (we had a room at the back of the hotel and had no trouble with noise). There are a number of fast food places/café's around the corner on 2nd ave, including a mcdonalds, but you may have to travel a bit further to find a vast array of quality restaurants. Whilst the price would afford you luxury in a lot of other places worldwide, by NYC standards it offers superb value for money and people should take this into consideration when marking this hotel. In summary this is a great place for people who are looking for a basic and cheap base to explore NY from.","Merseyside, United Kingdom",15,5.0

Space inside the room is TINY - no more than 90 sq. ft. including the toilet/bath area (so you can imagine how small the actual room is). But everything works in its own way: from the airplane looking stainless sink, sleek see through stand-up shower, functional bed with storage drawers underneath and the practical desk area (a phone and an iPod sound system). My favorite part is the stand-up shower/toilet area, very modern lookig with a tiny bit of desinger's touch. Bed is comfortable and clean with bedding sheet changed daily.Location. This hotel sits on E51 between 3rd and 2nd St. on Upper Midtown East. Subway Line 6 is about one and a half block away and Subway Line E & V are about 2 blocks away so it is quite convenient. There is no restaurant inside the hotel but tons of dining options are available in the immediate area: check out PAX (sandwich/salad haven), Azure (self serve buffet market) and a number of ethnic restaurants nearby (E51 as well as 2nd). There are even a bar and a chic lookig restaurant outside the hotel on either side of the street.Hotel premise. The buidling has obviously gone through a mjaor overhaul and was turned into a boutique style hotel. The lobby is spacious and decorated with IKEA style furniture - mordern yet somewhat cheap looking. During my 4-day stay, I had seen tons of young hotel guests gathering in the lobby. I never used the area myself but can imagine it would be a great meeting point. Amenities and service. Basic bathroom cleaning supplies is pretty much what you get. There is not even an ice machine in the hotel. But all rooms come with a LCD TV and free wireless internet, which is definitely a big plus. You can pick up log in and password information when you check in but do not expect fast internet as the service was very sporadic and tempermental. I was able to check emails okay but could not go too much beyond that. I could imagine how frustrated heavy web surfers can become. There are two elevators on premise, unfortunately as some of the reviews pointed out previously, they are EXTEMELY SLOW. A couple times I had to wait about 5 minutes to get into the lift so be prepared to have some patience if your room is at the higher floor. The other issue that could possibly distrub people is the noise level but this is probably due to the hallway is so narrow and the thin wall as well as small room space make the noise sound even worse. If someone slams the door (which happened a lot), then you definitely hear it. If you were a light sleeper, make sure to bring your ear-plugs. I brought mine and they were extemely helpful for sleeping at night.Overall, this is a pretty good no thrill hotel designed for budget conscious travelers. If you don't mind the bunker beds and shared bathrooms (which are very clean), this is absolutely a much better option than those youth hotels such as YMCA. But even for people who want an upgraded room, you only need to pay a little more to get your own private bath/shower facility. For a city like New York where hotel price is skyrocketed, Pod is a great alternative and provides exceptional value. This place definitely goes on my NYC hotel list of stay.",San Francisco,213,4.0

BUT>>> there were bed bugs in our room and I came home full of bites. We quarantined everything and washed all our clothes before they came into our apartment... What a hassle and it just added stress to our trip. Before we left we asked for garbage bags to bag up our luggage so that we wouldn't spread any bed bugs to our car. When we told the front desk clerk it was because there were bugs in our room he didn't seem alarmed at all. It's really too bad because I would go back here if it weren't for the bugs.",Toronto,21,2.0

Ultimately, we were disappointed by the service and amenities. A problem with our heater was not fixed for three hours, and we had to make three separate requests to have the issue resolved. The room itself was fine (although cramped, obviously), but the hotel seems to trade on being very hip and cool, with flashy ads in the foyer (although the much-touted cafe in the lobby was 'closed for winter' so there was no way to get a tea or coffee without leaving the hotel) but is lacking elsewhere. The TV seemed to have half of the channels blocked and the wireless internet was atrocious - slower than dial-up! Perhaps we were spoiled - we had stayed at the wonderful Herald Square Hotel (for a very similar rate) earlier in our trip and this was very disappointing as a follow-up. We're probably not the right sort of travellers for the Pod - young singles or college students who don't want to stay at a backpackers would no doubt love it (if it fits their budget), but for us, it was kind of irritating. More style than substance.","Sydney, Australia",9,3.0

It was a first time to NYC for both of us, and needed a good price as I was paying all of the expenses for the trip. I didn't feel we needed a place with large rooms, as we were pretty much only going to be using the hotel as place to sleep, shower, and store our luggage. I used TripAdvisor to learn more about the rooms and level of service and cleanliness, and decided it would be a good fit for our trip and that a Queen room would be the best for us, as I wasn't sure how my mother would handle the ""shared-bathroom idea"". Due to using TripAdvisor I knew exactly what to expect so we had a marvelous experience! We had no problems with our reservation. We didn't have much need to talk to the manager, concierge, or front desk staff during our stay, but the doormen were quite nice and we did interact with the women who made the bed and cleaned the room and they were very pleasant and helpful. Of course, it may have also helped that I left a good tip for the housekeeping staff every day! We were late risers, but I just made sure to get the attention of housekeeping on our floor as we were leaving for brunch every day and by the time we got back our room was always made up. Our room was small but clean and the bed was more than adequate for two women of 110 to 135 pounds each, and there were plenty of blankets and I liked the pillows too. The heating unit in the wall worked well for us when we needed it. We watched the television briefly at times during our 6-day stay; they had a fair variety of channels, but hopefully when you are visiting NYC you aren't spending much time watching the ""idiot box"". The bathroom was cute and modern, but very small (the shower was fairly roomy though). The door to the bathroom in the Queen rooms is definitely transparent glass, so I would recommend that you be VERY comfortable with whomever you are traveling with. I took the opportunity to look at the shared bathrooms and even used them a few times and they really were nice and clean and much larger than the private bathroom that we had. One night the hot water in our room shower wasn't working. I resolved to mention it to the manager the next day and had my mom use a shared bathroom shower that night which she liked just fine. (By the next morning the hot water problem had resolved itself.) We loved the decor both in the lounge and in our room and I was a big fan of the piped music in the hallways. Very hip! I didn't get to use the outdoor spaces of the hotel much as it was October and a little chilly but I looked at them and they seemed nice. The elevators were quite fast considering how big a building it was. No smoking allowed in the building, so my mother quickly adjusted to sitting on a stoop a little ways down the block from the hotel for her smoke breaks, and I would sit with her; it made us feel a bit like NYC natives! The concierge recommended a 24-hour diner (Morning Star Cafe) around the corner from the hotel and we ate there every day for brunch; I highly recommend the toasted croissants there. Morning Star serves good diner food if you like diner food. There was a drugstore down the block and a grocery store around the corner for any necessary sundries and snacks and the local subway train stations were only a few blocks away. The neighborhood seemed pretty safe by my standards (but I grew up in a sort-of-bad area in Chicago so that may affect my frame of reference) and was pretty to walk through. Unlike in some cities, the concierge doesn't call for a cab for you; the doorman helps you with that or you flag down a cab yourself on the street. I've stayed in much larger rooms in other towns for similar prices but NYC's an expensive town, so I think I got a good deal, and as I said before, what do you need a big room for anyway when you spend more time out of it than in it? I would stay there again, and both my mom and I thought we would be just as happy opting for the less expensive shared-bathroom option.","Chicago, IL",7,4.0

It looked great on their website. And it does have a good location being close to the centre of the city. However before booking a few things you need to consider:1. Room size. We had a double room with a bathroom facility (most rooms are shared bathroom facilities). It is the smallest room i have ever stayed in. Hostel rooms are larger. Given NYC is short on space i can understand this somewhat. However the double bed was not able to accomodate my girlfriend and i (we are not big people....both thin and used to sleeping in a small double bed)....by the second night we were doing the ""top and tail"" thing. The thing to keep in mind is that the room is very small wit hardly any room to put bags. My partner and i only had one travel pack each which we were able to squeeze in but anything more and you would struggle. 2. Noise. Ok so we were there at xmas and people are going to be a bit more festive than usual. This is to be expected. But two things that i don't expect are paper thin walls (a person 2 rooms along from us had a bad chest infection that had a cough with it...the coughing fit kept many on the floor awake) and a 2 finger gap under the door to the room which meant that much noise floated into the room. When i spoke to reception about the door problem they said they were awre of this and that most rooms had the problem (so the thought of changing rooms was quickly discouraged).3. Staff. I'm usually unconcerned about the staff in a hotel as i don't usually have much to do with them (preferring to spend my days and nights exploring the city i'm visiting). But these guys stood out. Not friendly or helpful and when our bags were broken into in our room (yip 22 years of traveling and this is a first for me.......especially given the bags had padlocks on them- which were cut and the room was locked at the time) the staff couldn't have cared less. The manager was called and he straight away went on the defensive telling us that this was the first time this had ever occurred in his 15 years at the hotel. Nothing was taken so i was only asking that no one (cleaner or otherwise) go into our room for the rest of the stay. He didn't like this at all. Never mind. It just meant we took all valuables with us each day. Out of interest we paid £135 a night.On the plus side this hotel is close to everything a first time tourist to nyc would need....supermarket around the corner, subway one avenue over, various food places in close vacinity, 10-15 min walk to rock and empire state building.","London, United Kingdom",31,1.0

Its cheaper than most NYC hotels, but you get a very small room. The rooms are clearly set up for couples - not families - there is a certain aura of sexual tension that comes from the room.

Check in itself was straight forward and we were in our rooms within a few minutes. The price was also very competitive for New York.As for the rooms themselves - I'd read reviews of this hotel on tripadvisor and was aware that he rooms were small - that was an understatement! Tiny, to say the least! Bunk beds (which I haven't slept in for about 30 years!) and not much storage space gave it a cramped feel, especially for two 6'2"" guys! However, the hotel gets away with this as they have attempted to make the most of the limited space - both beds had small tv monitors attached to the walls and there was a handbasin which was surrounded by mirrors (sort of like you find in a toilet on a plane). The decor was also modern. But the size of the room doesn't bother me when I'm in New York - the only time I spend in my room is when I'm sleeping, and as the beds were very comfy, the size thing doesn't matter.The one weird thing was the bathroom situation. As it's a shared bathroom hotel, I expected it to be smelly and dirty, but it couldn't have been further from the truth. Absolutely spotless every time I used one - I'm guessing they are cleaned throughout the day. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor, two either side of the elevators. The handy thing about them is that there is a panel above the door in your room with lights that turn red when they're occupied.Location wise the pod is superb. East 51st Street, between 2 & 3 ave it's a 5 minute walk to Fifth Avenue. There is also a tube stop just up the road. Next door to the hotel are two (pricey) restaurants and also a nice pub which has all day specials. Around the corner on 2nd Avenue is a cafe which does typical American breakfasts and is surrounded by loads of Irish pubs.Overall, a great hotel to base yourself for a short break in New York, however, I would have to check out the double rooms if I was to stay here with my partner. If you don't mind bunk beds and a small room it's ideal.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",129,4.0

Since I was just using the hotel as a place to sleep, I didn't mind it's small rooms. My problems began when I went back to the hotel to sleep so I had the energy for another long day of sightseeing. It was around midnight and the room was freezing. The heating unit seemed to be controllable, so I turned it on and it didn't work. I had to call down to the front desk twice to get an answer. They told me it would come on because it was centrally controlled. The noisy unit finally came on around 1 am. It would turn off every so often, so I got the pleasure of hearing through the hotel's thin walls. A couple in a nearby room decided to have very loud sex several times, and another person blowed dried their hair at 3 am. So, needless to say, I had difficulty sleeping. I guess you get what you pay for. I won't be staying at this hotel again, because this type of hip budget hotel attracts younger people who obviously do not know or care about how to behave in a public lodging space.

Upscale ... hip ... it's all there.My single room was about 12x8' ... I could just about stretch my arms out above my head and my toes and touch the side walls.But was that a big deal? Nope. The room had everything I really needed. A place to sit. Free Wi-Fi in the room. A flat screen TV. Mirror and sink for shaving. All good.The shared bathroom concept was fine as well. Only saw all four on our floor full at once around 7:30 a.m. Other than that, I generally used the same one as it was always available. And the shower was fantastic. Just as a safeguard, I took my Crocs in the shower. There's not someone coming in behind every bathroom customer and squeegeeing the shower floor and spraying it down with Lysol. I'm just sayin'.There was a little noise issue, but nothing major. My room was next to the stairs (315) and I could hear folks in the stairwell every now and then. I had a neighbor that felt a speakerphone conversation at 5:15 a.m. was appropriate and I could hear that, but it wasn't too bad.The mattress itself was not a luxury pillowtop, but it wasn't a disaster either. I woke up with a sore shoulder, but it was fine ... I slept solid.When I first got there, the roaming guy in the lobby carried my luggage to the room and opened the door, etc. He turned on the heat. I eventually turned it off. Apparently on the third floor, you get plenty of radiant heat from the lower floors, and the in-room heat was really too much.Location, location, location!

For some great eats literally a stumble away, try Tanaka Sushi, 2 doors down, and Ees-a-Bagel, around the corner. Also, try booking through the hotel website, as I found the prices there to be cheaper than on mass sites like expedia.","New York City, New York",3,5.0

As we already expected, the room was small. What we didn't expect was that the bathroom door (we had a private one) didn't even close fully! Not fun! And when you do slide the door across it reveals a window into the bathroom so the person in the room could see into the shower! I ended up using the shared bathrooms which were large and clean (and more private!). The hotel is in a good location and the cheapest we could find in the area. Its close to the subway and The Morning Star around the corner has excellent breakfasts.The beds were ok, not particularly comfortable and there is no sound proofing at all. I was awoken by voices in the hallway twice in one night, too tired the other nights to notice.We weren't bothered about staying in a luxury hotel, one because we couldn't afford it in New York and two because we were there to spend maximum time exploring. But this was a bit grim.I can't say the service was particularly good or bad. The room was always cleaned when we returned,so no problems with that.I wouldn't recommend this hotel and wouldn't want to stay there again unless I had to. Although it's not a bad hotel, it's over priced and I believe it's over-rated.

I got no rest at all at the Pod, and therefore, in my battle with cheap, hard, substandard mattresses to wrest any sleep at all, I wasn't able to catch up on paperwork either. Kind of defeated the purpose of checking into a hotel in the first place.I had stayed at this location several times when the Hotel was still the Pickwick Arms. Flawed as the Pickwick was, I always slept comfortably. It's clear that the Podsters spent all their money on cutesy, trendy decor, but one cannot sleep on decor. For that necessity, one needs a mattress wherein the springs actually work. The Pod beds are dead, lifeless. I prefer firm to soft, but this isn't firm, it's stuffed nothingness without an iota of give. After two hours of trying to sleep on this rock, I called the front desk. The young woman on duty spoke like a robot. She wasn't apologetic or empathetic in the least. She suggested switching rooms. I tried this. The bed in the other room was just as merciless on the back. The next morning, I stepped off the elevator and the first thing I saw was a group of extremely weary-looking travelers of all ages. What struck me is that all of them wore identical expressions -- expressions of utter exhaustion. They hadn't been able to sleep either. There we were, those strangers and me, united by the deep bags under our eyes. And also united, quite possibly, by our mutual desire to take a lighted match and BURN THE POD HOTEL TO CINDERS!!!!!!I complained to the front desk clerk, a young man much more amiable and human-acting than the witch in charge the night before. He said he'd see what he could do. I lounged on a sofa in the lobby (better than the beds) until a manager came over and explained that he could only take a measly $25 off the final bill. So, there you have it:$124 for a night of no sleep whatsoever. The Pod Hotel is horrible. Oh, yes, it's clean. And quiet, despite the obvious lack of any soundproofing. But do not stay at this place. It deserves to be driven out of business and all its hipster knickknacks put on the sidewalk with (low) price tags affixed. I would never go back to this godawful, pathetic excuse for a hotel, and I informed the manager of that straight to his face. And I still want ALL of my money back.",Denver,19,1.0

It is, as others have noted, very trendy and modern. The lobby has big murals on the walls and flat screens behind the front desk. Then there was the room.We booked the room with two bunk beds. While the room was well appointed with individual TV's and a sink & mirror (I call it a 1/4 bath) I am not exaggerating when I say that I've seen closets bigger than this room. It was probably 8x12 feet. The shared bathrooms (4 on each floor) very clean and nicely done with granite floors and walls. They even have lights in your room to advise you when a bathroom is occupied (much like the airlines).So, here's where it all went bad. We came ""home"" one evening to find that our door was not latched. The door spring didn't have enough spring in it to pull it closed, and the housekeeper neglected to close it herself. I called the front desk, asked for the manager and was told there was none on duty. Ok. So I told whoever was ""in charge"" about our security breach. She assured me that she would tell the manager the next day.Well, we came home from our adventures the next day and, yep, the door was again ajar. I immediately stormed down to the front desk and exchanged some words with the person in charge. She told me that she had indeed made a note of my complaint, and passed it along to management. I asked if I could have a different room, and she refused. I was more than a little irked.The next day the manager called me and apologized. He said he would send up the hotel engineer to look at the lock, which he did. we were never offered any kind of compensation or upgrade for what could have been a disastrous situation had anything been stolen. And it would have been easy since the elevators are right off the lobby with free access to all floors and no security or other mechanical measures to stop someone.The hotel does offer in room safes, but my most valuable asset, my laptop, would not fit in it.I had a 10 year career in hotel management, so I know that mistakes can happen. But to have the door left open 2 days in a row is negligent! And for there not to be a manager on duty tells me that they don't really care about their guests.","San Jose, California",52,2.0

The first impression is that the Pod is cool. Modern, stylish interior, situated at 51st & 3rd Ave, which is not ""wham"" in the city center, but good enough. The Pod boasts of its tiny rooms, so they should come as no surprise. Especially the bathrooms (I had a private bathroom, but you can share) are microscopic, but as long as you know what to expect, it kind of just adds to the cool-factor. More important is it that the rooms are very well kept, housekeeping is excellent, and all in all it's a good place to just sleep while doiscovering NY. The free in-room wifi-service is handy for the likes of me, although bandwidth is not great.Worst hotel experience: Upon checkout, the Pod had added 70$+ tax pr. night to the price we had agreed upon before booking (279 instead of 209). It took a phone call to the manager and some arguing to get the price right. Even so, the standard room prices are somewhat inflated compared to the room size - even for New York.Best hotel experience: Le Bateau Ivre, the French bistro next door.

Yes, the room was small in square footage, but we were only there to sleep anyways and the way it was all set up was very functional. The room had bunkbeds that were quite comfortable and large enough for two average sized adults to sleep comfortably in. The front desk staff were friendly and attentive. We called for extra pillows and we had then within 5 minutes. The room also had a sink, clothes hanging rack and a small desk. Our room was #723 and we weren't facing the street; it was quiet and other than doors opening in the hallway now and then we didn't hear anything. The room was quite warm so we kept the window open during the day and used the A/C at night. (New York climate control in buildings in general seems to run on the warm side.) The four shared bathrooms were directly across from our room (there's four per floor) and we never had to wait to use them. The staff clean the bathrooms at least twice a day and they were spotless, as was our room. Bathrooms 1 and 2 are a bit smaller than 3 and 4, FYI. Check them all out if you can & there's neat artwork in #3 and in all the hallways.The hotel has a rooftop patio with some chairs to sit and was a peaceful place to go and sit at night. The hotel decor is very hip and modern and they pipe music throughout, even in the shared bathrooms! The hotel seemed to be popular with travellers from Europe, which is great as they are a friendly bunch.They have a concierge service that seemed friendly and willing to help you find your way around the city. We didn't use them but there seemed to be a line of people in the mornings.They also have a storage room for your luggage if you're leaving/arriving early or late.My only small, very minor irk was we had to wait a long time for the elevators it seemed, especially during high traffic times in the morning. I suppose it can't be helped as there's only 2 elevators for a 14 floor hotel.All in all, we definitely enjoyed our stay and you can't beat the location. It's a short jaunt to the subway and there was a plethora of places to eat nearby. We particularly enjoyed the sushi place a few doors down (""Tanaka"") and the bagel/breakfast shops around the corner (""Ess-A-Bagel"" and ""Pax""). We didn't realize until the day we were leaving there is whole bunch more stuff just east of the hotel on 2nd. We felt completely safe in the neighbourhood, even at night.

If you want a nice spacious room, you're probably better off going somewhere else as well. Make no mistake, I thoroughly enjoyed the Pod hotel - because I knew exactly what I'd booked (thanks once again to the Tripadvisor community) and knew that that was exactly what I wanted from a hotel. I wanted somewhere to sleep that was clean ,conveniently located and above all a good price - NYC is the attraction here, not a hotel room.The rooms are SMALL; they are basic and functional in an IKEA sort of way. The toilets are taken from your average economy class airliner. The bunk pods are tiny but the boys loved the ipod dock and TV's. Their small room quickly turned into a bombsite but the maids were brilliant and just kept on clearing it up. Our queen double was much more comfy but you could still watch tv while sitting on the WC! Everything was really clean and new/recently refurbished. Bedlinen/ towels were clean, new and crisp.The concierge service was excellent and very helpful. The post-checkout luggage deposit was very easy and Raphael was able to sort out a pristine car to Newark for us very reasonably. The only downside, as others have mentioned, were those silly litle lifts. We worried a little before getting there about the shared bathrooms, - without need - they were always spotless and we found that the 'light' system worked really well . The subway @ 53E & Lexington is only a couple of minutes away and Times Square is a brisk 20-minute walk. Lots of good eateries around and that little park over the road next to the synagogue is a gem. They will send you to the 'Morning Star Cafe' for breakfast - go there, its good. On the subject of delis, when near Central Park /5th Ave shopping make a point of lunching at VIAND coffee shop @ 61st & Madison - great food and crazy deli atmosphere - a true NYC experience!The hotel was until recently called 'The Pickwick Arms' and some taxis, Carmel cabs included,still recognise it by this name.As long as The Pod is what your looking for, it's an absoute gem, and I'd have absloutely no hesitation in returning","Llanelli, United Kingdom",159,4.0

I went with my brother and sister. We got the townhouse room with a queen bed and a single + trundle. We arrived at the Pod before check-in time. The staff was quick to store our bags for us so we could run out and explore NYC. They said our room would be ready by 2pm. We returned just after 2pm to our room still not made up. They gave us keys anyway and said we could go to the room and freshen up/change/whatever and after we left for our afternoon activities, they would get the room squared away. We got to the room and it was spacious (according to NYC hotel standards). However, there were many many tiny red ants marching along the back of the headboard of the queen bed and on the nightstand next to the bed. And even on the desk area across the room. We were horrified and immediately notified the front desk. They promptly sent someone up to our room and the man who came up was surprised and horrified, as well. They had us gather our luggage and they moved it to our new room - directly beneath the first one we were placed in.While I was relieved that they were horrified, it is surprising that the previous people in the room didn't make management aware of the problem - or the staff in charge of cleaning wouldn't have noticed this problem.When we got back to our (new) hotel room very late in the evening, we found some baby red ants in the bathroom. We would kill them and more would appear soon after. It was not crawling with ants - but they were there, and it made me a bit squeamish nonetheless. I inspected the room all over, but in our second room I found them only in the bathroom. We told the front desk person at 3:30 a.m. on our second night (because we had been out and about all day/night long) but there were no open rooms to move to, and we really didn't spend much time in the room. However, for nearly $400 a night, I expect pristine rooms with no pests.I loved the Pod Hotel for its customer service and that they immediately addressed our concern with the first room. I also like the location of the Pod. The room was set up nicely and spacious for three to four people. Close to the subway and close to Rockerfeller Plaza and Times Square and 5th Ave shopping, etc.The hotel gave us a small amount off our bill, but not as much as it should have been, in my opinion. For that kind of inconvenience (not to mention that it is gross), we should have been given a bit more off the tab.Upon checkout, we were told that there was indeed a pest problem with the first room and they were going to have it fixed as soon as possible.

I booked my trip using the hotel website and from reading reviews on Tripadvisor I knew exactly what to expect.The old adage ""you get what you pay for"" couldn't be more true. The rooms, while quite small, were adequate (barely) for sleeping. Since I was travelling alone I chose the ""single room without bath"" option and that's what I got, a small bed, flat screen TV, closet safe and sink/mirror with the toilet and shower (there are 4 per floor) down the hall. I expected all that I got, what I wasn't expecting was a very small bed (suitable for someone under 5'6"") and a noisy room - I was able to easily hear people walking and talking in the hall, the opening and closing of doors and people using hair dryers in the morning. The best thing about the hotel, other than its' price in a very pricy city, was the location on 51st street between 2nd and 3rd Avenues near St. Patricks Cathedral and Rockefeller Center. The area, in midtown Manhattan, was safe and had plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance.If visiting midtown I'd recommend this hotel if you're looking for a place to sleep and save money. There are really no other hotel features but that's ok if you accept the tradeoff. If you're looking for a spa, doorman, weight room, parking, etc. look elsewhere.My suggestion, if arriving on a flight into JFK, is to take the Airtrain to the Jamaica station ($5.00 when exiting) and then take the E subway ($2.00) westbound getting off at Lexington and 53rd and walking 2 blocks to the hotel. Instead of taking a very expensive taxi or shuttle from the airport you can take this combination for only $7.00 and arrive at the hotel in less than 60 minutes with more money in your pocket to spend on souvenirs around Times Square.","Scottsdale, Arizona",2219,3.0

The room smelled, and the staff was inexperienced and not helpful. We had a room with a bathroom. The bathroom smelled strongly of mildew, which got worse as the week went on. And for such a small room, it meant that the entire room smelled. We asked them to fix the problem, but I think they just came and sprayed something. In hindsight, we should have asked to move to another room.You could buy breakfast in a very pleasant outdoor sitting area. But it was a bit expensive, and the waitstaff could have benefitted from Table Service 101. We only approached other hotel staff three times during our stay. Although inexperienced, the staff was generally pleasant. However, on the day of checkout, we were waiting for a long time for the bellhop to return to schedule a ride to the airport. A man came over, who I assume was the manager, and instead of helping us to schedule a ride, ridiculed us for the amount of time we had set aside to get to the airport, and then, in the same conversation, scolded us (sarcastically? we're not sure) for not planning enough time to get to the airport. All the while, he could have been reserving a car for us.

I stayed there when it was the Pickwick Arms back in 2001 and I'm REALLY impressed with what they've done to the place since.You do want to be familiar with your roommate, however, as there is little privacy in the room. They are small but extremely efficient. One thing I would suggest they do is put up a few more shelves and wall mounted hooks for guests to put their things on. Space usage is at a premium in these rooms as they are very small so that would really go along way for convenience if someone is staying there more than a few days as I did. Everything was spotless and I felt very comfortable in the room. I loved the wireless Internet and had no trouble using it as some others have reported on this site. I particularly loved the iPod docking station so I could not only play my music but charge my iPod. That was a huge asset for me as I love to have my tunes with me.As I said earlier, there isn't much privacy for the bathroom or shower if you book a room with it's own bathroom. The sliding door that you close the bathroom with leaves a clear glass window open so those outside the bathroom can see in (see picture - it is of the shower and toilet). So if you are with a co-worker or someone you're not intimate with, it's tough to have your shower without baring your bits to them. It would be practical to have that frosted but it is not so plan accordingly. There are public/shared showers just down the hall, however, if you need privacy and they are very clean, though I didn't use them.I loved the Pod and it's location. There is a lovely little waterfall sitting area just across the street for your morning coffee if you like and there are no shortages of great little eateries all over the area. I took an entire day and walked all over Manhattan and never once worried about getting lost. It is a very easy city to navigate and the hotel is very easy to find. The restaurant/wine bar next door is nice but there are much cheaper places to eat and drink in the area, if you are so inclined. I found it to be simply overpriced for what you get.The Pod is a lovely little spot and I highly recommend it.

We asked where their computer/printer was located so we could get a print out of our boarding passes for the next morning. This hotel, which is advertised as modern did NOT have a computer/printer or an internet connection for hotel guests to use. In addition, they rudely informed us that they were ""unable"" to print our boarding passes because ""they were having problem running their own reports."" Even in the cheapest and most dumpy hotels while traveling in Europe, we always had an internet connection or computer of some sort... this was a HUGE disappointment!In the meantime, our room only had two pillows so I called the front desk and asked for two additional pillows. The front desk person said they did but not enough staff (the three people behind the counter standing around weren't enough?) to walk them up to the room. As I was already changed into pj's and it was quite late so I didn't go down 8 floors to get the pillows. Finally, they had a small flatscreen television in the room but it didn't have a swivel function so it was nearly impossible to view it from the bed. Also, the cable channels didn't match the cable guide...

The location is terrific - a few blocks to trains and restaurants and other conveniences right outside the front door. Despite the hotel's website, the guests' ages ranged beyond 20's (which was nice!) and we felt very welcome. The lobby and the small outdoor deck and patio are fun and hip and while we didn't eat at the hotel, we enjoyed a cocktail on the deck one evening prior to heading out for dinner.

I read many positive reviews of The Pod Hotel and decided this was the best choice for two people coming w/o children.I am very pleased with my choice! YouThe Pod is on 51st street on a very nice block. When first going into The Pod Hotel, you are greeted by very nice people at the desk. The walls are painted a cool art deco design, and the lobby is very stylish. There is also an outside deck and dining area that is very well kept up.After making my way to my room, I noticed the small rooms, but didn't find them scary or claustrophobic. My friend and I shared a bunkbed. The beds have very stylish blankets. Each bed has a LCD tv that can pull out of the wall to position how you would like it. We also had a counter to put items on as well as a stainless steel sink to wash up at. The sink has two brand new bars of soap as well as two drinking glasses and towels/tp/hairdryer, etc below. Other rooms can vary in size, but this was my room.There are two bathrooms per floor. I was unsure if this would be a positive thing or not. I was imagining a 10 stall bathroom and locker room showers, but instead there are two separate bathrooms (called WC for water closet). They are very clean. Once you go in the bathroom, there is a turn lock that turns the room from ""vacant"" to ""occupied"" not only on the outside of the bathroom, but in other hotel rooms as well, so they can see the bathroom is occupied! Cool! Above hotel guest room doors inside there is a small area that shows ""1"" and ""2"". If there is someone in the bathroom, a red light will come on under the correct bathroom number. The shower was fun too! They have installed rainwater showerheads that gently filter water out. Each shower has a shampoo dispenser and a shower gel dispenser as well. There are also spotlights in the bathroom, making for a fun, moodlighting effect!When my friend and I ventured out for our fun, the maids came in and cleaned the rooms, making the beds and vaccumming/changing towels, etc. I was never in the room when they came to call, but I assume they have ""do not disturb"" tags downstairs. I loved the warm dance music piped in to the hallways/bathrooms as well. Brazillian music/salsa/samba music calmed and soothed you after a hectic day. It was very soft and non-intrusive. Check out the Pod Hotel website for a music sampler! Another cool thing inside the actual room were the nice extras that the Pod has put together-namely the ""Pod Survival Guide"" which is a pages long document that recommends restaurants for every taste, as well as finding the nearest hospital, post office and other things you may (unexpectedly) need. VERY HELPFUL!Checkout time was 12PM. My friend and I were not ready to leave yet. The hotel offers to hold your luggage until you leave. The bellman was as nice as can be...be sure to tip him! Also, there was a man at a small kiosk inside the hotel, selling Airlink Bus Shuttles back to the LaGuardia Airport. My friend and I were grateful for this convenient service back to LGA. The price was $18 back to LGA., but it was well worth it for the ease of knowing we had a scheduled ride back to the airport.All in all, I was VERY pleased with my stay at The Pod Hotel. It was always quiet inside (despite many other people staying here!) and the staff was very very friendly. The price was right for the neighborhood and the hotel was very stylish! A+!",CO,1,5.0

Booked a double room with en suite bathroom at The Pod after much research on Tripadvisor and we were definitely not disappointed.

The room was very clean, with lots of little hidey spaces to keep stuff and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was tiny, but the water was hot (a great relief in winter!) and more importantly (for me, a TV addict), I could still watch the news whilst washing my face and putting on my make-up! I have always been apprehensive about shared bathrooms, and like many other reviewers on this site, checked out the shared bathrooms during my stay and they were ALWAYS clean (the tiles were gleaming!) and usually one or two were available. I was very impressed. If I was not so finicky about sharing bathrooms, I will opt for this in a New York minute! The location was great. Very close to the subway, with lots of food options nearby. We ordered takeaway once from the menus placed in the room and had no problems - it came quickly and was still piping hot. Most importantly for me, The Pod is within walking distance from the shopping areas. I could walk to Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Sephora, the list goes on.

The Pod Hotel turned out to be a great choice.First, the price at a little under $200/night for the room was a great deal for NYC.Yes, the room is small, yes we had a shared bath, but the quality of the location, the hotel, the roof garden, the park next door, and the hotel staff more than made up for the room size and shared bath.THE SHARED BATH: As for the bath, it was always clean (it might be slightly wet from the previous shower user) and the tiles were made of a material that made you feel comfortable you wouldn't get athlete's foot from someone else. Access to the showers was never a problem.SUBWAY ACCESS: You are two blocks from two different stops, so you can access anything in Manhattan, Queens, etc very quickly. You can be at the Central Park or Metropolitan Museum stop in 5 minutes.ROOF GARDEN and PARK NEXT DOOR: My son ended up outside on the roof every evening for just a few minutes. He enjoyed the city view. I would slip out to the Park next door (actually it is across the street) every morning and eat a bagel and drink a coffee to the sound of the water fall. Go down to ""Ess a Bagel"" and get an awesome bagel, buy a coffee at the park, and just relax...STAFF: Always very nice and helpful. When the finished cleaning the room every day, as small as the room was, it was comfortable.NOISE: Amazingly, I heard very little. I have heard much more in places like the Marriott when people are coming in a 2PM. This is not to say you won't hear any but it was better than most hotels I have stayed at. If I heard morning noises I would simply pop in my ear plugs. LOCATION: If you are up to it, you can walk to Central Park or the Theater District, although some may find it too far. We did walk a good bit and didn't have a problem with the distances, although the subway is only two blocks away.STREET FRONT: The street frontage at the hotel had several restaurants with outdoor dining so there was a very nice energy on the street.IF YOU LIKE STAYING AT YOUR HOTEL: This probably isn't the place for you. The rooms are small. However, if you want a comfortable place to relax for an hour in the morning or at the end of the day, and you want a great location on a budget, this is a good bet.Enjoy the City!","Washington DC, District of Columbia",56,5.0

Last time I was in a double room with private bath, and this time I was in a bunk bed room with shared bath (I was traveling with a friend). Check in was pretty quick and easy. When we got to our room, we were horrified to discover a cockroach on the floor. However, that was the first and last ""creepy crawly"" we saw during our time here (trust me--I even checked the mattress for bed bugs). Overall our room was kept quite clean. Sheets were changed daily and we always had plenty of clean towels. As for sharing bathrooms, we never found it to be a problem. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor, one of which was huge, three of which were average, with just a toilet and small shower. There was always a bathroom available whenever I needed it. The indicator lights in our room were also handy, as they showed us which bathrooms were free at any given time. In regards to cleanliness of the bathrooms, the cleaning staff did their best. The only issue I had with the cleanliness was not due to negligence by the hotel, but rather by inconsiderate guests who did not take 2 seconds out of their lives to clean up after themselves. That being said, the washrooms were always relatively clean. I would, however, suggest you bring a pair of flip flops for the shower if you are a bit creeped out by germs like I am. The location is great (like a block and a half to the Subway, close to restaurants, cute little park across the street). If you are looking for a luxurious, spacious place to be pampered, this is NOT it.

The hallways may be a tad too dimly lit, which may offend some. The fact that the building has only two elevators can cause some longer than normal waits.

There is a sink, towels and hairdryer provided in the room, as well as a nice small flatscreen TV on the wall that you can watch in bed. As it mention on the Pod website, there are light indicators above the door to let you know when the shared bathrooms are free which was very handy. There are 4 bathrooms on the floor - each containing a toilet, sink and shower. I never encountered any problems with access to the bathrooms, maybe everyone just needed to use them at different times! The facilities were clean and easy to use - I really can't complain about them! You also get a spare toilet roll in your room in case the one in the shared bathroom has run out.I also stayed for 1 night in a twin room with ensuite bathroom. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was also top notch, it was quite small compared to the size of the room, but it had all the important stuff like a toilet and a shower in there!I stayed at The Pod when it was previously called The Pickwick Arms and it has improved so much since it has been renovated. The whole decor of the reception and rooms is much more appealing and the shared bathroom facilities are of excellent quality now.Also, air con was provided in both rooms which was a welcome bonus as the weather was scorching whilst I was there!The location is brilliant - it is only a few blocks' walk from Times Square/Rockefeller Center, and considering the price, it is a really good deal for NYC. I paid the internet rate of $149 for single room/shared facs and then $219 for the twin room. Obviously they whack on the tax to this basic price, but it is still very good.I also ate at The Pod cafe for breakfast which was a pleasant experience. The food was nice and also there are seats in the foyer, or outside in the garden, either of which I found to be comfortable places to sit and eat.Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a budget hotel in a great location.","Bexley, England",8,5.0

The price was $159 per night, both through the hotel website and Expedia. For this, I got a single bed in a very tiny room, with a sink (the kind you see in airplane bathrooms). The toilet and shower were down the hall - 2 for the entire floor. Although previous reviews suggested the bathrooms were kept immaculate, I cannot agree. There was perpetually a very large puddle of water on the floor in both and other occupants often left items in the very small rooms. Although the hotel was booked solid, it was rare I actually had to wait for the bathroom, but in the morning it was a problem. A far bigger problem was that, in a 14 story hotel, there was only one working elevator and the waits could be considerable, particularly for those of use on the highest floors. On the plus side, they offer reasonable (for New York) priced items for breakfast and, given the location, there were plenty of alternatives for eating. There is a roof deck that was very popular and a restaurant attached. Free wifi worked well. Decent selection of channels on the flat screen. Check in and out was relatively painless and there is a ground transport agent during the day in the hotel to help with flight connections. I am likely at the age where I no longer wish to share bathrooms with strangers, so perhaps this was not the best hotel for me. The other guests were noticably younger. The location is superb and the price (for New York) was low, although it does not seem unreasonable to have even a small private bathroom for $160 per night.

Incidently, my old review was not great. But i heard it had been refurbished, plus the price was a bargain so i gave it another shot.I wasn't disappointed. The hotel has been transformed into a clean, funky, youthful looking place. The lobby is attractively lit, with lots of seating and space. Check in was the quickest i've ever experienced. Staff were very friendly.I had a double pod which wasn't a bunk but a double bed. I'm a solo traveller so i was happy with the 'extra' space. The room is tiny and i struggle to comprehend how 2 people could comfortably stay in the double room but hey, if you're not fussy then you should be fine.The room was very well organised. Storage in nooks and under the bed. A small desk and chair beside the bed. The sink area had small shelves hidden from view and shelves beneath it with lots of towels and a hairdryer. They even gave shampoo, soap and body lotion. The safe was very small, hidden in the wall but i was thankful for it. There was a small shower and toilet space behind a frosted glass sliding door, which didn't close so privacy may be an issue for people sharing who aren't couples! It was a massive rainwater shower which was fantastic. There was an air con unit but this was so noisy i didn't have it on during the night which proved difficult in such hot weather. It definately needs replacing. One of the great things was the ipod dock. I was able to charge my ipod and set an alarm (i forgot both my charger & clock so it was a great help!).If you get a single or bunked room you shared the four bathrooms on each floor. On my day of checkout, i didn't fly until the evening and was able to have a shower in one of the shared bathrooms. They are always available. Very clean and actually bigger than the bathroom i had in my room! The downside to The Pod Hotel was that the rooms are awfully close to one another and i could hear hairdryers, people talking, doors opening and closing and loud TVs, which was annoying when i just wanted to get some sleep at night! Also the maids are just so difficult. Even though i put a 'do not disturb' sign on my door (as i knew they started very early) they still knocked! Every bloody day! Plus the hoovering and chatting from them seemed to go on for hours. I swear they hoovered the floor outside my room five times in an hour! Another downside was the lifts. Oh my goodness, they were the slowest lifts ever! There are 2 but i often waited five minutes before giving up and using the stairs. Good workout i suppose!Location wise, hotel is east 51st between 2nd & 3rd avenues. If you walk a block towards 4th you'll reach the subway to uptown and a further block is the subway downtown. It's on the 6 which is great for going to Brooklyn Bridge downtown plus the Met and Bloomingdales uptown. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk to Times Square, if that!There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel and a supermarket on 2nd ave at the corner of 51st. Another thing is they serve breakfast in the hotel lobby from 6am. Nothing special but it beats walking on an empty stomach!Overall, i am so pleased i went back to The Pod Hotel. Fantastic little, well organised, bargain rooms in a quiet area. As somewhere to just rest your head, its almost luxury!","London, England",122,4.0

We stayed in a bunk bed room for less than $200/night. -Shared restroom wasn't an issue, I never even checked the light above the door, because in 4 days I didn't have to wait once.-The room was tiny, but that's not why you're in NYC, right? It was perfect for what it was- a clean, cold, place to sleep. -Did I mention clean? I was pleasantly surprised by the level of cleanliness. Very good in that respect.-Other raves: rooftop garden, nice doormen, and helpful (& hot) concierges. -We also arrived early without notice, and were allowed to check in, so that was cool.-Other guests seemed to be friendly and respectful.-Negatives- -the maids were a bit noisy when making their rounds at 9:30am, but I guess some people might already be getting ready for lunch at that hour. Not me. Still sleeping. -The restrooms didn't have fans... odd. which made for a bit o'steam in peak shower times, but it was certainly manageable.","Portland, OR",0,5.0

BUT, if you are looking for an affordable- clean, comfortable room that is designed to maximize use of space in East Midtown Manhattan then DO consider ThePod.Most reviews cover the basics: great location in Midtown Manhattan 51st East of Lexington; close to MOMA, the Lexington subway, short distance from Times Square and Central Park. Lobby is minimalist/modern. Outdoor-indoor cafe/restaurant. 14th floor observation terrace, and neighborhood outdoor cafes/restaurants just down the street off of 2nd Avenue.We enjoyed a room with full size bed with in room bathroom- Could have opted for the ""shared"" bathroom accomodations at a cheaper price..but we decided to ""splurge"". The bed was firm..and the in room air conditioner worked very well. Bathroom was situated in a small closet like room with sliding door. Compact arrangement of shower stall/commode/sink/ mirror. I loved the sink; stainless steel with a clever flip-cap drain. Towels were basic variety white (not too large) and extra toiletries included: soap, shampoo, lotion..and a hairdryer. Free Wifi---no inroom coffee service (but coffee available for purchase via lobby cafe) I checked out the ""community bathroom"" on our floor..and would have been comfortable with the arrangements if needed.

This time myself and a friend stayed for 2weeks. The Reception: The Hotel lobby is funky and the staff are helpful. Chillout lounge music played throughout the Hotel speakers including in the shared bathrooms.There's a smaller desk near the entrance door where Marco seems to organise everything including the shuttle bus to the airports. Book in advance with him as the shuttle bus has scheduled times. This is only $20 each person to JFK which is more than half price if going by taxi.The room:We had a bunk bed room which is small, compact but did the job. The room contained a bunk bed, sink area, towels, hair dryer, TV's (one to each bunk), a desk+chair and a safe.We had to share the bathrooms which are located along the corridors but there's a light indicator above our room door which showed us which ones were occupied. The bathrooms were clean and always had hot water.The air conditioning unit is below the window. We were there during the heatwave so we had to sleep with this on and put up with the noise of it but its not too bad.The roof garden:Go up to the 14th floor in the elevator, take a right down the corridor and there's a door to the stairwell on your left. Go up this to the fantastic roof garden with its fake grass and bed loungers. The last time i stayed here the roof garden was closed at 9pm but since they put up proper railings they seem to have the roof open all the time now.The Cafe:The Cafe is an area out the back off the main reception. Its very neat and trendy garden area with decking and lots of bamboo planting. There is no smoking out there so you will need to stand outside the front entrance to smoke. Its not too bad cause you end up chatting to all sorts of visitors also out smoking.The Location:The Hotel location is fantastic. Situated in a fairly residential area of Midtown East between 2nd & 3rd Avenues. To get to the Subway take a left outside the front door, walk straight to the end of the next block and you're at the subway for the Uptown 6 train. The Downtown 6 is just across the street.There are plenty of bars and eateries around this area. For a real New York style breakfast go to the Morning Star Cafe on 2nd Ave. (take right outside Hotel and right again at the corner)Beside that there's an Irish Pub called the Pig and Whistle. This opens until 4am!For Laundry there's a Laundry service across from the Pig and Whistle. There's a big one on the corner but we used the small one beside the other corner where the flower shop is. Bring your bag of laundry in and they price it by the weight. It cost about $9 for a weeks load of washing. Drop it off and pick it up later in the day. They open until 7pm and your washing is returned washed, dried, folded and vacuum packed!We didn't get them ironed but i borrowed an iron and ironing board from the guys at the front desk of the Hotel.Overall this is a fantastic Hotel that is reasonably priced and has everything you need for a visitor.","Dublin, Ireland",11,5.0

It couldnt be easier to get to.Take the Air Train from JFK (free the day that I travelled) then the E line subway to Lexington 53rd which is$2. Come out of the subway and the hotel is less than a 5 min walk/2 blocks away. Better than $50 in a cab.The hotel check in was quick and the staff were really friendly, just what you want after a 7 hour flight. The rooms are exactly as described...immaculately clean and serve a purpose. Some people say they are too small but who goes to NY to stay in the hotel?Free wifi for your laptop and a docking station for your ipod in every room and the single room that I had also had a wash basin and all the toiletries and towels. The little lights that let you know if the bathroom is empty are ideal asalthough there are only 2 per floor I never had to wait and they were always clean and tidy. The shower is excellent as it has mid level jets as well as the overhead shower.Come out of the front door of the hotel and turn right and 20 meters away at the intersection is a road with plenty of lively bars and restaurants and although travelling alone and my 1st time in NYC I had no problem at all. This is a very nice neighbourhood. Come out of the hotel and turn left onto Lexington and you are immediately hit with the sort of views that you associate with NYC....huge skyscrapers !Its within a 15 - 20 mninute walk to places like 5th Avenue, Times Square etc ( although maybe it just seemed that short as there is so much to take in ! )But the mind blowing thing the 1st time you see it is to go on the roof terrace at night. I walked out onto the terrace about 2am and it was still really warm and the view just was amazing. A nice place to sit in the cool morning as well with a coffee from the Starbucks just round the corner ( out of the hotel turn right then turn right).Checkout the staff were really helpful and I needed to get to Newark airport to collect my hire car. They run a shuttle for $20 per person which runs every hour but you need to book this.

However the place I did stay in at first was so bad I had to leave. I spent a frantic morning rushing around trying to find somewhere, eventually heading to the Pod. I explained my situation and asked if they had any rooms free. The man on the desk kept getting distracted by the phone, so another man, I presume the manager, came over to check on me. He found my reservation and said my room was free now if I wanted it. They blocked it off while I went back for my bags and checked me in fine, earlier than normal but with no hassle.I was in a single room with shared bathroom, the room was small but modern and very clean. With a small hangar area, a stainless steel sink, tissues and towels, a flatscreen tv, and desk with alarm clock with an ipod dock in it. This was VERY helpful for charging up my ipod before travelling home! Esp as my ipod crashed during my stay but I could run it down and recharge it and it worked again!There was little noise from other guests, when you could hear someones TV walking the coridoors you couldnt hear that in your room. The worst was some young teenagers who were in and out of each others rooms and whispering but loudly in the coriddors. But this wasnt a big deal, and most hotels will have noise in them!The shared bathrooms were toilet, sink and shower, again modern, clean and absolutely fine. They play music in them from reception which was a nice touch, and the showers have shower gel and shampoo if you dont have your own.The staff were so helpful in getting me in when I was upset, the rooms cleaned to a very high standard, the location was great only one avenue from 51st St Subway which was a quick interchange (or walk) to Grand Central and connections there.

The shower heads were the big ones that come down like rain above you and you could adjust to your desired temperature! Our only complaint was that one of the showers had a clogged drain, so that particular shower filled up and overflowed into the rest of the small bathroom. I read other reviews before booking this hotel and found that some people stated there were no sheets provided. THAT IS NOT TRUE! Each bed is covered with a red or blue ""cover"" and you have to peel back that cover to reveal the sheets and blanket.

I started to look for hotels near Times Square and came across the Hotel Carter (the lowest rated hotel on the entire planet) for $139 and also showed the Pod Hotel. On all of the travel sites, they showed the hotel booked (I was looking 4 days prior to travel...this was a last-minute trip). I never gave-up. I called the hotel and they showed full. I called back later. A VACANCY!$139 for a single (shared bath), YAY!I took the LIRR into Penn Station ($20 RT) and bought a single subway ticket on the 6 train to 51st Street and walked one-block east to the hotel.It took 45 seconds to check-in. The clerk was smiling and very courteous (he looked a little like Stanley Tucci).I was given room 1410 on the SE corner of the floor and immediately began looking around my room. It was perfect for my needs. I am 6'1"" and the bed had ample room for me. I'm also 250 lbs/ 22 kilo / just over 20 stone and the bed was STILL roomy! I checked out the hangers (stainless steel and not plastic or wood) and washbasin. Perfect. I have been on plenty of cruises and this was a little bigger than a single stateroom. I was not planning on stayin IN the hotel so I was giddy with joyI didn't bring my laptop but called to the desk to get my wifi acces code and hooked up my HP IPAQ pocket PC to look for things to do in the area. I found out that the best restaurant in the area was Le Bateau Ivre (ask for Louis..amd the bartender that looks a little like Phil Collins...they are great!!!!...located downstairs at the hotel!I had a wonderful dinner there and took my left-over bottle of Côtes du Rhône to the rooftop and met severel fellow travelers there while looking out over the peaceful cityscape of Turtle Bay. You can see a great view of the unique 100 UN Plaza condo and the Citicorp building behind you. There was a beautiful silence there and plenty of comfy places to sit. Just remember that the rooftop access isn't posted. Just go to the 14th floor and take the stairs (B) to the roof.As I was coming down the elevator, I could hear some singing (poor, dunken, singing) and the elevator car stopped on the sixth floor where the singing was coming from. As I reached the lobby, I informed the desk clerk and he grabbed the security guard without even hesitating and RAN to the elevator to take care of the problem. I was extremely imopressed by the speed at which they took care of the problem. I walked one block west to Azure a 24-hour gourmet market for a bottle of Pellegrino and returned to my room.The next morning, after a great sleep, I went to the lobby cafê for French press coffee, smoked salmon, with dill creme fraiche and baguette and OJ. The outdoor setting was beautiful and tranquil (check out the Green Acre Park across the street to the west).I gushed to the staff how wonderful my stay was and will plan on spending my next visit to NY with them.PS.

Not so much by the hotel, as I was by other trip advisor members whose reviews were right on the money! This is a great site and I really rely on it a lot.Needless to say, pretty much everything you read below is right on the money. I'll make a few key points though.....The hotel overall had a very young and euro feel to it. Definetly uber-hip. The lobby is very cool and you are impressed when you walk in. I was nervous because I didn't know once I got upstairs if it was going to be more like a hostel than a hotel.The guest rooms (I had a single one-person room) are definetly SMALL. No doubt. But it's clean and modern. It really worked for me. Although it's ""budget"" you quickly forget that when you are there. There are ""extras"" that make it seem more luxury - plasma tv, hair dryer, cool toilitries, free in-room safe, in-room stainless steel sink, modern ""Bertia"" chair........Now I did hot have a private bathroom. There were four bathrooms on my floor. You get an indicator light in your room when they are full. However, I never did have to wait. The bathrooms are VERY VERY nice......modern tile, rainhead shower. I found it to be very clean. I would forget that I was in a shared facility. it was just fine.There was always a concierge downstairs who was very friendly and very helpful. I didn't get the idea he was trying to sell anything. There is a great patio area outside which would be great to hang out in if you had a group.A couple negatives: Slow elevators. Security seemed a little lax - in the evenings the front door is not secured. This place is not for you if you need a lot of room or if you plan on spending a lot of time in the room.

I absolutely love the place! Firstly, it is so conveniently situated in the midtown area and only a couple of minutes walk from the subway. Secondly, it has been beautifully renovated and recreated as The Pod. My room was small but I expected that. Initally I shared a corridor bathroom, for the first three nights of my six night stay, then I upgraded to a single pod with a private bath. The corridor bathrooms were fine, I just found I'd gotten a little too old and set in my ways to share, especially for that middle-of-the-night 'loo run. The staff at the reception desk were unfailingly polite and helpful and Rafael, who books airport transfers among many other tasks, was especially pleasant and friendly. The room maids were quick and did a good job each time and were also very nice. Near the hotel you'll find any number of restaurants, cafes and other places where you can eat in or takeaway. I went to Pax each morning (turn left out of the hotel and walk to the corner, it's right there) for a great, inexpensive breakfast made by lightening-quick staff. There's also no shortage of supermarkets/pharmacies, atms and so forth in the area. Turn right out of the hotel and walk a block and a half to find the laundry where you can leave your dirty clothes and they'll be washed, dried, folded and waiting for you later in the day - you pay for this by the pound (in weight not sterling currency).I was on the 14th floor of the hotel overlooking the street and had a great view and no street noise. There was the usual corridor noise of closing doors but, as most of the rooms on my floor were occupied by single travellers, there was no noise from pairs and triples returning to their rooms and yacking all the way.I'm already planning another stay at The Pod in September next year and will never stay anywhere else in NYC if I can get a room there.","Sydney, Australia",32,5.0

The room was like a submarine cabin - extremely efficiently laid out, neat, clean, very modern, yet friendly. The room was perfect for one person - I do not believe having another one there would be possible. The shower was a surprise, though, really large, especially in contrast to all the other spots in the room where space was economised... The whole room design was very pleasing. My room was on the 3rd floor, facing courtyard, so in the morning I had to lean out of the bathroom window to see a scrap of the sky - to figure out whether it was sunny or cloudy. Location was also great - I went out alone in the evening and it is close to the subway, and in a very busy neighbourhood, so very safe. Lots of shops nearby open until late for a midnight snack. Lounge was fabulous. Wireless internet worked like a charm.  Now, a few cons. The a/c unit, though covered by new wooden slats, was very old, and extremely noisy, and I had to switch it off for the night. The elevators (there are only 2) are ancient, and slow - it would be nice if the guests staying on the lower floors had an easier access to stairs. Perhaps it was the location of my room, but I kept hearing banging doors to the common bathrooms a lot during the night. Finally, while perhaps it is a budget hotel if you choose the shared bathroom accommodation, I did not find it a budget at all for the other rooms. For as much - or less - I could have stayed in a hotel less hip, but with a coffeemaker and a fridge (thus saving some money on meals), and perhaps more space, had I come with a partner or kids.","Guelph, Canada",42,4.0

The room was small but as expected with new flat screen tv, complimentary wifi (I now only stay at hotels with free wifi - there's no excuse for not having this important facility), ipod docking station and safe. The room felt very clean and new. Given the hotel's status as a 1* job, I was really surprised at what I actually got. For a budget place, I really felt at home. The hotel positions itself as a groovy place where you can hang out, either reading or as many people were doing, surfing the web on their laptops. I took breakfast each day in the hotels outdoor cafe - a coffee and bagel with jam came to just under 5 USD.

Initially I was concerned about the shared bath situation and tried for a while to find a hotel where I'd have my own, but i could not find any other property that matched the pod's value and quality. You walk in the front door and the extremely hip lobby instantly puts you at ease - I was on the tenth floor and took the very slow elevator up and found yes my room was small, but it was so well designed it didn't seem to matter! That said i would not recommend putting more than one person into a single room, it really is designed for one! Other reviewers note they never had to wait for a bathroom, i kinda doubted it, but its so true, I never had to wait once! At most i think i saw the one bathroom being used on the floor at any one time.The location is fantastic there are heaps of places to eat and drink in the area, a couple of grocery stores and its a short walk up the road to a couple of different subway stations. The only real downside i had was that like many other reviewers noted, the banging doors at night can be annoying. Its almost impossible to close a door without making alot of noise.

What an amazing place!! Believe me, we couldn't have been more pleased! This hotel is truly the hidden jewel in NYC!We had a bunk room and it was perfect for us. Just like the other reviews have said, it was a tiny room. But, don't let that stop you! Everything in the room was very comfortable, clean, sleek, and modern. Our mattresses were firm and supportive, and the pillows and sheets were super comfy and didn't feel like standard hotel issued linens. Also, having our own flat screen tv's on each bunk was an awesome way for each of us to spend some time alone - even though we were still together in the room. You can watch the tv's with or without headphones. In our case, my daughter used her headphones on the top bunk while I chose not to use headphones on the bottom bunk. Watching our own favorite tv shows was a great way for us to unwind each night before we went to sleep. Before we got to the Pod, I was a little apprenhensive about the shared bathrooms. Even though all the reviews had been positive about them, I was still a little leary of their cleanliness and proximity to the room. I even worried about my daughter having to go down the hall by herself at night to use them. But, once we got there and I saw for myself how close the rooms were to the bathrooms, and how spotless they were, all my fears vanished! Again, the bathrooms were small, but they were exceptionally clean and modern. We stayed in on the second floor and our room was literally six steps away from two bathrooms. There was always a bathroom available for us whenever we needed it, too. The rainfall showerheads and the soft music in the bathroom also added to their charm. All in all, this hotel is amazing!!! The staff is friendly and helpful, the decor is funky, hip, and classy at the same time, and it's in a very safe, comvenient location.

The room was as described, small but new and decent. When I arrived though, there were bits of food left in the basin inside the room and I had to clean it off myself! :-(I didn't know that I would have issues with common bathroom until I experienced it. The bathrooms are generally clean though on my floor, there are only 4. At times, guests left used soaps and towels there when they are done and the maids couldn't remove the items in time. My main problem is that being female, I was just not comfortable walking around with wet hair or having to go back to the room to get toiletries I forgot to bring along. It's my own problem, I guess? I like the piped music in the bathrooms a lot, it's really soothing!Given that all the rooms are really small and the hallway is just two steps away from your bed, when someone comes back late in the night, you can hear the person; worse still if there are 2 or 3 of them and they don't have the courtesy to keep their voices down even when it's 2 a.m. in the morning. It happened every night during my stay, which was unfortunate.The hallway is dim even in the morning, this may be part of the design but I prefer public areas properly lit. Staff at the front desk were polite but not extremely helpful. The bell hop was very friendly but obviously overloaded. When I called him to help me with my 3 big bags (I was in the US for two weeks...), he told me that I had to wait for half an hour. In the end, it took me two trips to drag my bags down to the lobby. It took 15 mins. The elevators are very slow and stopped on almost every floor when I was there. As for the location, it's excellent. It's in a very good commercial district with Pax (the cafe ideal for breakfast) just two minutes' away (don't get cappucinos there, not really expresso coffee; the coffee of the day is OK and their sandwiches, delicious) and a even bigger suppermarket that comes with a deli serving decent pasta and snacks with great variety (pl see pic attached). The neighbourhood is safe.I agree with the previous reviewer that if you are on your own, Pod is a good choice. I took a look at the double room and the one with the bunk bed - for what the hotel charges, you may be better off with a full-service hotel.

I never had to wait for a bathroom, and I only saw 3 other guests in the hallway during my entire stay. Yes, you can hear other guests closing their doors from inside your room. I could hear other TV sets while standing in the hallways, but I could not hear them from within my room.I took shower shoes (flip flops that you would wear to the beach) because I knew about the shared bathrooms. Not really necessary, but I wanted to be prepared. If you have never been to summer camp, a youth hostel, or an Army barracks, the shared bathrooms might be concern. Fine for me, but would be a turn off to my girlfriend or my parents.Had difficulty with WiFi. Had to call tech support twice and spent 20 minutes each time. Once hooked up, it was fine. AC would cool room at first then it just quit. For that size room, it should have been freezing because outside was in the mid 80's.Plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars, and small grocery stores in the area.

If you have more than 3 big suitcases you may struggle but even then, you're in NYC - as long as you can get to the bed you'll be ok. We booked a 'double room' which as adequate for our needs. The walk in shower was a welcome retreat after a long days walking in NYC. With in easy reach of all the major sights (whether by metro, or by foot) you won't be dissapointed with the location. One tip, if you're planning on going up the Empire State Building, don't. Go up the Rockerfella instead.

I was hoping to get the 100$ price that so many say you can get, but ended up with taxes paying closer to 200. I booked a room with bunkbeds, as I was traveling alone.I was extremely happy with the location of The Pod. It is one train stop away from Grand Central and close to Rockefeller Plaza and excellent shopping on 5th Avenue.Yes, the rooms are small, so if you must have lots of space, then I don't recommend this hotel. I tried to imagine myself in the room with another person and found it would be tight, but there are a lot of ways to accommodate lugguage and clothing.Sharing the bathrooms/showers was not an issue, they were clean and I never had to wait long if all were occupied.I did head up to the roof, but as it was raining there was not much action up there. Seems like a lot of people will congregate in the lobby, so I assume if you were looking for new friends, you could probably find some.My biggest problem with The Pod was the noise. I was on the second floor in room 210. During the day there is the normal NYC street noise from cars, etc. In the evening I expected a certain amount of quiet and got none until about 2 a.m.. My room was directly above the restaurant below. I could hear conversations and laughing and music. It was awful!! I don't know if a room on the otherside of the hall would be better. I attribute being able to hear the noise to the fact that for air conditioning there is a unit in the window, so the noise travels because the window is not completely shut. A hard sleeper might not be bothered by this but I believe everyone else would. In the winter this could be different as I imagine the restaurant below would shut their windows and doors because of the cold.The wi-fi was out when I stayed and after a few complaints from other guest they posted signs. The docking station in my room did not work, so this was a bummer. So for this reason and the noise I rated my overall experience as average. Would I stay here again?

As a senior citizen I wasn't sure about the tiny rooms that I saw in the photographs on this website so I reserved a double room with private bath. Even then it was far less expensive than other hotels for the same night. When I arrived at 10:30 a.m. the room was not ready so I left my bag with the bellman and went off for the day. I would have preferred not to return to the hotel until after the evening theater performance but I wanted to be sure I had a room so I hiked back to 51st and 2nd after a matinee. I was upgraded to a suite on the 2nd floor. It had a sitting area and was quite large. Being The Pod I had expected hardly any space so the suite was a pleasant surprise. It had three windows that opened overlooking the street which was good and bad. Good since the air conditioner wasn't working and it was quite warm in the room but bad because the two restaurants directly below the windows did not close until 3 a.m. When I left for the evening after checking the room I told the woman at the front desk about the AC. I'm not sure it was checked while I was out and when I returned at midnight no one answered at the front desk when I called so I let it go - probably a mistake since I got little sleep with the street and restaurant noise below. Overall, the bed was comfortable enough and the room and bath were clean. The room was slightly tattered but fine for the short amount of time I was actually in it and the price was certainly much better than anywhere of comparable quality.

You have to be able to breathe in the room because it is essentially a place you retreat to after a busy day whether travelling on business or for pleasure. I also expect a hotel to deliver what it advertises, staff has to be friendly, professional and helpfull.Pros: cleanliness, styleCons: noisy, tiny room, elevatorWe stayed about 5 nights in this hotel in may 2008 over a period of two weeks. Reservations were made through a travel agent and you can choose between rooms with a private or shared shower/toilet. A double is basically a bunk bed and a queen size bed is smaller than a normal queen size bed. I'm not really sure if the hotel offers singles.Reception is to the point but not friendly.We choose to have a queen bed with private shower and toilet. The room was extremely tiny and they did everything to create as much rooms as possible with the capacity that they have. There is no place to store your luggage without tripping over it unless you place your luggage under or on the very tiny desk that you have. This tiny desk is in fact a larger bed side table. If you stay with 2 persons you cannot get around each other. You do have a small safe.The bed is too small for 2 people and oriented the wrong way. You have a headboard and two bed side table but you are sleeping alongside the headboard, your head against one bed side table, your feet against the other one. This is a problem if you your body height is on the large size.The hotel is extremely noisy. Sound isolation was not a priority. Doors and walls are paper thin and the crack between the door and the floor is about half an inch. The best thing that you can do is put your luggage on the floor in front of the door to block of the crack and the noise. But even then, bring earplugs because you are going to need them. During the first half of our stay, our room was located on the backside, the second half of our stay our room was located on the front side. Backside is worse but still better then the front side. You basically hear the people next door.You have a small flat screen located on a wall but positioned completely the wrong way and we were unable to turn or tilt it. Best way to watch TV is to simply stand in the pathway that goes from the door to the toilet/shower or bend your neck in a very uncomfortable way.There was a problem with the wireles internet but they posted a notice that they were working on it.The Pod hotel does not have a restaurant but does offer breakfast in the morning. This is on the expensive side and the bagels, croissants, etc. are not very fresh. There is a terrace and you are free to buy your breakfast/lunch/dinner somewhere else and bring it to the hotel. Best thing to do is walk 3 minutes to a store called Azure. The Pod hotel works with a restaurant located next door that offers French cuisine. The food is good but expensive. The wine list is huge. People that don't drink alcohol have one option: water. I would advise you to visit the other French restaurant (the one on your right side when you are standing in front of the entrance) and go for the Broadway show menu (served at specific hours). It was excellent and good value for money.Checkout in the hotel was not a problem but I expect hotel staff to always inquire if there were any problems. They didn't. I did not fill out a feedback card because there was none, my guess is that this is intentionally.Location: 8/10Staff helpfulness: 6/10Cleanliness of the room: 8/10Room size and decoration: 3/10Good night of sleep: 5/10Price was around $180 per night. You can get a room with a bunk bed shared shower/toilet as low as 100$. I did in fact got a glimpse of a room like that and I would suggest to go for this room. There is more space in the room (because there is no toilet and shower and the beds are much larger and comfortable + you each get your own little flat tv screen. The room that I saw also had a small hand washer. I also took a look at the shared shower/toilets and they looked pretty descent and clean.The hotel has only 2 elevators to cover 12 floors and they are slow. On average, we had to wait about 3 to 6 minutes before we were able to get into one. If you were lucky it did not stop on all the other floors.I would not stay in this hotel again unless I have no other choice, if so, I would go for the room with a bunk bed with a shared shower/toilet.",Belgium,73,1.0

Upon arrival, we were very impressed with the trendy and chic interior. Checking in was so quick and i quote what the dude at the counter said, ""I don't need no papers"". Within minutes we were in the lift, going up to dump our luggage. The only one thing i had a little 'ugh' with is the lift. If unluckily, it takes a couple of minutes to wait for one. Plus it's small so if two people are waiting with lugggage, and it's a little crowded, you'd have to wait for the next one. The room is small but enough to move around to pack or unpack. I fell in love with the rainshower! The toilet is great, sleek and sexy design. There's WIFI in the room so bring a laptop if you're the kind who can't live a day without checking your email. An iPod dock as well. The window can be opened so it's nice to pop your head out to get some air. Location is great too, food just below and down the street. There's a 24 hour shop called Azure down the corner at 51 St & Third Ave. Fruits, sandwiches, cereal, you name it. MacD's two shops down. The subway is a short walk too. You can walk to Fifth Ave, Radio City, the MOMA, Central Park.I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. We saw old couples, families, just about everyone at the hotel.

The shared bathrooms were always clean and tidy and we never had to wait for one. After reading other reviews I was a bit concerned about noise from other guests / outside, but the whole time I heard little to no noise from other guests and the noise from outside is what you'd expect in a city like NY but it never woke me up. There are plenty of bars/pubs and restaurants nearby, with many of them open late.

We booked our bunkbed rooms directly from them, but later realize we can also book them via other websites (eg. otel.com) that offer rebates for future use. Try them! The Pod was easy to find, within walking distance from the blue & green subway line. It's very chic, modern & hip. Very MOMA. The front desk allowed us to check in when we arrived at 11am+. The neighborhood has a hip & cozy feel to it too (safe too). We were worried about the room space as my hubby & I had 3 large cargo bags plus 1 cabin bag, but alas, all miraculously managed to fit into the room. The in-room stainless steel basin was a great convenient. The beds are comfortable & the lightings are great too. The small TVs are a great comfort. They don't replenish the toiletries, but perhaps the maid might give if requested. Yes, do ask for additional pillows too, as only 1 is given for each bed. The free Wi-Fi is fab as not many hotels in NY offers them! There's a rooftop floor at the 15th (go to 14th Floor & walk the stairs up to the 15th), a good skyline view of the city, day or night. There's many small eateries in the area, as well as a Duane Reade & Walgreen a block away. There's also a Food Emporium supermarket at 2nd Avenue, btw 51st & 52nd. The concierge desk has stacks of in-house created notes/survival tips as well as maps & NY mags, so be sure to ask for them! Ask the bell boy to book & pay for airport transportation service. It's USD20 per pax + USD 1 to driver per bag! Very good service door to door. We will be back!","Shanghai Region, China",5,4.0

I was visiting with a friend who was on a limited budget and agreed to stay at the POD. At first I was a little taken aback at the size of the bunk bed room, I had read some of the reviews and knew the rooms were small but wasn't really prepared for this. Being middle aged and it appeared most of the other guests were younger I debated looking for other hotel options.However we decided to give it a try for at least one night and I am quite happy we did. The POD is clean and in NYC that isn't always the case, certainly wasn't opulent in any way but for what you're being sold it's better than average. No issues with sharing the bathroom I never had to wait once in the 5 days, the beds were comfortable and the staff were good enough. The area is great its close enough to everything NY has to offer and the neighborhood is safe, lots of decent restaurants and cafes. I probably won't stay at the POD again but more because of my age than anything else. If your on a budget and want a decent clean place to stay in NY I would highly recommend the POD.

Each bunk bed was equip with its on 10"" TV - bring your earphones with you if you don't want to watch the same channel as your travel partner. It's a tight room but we pretty much only slept there so it was more than sufficient.We had to use the shared bathrooms but they were all VERY accessible and VERY clean everytime. We were on the sixth floor but I think every floor had 4 bathrooms - we never had to go to another floor to use the toilet once despite the hotel being VERY busy.For mid-town manhattan, this hotel is AWESOME! You can find places for cheaper but it was nice to get into a newer hotel and not have that hostel feeling. The location was great - two blocks to the subway and another two blocks to Rockafeller Center.There is a great deli/bakery store with awesome paninis, pizza and pasta called the PAX, a MacDonalds and a 24hr grocery store call AZURE at the end of the block.",Vancouver BC,2,4.0

Stayed in a bunk room with use of a shared bathroom. We've stayed in many hotels at a range of price levels and quality standards and found POD to be fantastic and great value for money in a city that is otherwise very expensive. Staff are extremely helpful (the concierge was faultless - we needed to print out some electronic tickets urgently and staff went to great lengths to do it for us and with a smile). The rooms including bathrooms, were lovely, good fixtures and fittings and kept spotlessly clean. The rooms felt safe and secure. WiFi worked perfectly all week. One of the great things we found about the hotel (apart from price!) was the great location central to everything if walking but just one block from the No.6 subway which runs the length of Manhattan putting you within 10 minutes of virtually everything. One issue was the slow lifts - and the hotel is busy which is fine if you are not in a hurry - our tip is ask for a low floor - we were on Level 2 which was perfect!

I am not one who would normallylike sharing a bathroom but it was absolutely no problem. We neverhad to wait for one and they were always very clean and private. I loved how the window opened in my favorite one on the 9th floor (#3) and you could take a shower (which was huge) and look outside if you wanted.It was nice having the shampoo and body wash already in the showersand each room had soap, shampoo, moisturizer by the sink. We askedfor extra blankets and pillows which we promptly received.The location was wonderful and we felt very safe. Yes it was noisy,but mostly from the outside (we were on the front on the hotel whichhad a very nice view but we did get the street noise. We were wokenup at 5 am one morning when we heard a large crash and looked out thewindow to see a lone driver had taken out 4 parked cars on the road,one of which was one of the police officers down the street. We wentto watch the commotion and it was very entertaining!!!It was my first trip to NY and loved it all, even the subways! You can get pretty much anywhere cheaply taking the subways. Buy a pass if you are there more than a few days. Well worth it! Even the cabs (when we could get one) were really reasonable.Anyway, checkout was a breeze and they held our bags and arrangedtransportation to JFKlater in the day. They offer a shuttle or a private car. We opted for the private car and for a 45 minute ride it was $45. Price is set no matter how long it takes.

It's safe to say that it was one of the most pleasant experiences of my life! I've had so much fun! Being a full-time student and not having a real job, I found the hotel to be a bit pricey at first. But I realized it wasn't so bad after all, considering it was in the middle of Manhattan. Plus, it was sooo cute! We couldn't resist! Overall, it was very clean, very cute and very cozy. The rooftop terrace was my favorite part. Location, definitely a plus. No complaints at all!All four of us arrived very tired and worn-out from the 8 hour bus ride. But once we stepped inside the lobby, we couldn't believe our eyes and were soon filled with excitement! It was incredibly well decorated for our 20 year old tastes.We felt as if we just stepped into a hip new lounge. There was a very nice mural, pretty lights and the best couch I've ever seen (it was so comfy too)! We checked-in and we were already up in our rooms in no time. We booked 2 rooms with bunk beds and shared bathroom for the 4 of us. I have to admit the rooms were pretty small, but we were only staying there for a weekend so it was not a problem at all. The beds were adorable and very comfy. I slept soundly every night. We even had a sink with mirrors so we could brush our teeth without having to go to the shared bathroom. The bathrooms were very clean and very modern. I loved the shower heads. We even had an indicator in our rooms that told us which bathrooms were free or occupied.

It is not for the person looking for a luxery. It is not for the person that is looking for the cheap motel, either.I had read many reviews of the place and chose it because of price, location and cleanliness. I was aware ahead of time of the things the Pod was not, and I was good with that. Other hotels in the area were much higher priced and we only wanted a place to rest our heads in between outings. This was PERFECT!The rooms are tiny, but every inch of the room is well used. We booked a double Pod and it had a private bath. We stayed for 4 nights, so the first thing we did when we arrived was unpacked our luggage and put things in their place. Their is plenty of drawer space under the bed and plenty of room on the desk for puting things. We made sure to bring luggage that nestled in each other and there was ample space to store the luggage in the bottom of the closet while we stayed. Another option might be to have the bell desk area store your empty luggage during your stay.The room was exceptionally clean and well kept throughout the stay. The bathroom is not very private, so as others have said in their review, make sure you are comfortable with the person you are rooming with. (or get a room with shared bath as those are very clean and always were available) The shower is glass and everything is in close proximity. The Pod is located close to many things. There are several subway stops within walking distance. We actually took the subway back to the airport from the hotel. It worked out great and was a TON cheaper than taking a cab (always $45) or a car back. Time's square and broadway are abouta 20 minute walk. Rockafeller Center and 5th Ave are just a tad bit closer. (Make sure you check out Top of the Rock!!!)There are several little restaurants and places to grab groceries or deli items very close by. There's a great little Bagel shop around the corner. We grabbed the list from the hotel with suggestions of places to dine and there were some fabulous suggestions on there. Grab an incredibly amazing Australian burger at Ruby's in Little Italy (Little Australia). It's a tiny place but the food is AMAZING!!! Also, dinner at Primola is a MUST!! We changed our plans when we read the review....""It's like looking into the eyes of God...a Religous experience"". THAT IT WAS! Service was incredible, wine wonderful, food was just tantilizing!

The first time went well, hence my choice to stay a second time. Both stays we chose the bunk bed and shared bathroom option. The first stay was on a lower floor (2nd or 3rd) which had 4 bathrooms on the floor. It was very convenient and clean. The second time around we were on the 12th floor, which has only 2 bathrooms on the floor but with the same number of rooms to share 2 bathrooms versus 4 baths. Major problem - the bathrooms quickly became dirty (towels left on the floor, water EVERYWHERE, clogged toilets, overflowing trash, etc) and were only cleaned once a day. IF I stay at The Pod again, I'll request a floor with 4 bathrooms or I'll get a Queen room, however for that price I'm sure there are other places to stay. Additionally, the coffee offered in the morning on the terrace was $4/SMALL cup. The next morning we walked down the block to the corner market and got 16 oz cups for $2.

The general facilities are great, ipod doc, tv's and free internet access for every room, you couldnt really ask for much more - even the location is great, its close to the MoMa, Top of the Rock, 5th Ave shops and a subway.I cant recommend the Pod Hotel enough.

I have stayed in some B & B's all over the UK and I can tell you the single room at the POD is bigger then a lot of the rooms I have stayed in over there. The room is designed well and I could easily fit my opened large suitcase on the floor. Everything worked well in my room and everything was so clean. The bed was comfy and the flat screen in the wall was great. The shared bath was lovely and convenient. I had friends meet me here and we went up to the roof deck as it was a beautiful day. The lounge area is also very comfortable to sit in and use your computer et. The staff is very nice and PLEASE even tho this is a budget hotel remember to TIP your maids. They work so hard and leaving $2. in the room each day should not break your bank. If you can't then maybe you should think 2x about taking a holiday. There are LOTS of great restaurants and bars right below and around the corner from the POD. Check out the STAR DINER around the corner for great breakfast and the Italian place next to it is really good. Also, the French place right below is a nice spot for a drink at night. The number 6 train is just 2 blocks down. I did not have ANY problems with noise. Yes, you can hear the doors close at times but nothing out of the ordinary. I also felt VERY SAFE here at the POD. A big factor if you are a woman traveling alone. So, it is all good at the POD!!!!",Los Angeles,11,5.0

It was a little noisy at times--especially when some (I'm guessing drunk) twenty-somethings were partying in the hallway one night...come ON you're in the big apple! Get out and do something instead of bothering your hotel neighbors!--but it was actually much more quiet than I thought it would be after reading the other reviews on this site. The customer service was great, very friendly and helpful staff, and it's a safe neighborhood with lots of restaurants, delis, and more upscale spots that are still somewhat affordable nearby. The free wifi was also excellent, as I was in town on business and needed to get some work done.

After coming from the Hilton on Ave. of America it was a little step down. However, for the money it was well worth it. My friend and I got a room with bunk beds, and it was sufficient for the two of us. We were able to put our luggages in the corner and they were not in the way. The only concerne I had was the shared bathrooms since I seem to be a little quirky about some stuff. Our floor (3)had 4 bathroom with shower, and believe me each one is different, #3 was the best and roomiest. The shower had plenty of room and as a bonus had extra shower heads positioned on my lower back which is great after a day of walking around NYC.There is a subway stop a few blocks away and Times Sq. and Rockefeller are a short walk. This place is CLEAN and the sheets and bed are comfortable, for the price you can't find anything that compares.Really, you only need a place to sleep since NYC has so much to offer. Also, if you buy the New York Pass and not the City pass you get the best deal for your money. It is a pass that let you in almost everything from museums to back stage tours, bronx zoo, madame Trussands, harbor tours, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island.

They were wide, had great sheets and each bed had a small flat screened TV on an arm adjusting in your bed with earphone jacks if you wish. Also, lots of practically thought out storage, hooks, room safe, a desk with clock radio and I-POD connect with speakers. We did have a sink with a small vanity area- mirror, but your toilet & shower is down the hall. It seemed to me that there were 4 on my floor. Pretty spacious and clean. That is saying a lot because I am a slight germaphobe. They do provide towels etc. I would bring flip flops/shower shoes and there is an indicator light in your room when they are available. I never had any problems. Check in and check out was smooth. They are full of info and provide daily print outs of things to do, weather etc. Very swanky decor, you will want to do more then just sleep & shower.

The corridors are pokey but not too much of a problem.The rooms themselves are naturally very small but really well laid out to make the most of the space. I got a room with a bathroom and it was good (although the visibility of the toilet means you need to be pretty secure with your partner). I was alone and loved it for what it was.

Having stayed at other hotels in the area, after reading about the Pod Hotel, I wanted to give it a try.If you are going to spend 7AM - 10PM or later outside of your hotel room and just need a place to crash, stay here. The utilitarian, modern, sleek and minute rooms lend themselves to people who are not in NY for the luxury NY hotel experience, but rather are there for the experience outside of the hotel room.I absolutely loved my standard queen sized pod room with the bath attached, and found that for a four night stay it was perfect. The use of space in these rooms is incredible, and if you unpack yourself as soon as you get in the room and make use of the hanging rack and drawers, you will be able to navigate the room without trouble. One night there were some loud folks across the hallway who woke me around 12AM (I had a 5:30AM wake up call), and within ten minutes of calling the front desk to complain, I heard a knock at the door across the hall from a member of the staff who immediately told the guests to keep it down. I fell right back to sleep.Again, if you're well-traveled, and spend time in your hotel room only to sleep and change and get ready for what the next day has in store, this is a great place to crash. If you want room service, people waiting on you hand and foot, and luxury bath towels, don't bother.

Our budget wasn't massive but we did want somewhere that would be definately clean and a lot of the reviews for hotels mentioned bugs and dirt and unclean rooms however the pod had fairly positive reviews and even though it was a little bit more expensive we booked it because it looked clean and was pretty new. The photos looked amazing however when we arrived at the hotel the balconey area was completely closed off. There was no explaination of note explaining why it was closed which I was very disappointed about. There was no hotel bar or restaurant either as a communal area, there were some chairs but no reason to sit on them. The actual room was small but we had expected that. It was also very hot as we were very high up but as it was freezing outside I was grateful. The rooms were cleaned every day and the shower was amazing. The doors do bang when they close though. The hotel is very near tube stations so we were able to get around quite easily and we ate at a different place everyday, there are so many so didn't mind there not being one in the hotel that much. All in all I had an amazing holiday and the hotel was great for just a base which we didn't really spend much time in.

I stayed in a twin bed w/ shared bath@ $99. Initially, I was scared at the idea of a shared bath and this was not the luxury mode of hotels that I was used to but had heard nothing but good things about it and decided to go out of my comfort zone- and it was well worth it.Located on the eastside of Manhattan closer to high-retail stores like Gucci, Tiffany's etc about 8 blocks away, it is worth another stay for me.Although everything is streamlined like no ice bucket in the room and only one drinking glass, I liked the idea of having a sink, IPOD dock, flatscreen tv. glass around the sink and a dimmer switch for my lights. The nice little desk w/ FREE internet access is a bonus. I was in the hotel for a limited time but loved the nice European style w/ the many foreign visitors.

The Pod Hotel, though, lived up to the glowing TA reviews. The place is minimalist and super-cool. The attention to detail in the Pod is well worth sacrificing the extra space of a regular hotel for. The people who run the place have really gone the extra mile to make the Pod a nice place to be in. Favourite aspects included the rain-head showers and piped music in the shared bathrooms, the iPod clock radio, and the very funky-utilitarian wooden shutters on the window. My room was fresh and clean; while it got quite warm at times, the combined heater/AC was very easy to operate. I found no problems with noise - could hear other guests close their doors, but not so loudly as to disturb. The room was pretty quiet (it faced away from the main road). There was always at least one bathroom free and they were extremely clean and well-maintained.My only quibble with the design is that there really isn't anywhere to put your stuff - the sign on the door suggests you use the under-bed drawers, but this just isn't convenient for a two-night stay. While I didn't find the lack of space in the room a problem, there is no good place to put your bag, let alone to unpack it. The shared bathrooms also lacked any kind of shelf to put your clothes on while having a shower - this would have been very useful. Otherwise, though, this is a really excellent place. The ambience, details and general 'feel' of the stay place are more like a trendy boutique hotel than a budget hotel. I recommend the Pod with no reservations.","Haifa, Israel",43,5.0

Location-wise it's perfect, as others have said take the shuttle from the airport ($20 so not much more than public transport and it's a door-to-door service) and definitely check out the roof terrace and garden during your stay. Also if you're looking for something to eat (24 hours!) try Sarge's Deli on 3rd Ave between 36th and 37th. The pizza from the deli on the corner of 51st and 3rd is pretty good too if you're hungry.The beds are comfy and the room has everything you need...it's just exceptionally tiny. Don't get me wrong, for the money it's great and if like me you're a traveller who has a hotel room purely to sleep in then ordinarily it'd be ok, except both of you trying to stand up next to each other at the same time is a feat of acrobatics! Other than that I can't fault the accom, the shared bathrooms were always exceptionally clean, the maids were really helpful and chatty whenever we saw them and we didn't have any noise issues with other guests.Overall I was impressed, I'd stay here again if I had budget in mind, but for comfort I might splurge for a bigger room.

It woke me up a couple times but my son slept right thru it. The second night was better because we came home from a long day of walking and shopping to find a group of foreign students had been put on the same floor and were loud and rude. I asked them nicely to stop yelling up and down the halls to each other (right outside my door) but they pretended not to understand english). So of course, I called the front desk and they moved us up to the 11th floor in the back, away from the party. I was very pleased with their quick response to be moved. The second nite was very quiet and we got our sleep.  The hotel itself was extremely clean(I think they pump the scent of soap into the air vents=) Loved the ipod docking stations. Loved the rain shower heads(heavenly). Loved the set up of the rooms. The only thing missing was a kids network on the telly.

Instead of giggling at its oddness or oohing and ahhing at its cleverness, I found myself marveling at the accurate descriptions other Tripadvisor contributors have offered. The Pod Hotel offers economical (for New York, which is perhaps not saying much) accommodations in a great location, and its concept is just different enough to have me wondering why there aren't more of these hotels--especially in cities where rooms are expensive and often shabby. Though traveling solo, I was assigned to a bunk-bed room, which was great fun. This resembled nothing so much as my college dorm, except immaculate. Each bunk had its own reading light and a small flat-screen hotel on a swinging arm. There was a small desk with an alarm clock/radio/iPod dock and a well-designed sink along one wall, with plenty of towels (smallish, but adequate). As others have noted, the bathrooms are just a few steps down the hall, you never seem to have to wait for one at all, and even the bathrooms manage to stay perfectly clean--and even dry. Whatever windows they're using, they also manage to keep all the noise of midtown Manhattan out of the room.Pod Hotel has a smart lobby--you won't be embarrassed if friends or business acquaintances drop you off here--and enough standard hotel features (a bellhop, a concierge) to make it a sensible choice. The location, too, is sensible--a fashionable street with embassies and cafes not far from the United Nations, with two subway lines within a couple of blocks. This hotel's unusually small rooms wouldn't be ideal in every situation, but for a simple overnight business trip when I wasn't carrying a lot of baggage, it was a perfect choice.","Los Angeles, California",106,4.0

Although small the space was well designed and there was enough shelves and drawers to stow everything.My room and the shared bathroom were cleaned to a high standard.There is a good selection of breakfast and lunch to eat in or out at nearby Pax or Azure just a few minutes walk away on the corner of Third Avenue and East 51st Street.I would definitely stay there again.","London, United Kingdom",10,4.0

The bathrooms are as calm and lovely as they look. The view sucks, but who gets a hotel in New York to stay inside and look at the view? With the money you save, you can go up the Empire State Building once a day!!The elevators are really the only part of your experience that give away the Pod hotel's history as an older hotel (Paxton Arms, I think?) -- they are very slow and seldom. Sometimes I just took the stairs, but if you don't fancy 11 flights of stairs, think about requesting a lower floor.Don't worry about bringing along much for supplies: each room has shampoo, soap, a hair dryer, towels, lotion, a water glass, and even a bath mat (so you don't have to stand on a wet floor in the tiny bathrooms). There's also a nice flatscreen TV on the wall, although only about 10 channels. but, again, who comes to NYC to watch TV?It's about 2.5 blocks from the 51st street station, which is on the 4/5/6 line -- mostly convenient, depending where you want to get to. Not really a nightlife district, but within walking distance of lots of nightlife.Really important fact: it is very close to both a Pax restaurant (healthy, cheap-ish food) and a grocery store (forget the name: Allure? Azure?) that is open, as far as I could tell, 24 hours, and has a huge hot buffet, salad/fruit bar, eating area, etc. You can have some great, cheap meals there, and fresh fruit too.Overall: great rooms, great service, great price.

We left some left over pizza in our room and returned to the room after a few drinks in time square to tuck into the leftovers to find the pizza covered in roaches ( I must say at this point the pod hotel has the best hygiene standards i've ever seen and is no way dirty, leaving food around in NYC was our rookie mistake!).

If you are planning on staying with someone in the room, you better make sure you are very comfortable with them. There is no door for the toilet or shower so everything is exposed. I could lay on my bed and wash my hands in the sink at the same time, and touch the toilet and shower-that is how close everything is together. It was clean and cute, but I am so glad I only stayed there for 3 nights. By the third night, I needed to get out of such a small space.","San Francisco, CA",17,3.0

I should say that we are both middle -aged professors. We were in NYC for a large academic conference and we have a daughter living in the East Village. I love ipods and wireless-friendly places so I was oriented toward places like the Pod. My wife doesn't care about that and didn't complain about where we were until other conference goers talked about how much room they had with similar per night charges.When we first got to our room, which unlike many other Pod rooms had a bath and kind of deluxe I guess for the hotel, I was reminded of a ship or a boat. The bathroom was very undersized, stainless steel and subway tile, but doable. [Large people would be challenged.] Let me say with a minimum of delicacy that a slight passing of wind in the bathroom was shared by all.We were located in a corner room on the 11th floor and had a pretty good view, especially at night. [I’ll upload a night photo I took outside our window when I get around to it.] The staff was pretty friendly. I would give the service about a 3 out of 5, largely because the cleaning staff didn't clean very well or change our water glasses without prodding. I would suppose that was because the younger folks in very small rooms and little neatness ethic gave them little room to work with.The location is very good. Two blocks from the No. 6 subway; a block in either direction from good delicatessen food; a block or so from several excellent Irish bars and a very good Thai restaurant.So, bottom line: At the end of a 9-day stay I had a $2500 hotel bill and had had good wireless, OK service, small yet efficient, lodgings and a good NYC location. I was not enthralled with my experience. But, perhaps Manhattan is just beyond my pay grade. If we were considering a vacation alone, NYC would not be our first choice—even for me—who loves cities.When I return to NYC, I will consider basing my hotel outside of Manhattan, but near a subway that can get me where I need to go. In my view, the subway system is the key to finding interesting and cost-effective lodging in NYC. Mid-town Manhattan, at least, is just too damn expensive.As an aside--NYC is a good place NOT to drink economically. The meals are generally reasonable. Drinks are outrageous. Alcohol is clearly a big factor in any NYC restaurant's business plan.","Mobile, AL",34,4.0

As a graduate student (a broke one at that!), I was looking for an affordable stay for the week that was close to the action, safe, and clean. The Pod had everything I was hoping for plus more. The hotel had friendly staff, free wifi, and interesting aesthetic. I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends or to return. My roommate also is planning to return in May for a trip with her husband. We occupied a bunk room (will attempt to post a picture later when I'm completely unpacked) which was slightly smaller than my first dorm room (I'm guessing 8 by 12 feet). We stayed for 7 days for a total of $796 (split, approximately $400). We couldn't have done better in a suburb. We also had a shared shower because we wanted separate beds and low cost. Having never stayed in a hostel (which this is not), I had never shared a bathroom but in a hotel like this I would do it again. The bathrooms were kept clean (number 3 on the 9th floor was our favorite because it was quite large), had shampoo and shower gel. My only complaint was lack of space but we both had very large suitcases and two carry-ons a pieces. We were well aware in advance of the space and should have done a better job packing. My roommate claims to have seen a single roach in one bathroom but I never saw one and I have to imagine that even the best hotels have one or two in their most humid spots. The hotel is close to two small grocery stores and several small deli/cafe-like restaurants. The subway is a couple of blocks away. A cab to Madison Sq. Garden/Penn was only $7.60 so travel to and from the train is fairly cheap if you have to use the cab b/c of baggage.","Chapel Hill, NC",11,4.0

I stayed in a twin room - it was fairly small but nevertheless it was fine for me - there was enough space to store my things, relax, & sleep which are surely the main purposes of a hotel room. The bed was comfortable enough - I was able to sleep well. I was quite apprehensive about the noise mentioned in other peoples reviews which i read before staying in the Pod as i am a light sleeper, but after a busy day in New York i was able to sleep well all but 1 of the 7 nights so this wasnt a problem. If you are a light sleeper then earplugs are advisable as there is some noise, but it is bearable - i only wore my earplugs 1 night out of the 7 i was there.The rooms are fine - chair, table, sink, electronically locking safe, and storage space and were very good value for the price i payed ($109 per night) in somewhere like New York.The location is excellent - i was able to walk to everywhere i went - times square, central park, empire state, macy's, american museum of natural history, etc (except once when i took the subway to brooklyn bridge further south). There are plenty of places to eat nearby - Pax has some great breakfasts (pancakes & syrup, bagels etc at a fair price, not cheap but not particularly expensive), Azure has a large variety to choose from for meals - it is slightly expensive but alright as far as prices go.Other features of the hotel: the rooftop gives an excellent view of the area & some great photo opportunities, the shared bathrooms (4 per floor - about 40 rooms i think) were kept virtually spotless & there was always at least 1 free - easily worth it for the saving you make in comparison to having your own), the lifts were ok.The only main problem we had was with some of the staff at the check in desk as there was some confusion regarding how much we owed for the rooms (at one point i was locked out of my room!) but this was resolved and was alright in the end. The Pod Hotel is a very good hotel for travellers on a budget and was easily adequate for my stay.","London, United Kingdom",6,4.0

We booked the room w/ the bunk bed and shared bath for a very reasonable rate in Manhattan. We were conveniently located to the metro and walking distance to 5th Avenue. We even made the trek by foot coming home some nights from watching Broadway musicals. The concierge -- I can't remember his name! -- was very, very helpful. He even made me a print out of things to do and see in Manhattan. I still have it for my next trip to the Big Apple. The lobby was very sheek and modern. The room was clean and the shared bathrooms were also very clean. They have a very convenient system to tell you if any of the bathrooms were vacant. They provided shampoo/conditioner/soap dispensers but I used my own so I can't tell you if their products were good or not. If you've ever stayed in a hostel I would have to say it's a lot nicer than some of the Europe hostels we stayed at. Just don't expect a 5 star hotel or anything.All in all, the hotel was very convenient and reasonably priced for its location. I think it might be more suitable for singles and younger people, but then I saw a lot of older couples too. I'd definitely come back.","Los Angeles, CA",20,4.0

I expected that and was actually looking forward to it as part of ""the charm"". I travel 1 to 2 times per month for business and have found that in the past 10 years virtually every hotel I've stayed at has upgraded beds, comforters, pillows, towels, etc. These are the basics. I don't expect fancy, just comfortable. At the Pod hotel you will get a hard, too short mattress (I'm 5' 10""), a paper thin blanket (and only 1), and towels that are just plain tiny (and not provided in quantity to make up for the size). There was a small flat screen TV in my room. While the size was fine given the size of the room, the positioniing made it uncomfortable to watch from the bed. To top things off, the promised ""Free WiFi"" was too weak to establish a reliable connection in my 10th floor room. I booked a queen room and when I got there it wasn't available and then put me in a smaller size room and knocked $30 bucks off my price. All that said, if you need a cheap room and this is the best you can find, I will say that it was clean and in a safe part of town. HOWEVER, you should know that it won't always be cheap. For example, I am traveling back to NYC and am staying at the NY Hilton for $200/night, less than I paid at the POD. I've stayed at the NY Hilton before and love it.P.S. Despite my ""family of 5"" screen name, I was traveling alone.","Somerville, Massachusetts",13,2.0

The bunk beds were comfortable and with private tv's on each bunk, when we came home at night, she could watch whatever in her bunk and her auntie could catch up on MSNBC! It is small but loved the sink in the room. I don't mind shared bathrooms, a little Purell on the seat and you are good to go. Our in-room display of which bathrooms were free did not work but I always found one open (there were 4 on our floor). Bathrooms were mod and hip. Rooftop is great. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Great location and staff. The web showed wood floors but we had dark brown carpeting, my only complaint. It was clean and hip and that is all I could have asked for.","washingon, dc",0,5.0

The location is excellent -- we walked to Times Square, Rockafeller Center, Central Park, etc. with no problem. It seems like a safe area, and right in the middle of things. The decor is very cool, and there's always ambient music playing in the lobby, hallways, and bathrooms. You can take the stairs up to the roof and get a good view of the city, too. The rooms are small, but the space is used really well. Check out the pictures I posted for an idea. Each room has a sink, which is nice since the bathrooms are shared -- so you don't have to walk down the hall to brush your teeth. We had a bunk bed room (for only $100!), and each bed had a little flat-screen TV on an arm attached to the wall that could be extended and adjusted. Another nice touch was the ipod dock/radio; we brought a jazz playlist, which went nice with the modern atmosphere. :)The bathrooms are wonderful! I don't mind at all walking down the hallway to get to them. They are NOT like dorm rooms or hostels! They are individual bathrooms, each with a toilet, sink, and shower, and the decor there is also cool. The shower heads are awesome -- really big, and attached to the ceiling. Ambient music there, too, which I thought was a nice touch. Might get on some people's nerves, I suppose. In each room there are lights above the door that let you know when the bathrooms are occupied. I only ever saw one light on at a time; we had no problem with crowding at all.One final thing I want to mention about the pod! Right around the corner is a Japanese restaurant called Gyu-Kaku... it is AMAZING! We walked there (literally about 3 minutes). We didn't need to worry about walking around late at night because it was so close, and the food was great. It's one of those yakiniku places where you grill meat and veggies on your table (not a Japanese steakhouse -- look it up if you've never been to one, they are great). A little pricey, but we saved so much money staying at The Pod, we didn't mind paying $80 or so for a big dinner for two!","Austin, Texas",13,5.0

The Location is perefect for seeing all the sights with central park, times square, and the UN all in close reach. there are also 2 subway stations very close by, for those things that are a bit too far to walk. I had a single room which was larger than i had expected from seeing other peoples photos on this site and others. The bed was nice, and the room on the whole was well equiped (it had a nice iPod alarm clock thing, but the time was wrong, and i couldnt work out how to change it), there is a safe, but it isnt massive, so i wouldn't try and bring large valuable items and plan to leave them in it. The shared bathrooms were nice, always clean, good showers, and there was always at least one free when i needed it. The majority of the staff were friendly and helpfull during the stay. There are a few good breakfast places very nearby, e.g. Pax and Azure. The view from the roof is pretty cool, just make sure you get up there while its open, because it's closed by 9pm.

Myself and my boyfriend spent 6 nights here from the 28th February and I have nothing but good things to say about the place. I've stayed in many hotels in New York, at various price points and let me tell you, not one of them matched the Pod. Upon arriving at the Pod you immediately know you have made the right decision. It's cool, airy, and the staff are extremely friendly. Yes the lift is slightly slow, but you are staying in one of the most fast paced cities in the world, sometimes it's nice to take a moment to slow down! The rooms are brilliant, small but perfectly formed. They have thought of everything, drawers under the bed, little cubby holes around the sink. Every bit of space utilised well. We stayed in a double room and it was exactly what we needed for our stay. The bathroom, while a little unconventional was great, wonderful shower, although like others have mentioned, you really do need to know who you are traveling with, the window into the shower is completely see through!!! Everyday the room was cleaned to a really high standard, even the shared bathrooms were super clean.The location couldn't be better, walking distance to the Rockefellar centre(be sure to go to the top, the view is AMAZING!) The subway is also couple of blocks away. And when you get too tired/lazy cabs are really easy to come by at the end of the street.There are some nice places to eat near by. Pax at the end of the street is good for bagels and granola in the morning. There is a Sushi restaurant to the right of the Pod, Tanakra?? The best Sushi I have had in a long long time.

The Pod is extremely clean, the maids are really efficient, just leave the maid sign out and your room was cleaned either in the morning or afternoon (by the way a few dollars on the pillow each day for them is the done thing, you don't know if the same maid is fixing your room all week to tip them at the end - it's their lively hood) The area and hotel felt safe, and you are close to the main sites and shops.

The rave reviews for the Pod hotel and its funky design struck a chord with us so we decided to book our 4-night stay online using the Pods reservation page. Its been a long time since the student days where we did the communal loo thing so we opted for the double bedroom with en suite.En suite? Now lets be honest, the rooms are tiny, albeit exceptionally functional and clean and the toileting facilities are spotless but there really is no privacy at all, its literally 'open plan'. I found this rather uncomfortable, as there are occasions when you need you're own privacy, regardless of how well you know your partner.I defintely recommend the shared bathroom option. Not only will you get the same comfy, clean rooms, they'll be around 100 quid cheaper a night and you have the option of 4 bathrooms with music, shower, loo and soap. There is a wee light that tells you which are free and you get your privacy. We're going to go back to this hotel on our return trip to NYC and going for the bunk beds next time. The location of the hotel is really central with some good food places around and its a relatively quiet street so its not too noisy at night.

It was very clean, modern, stylish and well maintained and that was just the reception area! Our queen size room with a private bath continued the theme. The photos on the website were a true representation. It was very clean (we can't emphasize this enough) and very well designed. The use of space was just amazing! The bed was comfortable and there was an extra blanket if you needed it.A bit of advice for the girlies. Don't bother taking a hairdryer as the one provided is powerful enough to dry long hair. Also the difference in voltage wouldn't even switch on my hair straighteners so it was a waste taking them :(!The Pod is very well located and we walked everywhere and felt very safe at all times. There are great cafes nearby and would recommend the Morning Star round the corner. Pax on the corner of 51st and 3rd is great for breakfast and there's a great pizza and pasta place between 50th and 49th on 2nd.As for excursions we'd recommend:Woodbury Common shopping outlet has every store imaginable and the bargain prices are unbelieveable. 4 pairs of Timberland boots for $220! Check out the website to get a deal on bus travel. (We saved $40 by booking before we left UK.) Go early in the day coz the place is huge! We also took a 30 minute helicopter ride over New York for our wedding anniversary. Absolutely amazing and well worth the money! The photos came out really well.The one thing we wouldn't advise is taking the shuttle bus back to the airport as recommended by the Pod staff. We were the first pick up at 1515hrs and went round 6 other hotels uptown before heading for the airport. What should have taken 1 hour if we'd taken a private taxi ended up taking 2!! Be warned!!All in all our stay at The Pod was excellent value for money and we can't recommend it highly enough.

I loved my stay there - always clean, great WIFI, convenient and safe. As previous reviews have stated, the walls are thin and the doors do slam, so the success of your stay is highly dependent on the courtesy of your neighbors. If they chat until 2:00 in the morning you will be part of the conversation. This only happened a couple of nights for me and I was very grateful.If you have rolling or little luggage, getting there is a breeze from JFK. Just take the AirTrain and the E train and for $7 you're only a couple of blocks away. February was off-season, so I was able to get excellent deals from Hotels.com and Skoosh (yes, i made two separate reservations to get the best deals). At the time they were better rates than the direct hotel website. It's worth it to shop around. A little secret. Although you won't find them on their website or any of the standard hotel websites, they do have singles with a private bath. I loved my little single room. It's worth asking for directly from the hotel, if that suits your style. All in ail, The Pod hotel is where I will return when in NYC.","Duluth, MN",9,4.0

So far they have all been spot on and this was no exception. The Pod is well situated with good connecting Metro lines just round the corner. Good diners nearby for breakfast (Morning Star Cafe good) just round the corner and surrounded by Irish Pubs, Murphy's notable if you are looking for one in the area. There's also Pax on the corner for snacks and a minimart nearby also. 15-20 mins walk into Times Square / Midtoiwn area, and seems to be a good, safe area. Hotel itself as other reviewers has small rooms. Originally i'd booked the Bunk room but was given a free ""upgrade"" to the double room. Room held me, my wife and our suitcases, thats about it. Small but fine. I didn't come to New York to sit in a room. Room tidied every day to a good standard. Toilets where shared - always clean and never too far away from a free one. Problems? Our heating failed, but the reception had fixed in a day when we were out sightseeing. Doors closing are noisy, you have to physically shut them to make them close when adds to the problem. If you're a light sleeper you may have issues. WiFi is free, you need a access key from reception but it works fine. Apart from that nothing really.

The reason I chose the Pod for this stay is because I booked a room there for early April, and I thought this would be a good way to try the hotel to see if I'd stay again in April for a longer stay. Everything seemed to work out. In fact, I recommended the Pod to a professional group I'm affiliated with for its Spring Meeting in April.As other reviewers have said, the hotel was clean, the staff was very helpful, and the rooms were small. This was also the first time I had stayed in a shared bathroom environment since college and the bathrooms were clean and worked flawlessly. The shower was a little awkward to use because of its size, but the shower head was phenomenal! I was on the 2nd floor, so I couldn't control the radiator; I was also next to a stairwell, which got a little noisy one night. When I checked out, I mentioned this to the front desk staff and that I had a reservation in early April, and they noted my April reservation to put me on a higher floor away from the stairs.The bed was nice and so was the pillow, even for a big person like me with an iffy back. Also, my room had a sink basin in it, so I could brush my teeth, etc. in my room. The only thing I thought was pointless was a chair in the room- my room was so small that I don't know if a 2nd person would have fit & been comfortable sitting in the chair.On Sunday morning, I found a cafe about 2 blocks south of the hotel, as well as a Starbuck's. There's also a nice little bar down the street if you want a drink before going to sleep. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and generally clean.One last thing: the hotel has a very non-traditional flavor to it, so be prepared! Oh, and you can take a door-to-door shuttle to/from the airport for $16-18 each way, which is way cheaper than a cab.","Syracuse, New York",0,4.0

This was an absolute bargain for the location.When we arrived we were checked in straight away by the friendly receptionist. We found the room to be small but adequate for our needs as we didn't go to New York to stay in the room all the time.I would suggest that if you do not know the person you are traveling with very well book a shared bathroom room, as the en-suite is not very private. We did notice that the shared bathrooms were spotlessly clean, and always available.The room was kept spotlessly clean by the staff, and towels and bedding were changed daily. The receptionist was always available and helped us set up the wireless internet on our laptop (password required). The internet was quick and allowed us to use skype to video chat with family in the UK. The room also had a built in electronic safe, which was free and had just about enough space to fit my laptop in (vertically) which was brilliant. Also the room featured a LCD TV with lots of channels.The hotel is in a brilliant location, about a 10 min walk to The Rockefeller Centre, 5mins walk to Bloomingdales, 15min walk to Times Square and 15mins walk to Empire State / Macys. We only really used the subway to go Downtown (WTC, Brooklyn Bridge) or If we were feeling lazy.There is a good deli a few doors away called Pax, which sells fresh Breakfasts, Salads, Sandwiches etc and also a fantastic French Bistro next door to the hotel called Montparnasse. Montparnasse has a pre theatre 3 course dinner which was fantastic and really good value.We would definitely come back to this hotel as its location is great, and although the room was small was fine for us and spotlessly clean.","Hong Kong, China",3,5.0

""Surely must be a dump!"" Well, be prepared to be very pleasantly surprised. The Pod offers excellent lodging for the price. It's not for the heavy in girth since beds are small as are the rooms; however, if you don't mind small spaces you'll be fine. Even though small, the room accommodated two comfortably when a friend came up while I finished dressing. The room is appointed in modern decor, down to the stainless steel sink, mod motif bed coverlet, and flat screen plasma TV on the wall. The twin sized bed was extremely comfortable and the pillow felt like sleeping on a cloud. The staff is friendly and efficient. Being from the south I was unaccustomed to room heat set to cycle every 40 minutes, so I initially thought there was no heat. Upon reporting it to the front desk, it was explained how the heat worked, yet the receptionist offered to send someone up to make sure it was indeed working. Shortly thereafter, the heat came on and from that time forward kept the room very toasty. (As a matter of fact I actually opened the window a bit for ventilation.) Everything is kept very, very clean. The bathroom I used was splendid and a mere few steps from my door. Overhead shower head and jets! Modern sink, soft music, marble/slate tiled shower and floor. Though there isn't a restaurant in the hotel, around the corner is the Morning Star Cafe, an excellent selection for breakfast (eat-in or on the go)! I will stay at the Pod anytime I visit New York and will recommend it to everyone.

That is the perfect time to try the Pod hotel. The location is great - totally walkable from Grand Central if that is your jumping off point. If you are on a budget, take the $12 bus from the airport and it drops you off directly at Grand Central - can't get cheaper than that! Where to eat - Dos Caminos! It is literally 2 blocks away, and is an upscale mexican restaurant with the best tableside guacamole around. If you are into getting your nails done on the cheap, there is a great place just a few doors down from the hotel as well. And on 2nd avenue there is an amazing cupcake shop. The room will be better than you expect, and it was comfortable. Not the best beds in the world, but better than many. We had 2 single beds, and a bathroom in our room - the bathrooms are laughably small, and it is even hard to shower without banging your elbows. But it was fine, really. Not the end of the world. The key is the rooms were CLEAN - unlike many 2 and 3 star hotels in NYC. We actually used the shared baths in the hallway a few times, and they were also very, very clean and always available. The rooms do have TVs which is a nice amenity. The lobby of the hotel has lots of seating, and people seemed to be hanging around a lot - the hotel overall has a good vibe.Don't expect to check-in early at this hotel - as there is always a line of people waiting. I would say don't even come until 3pm, although you can drop your bags while you wait as well. The staff were very nice, and are good with directions and recommendations.There are great deals in NYC on priceline and hotwire typically, but for those peak times when there is nothing available I would definitely do the Pod again!","Minneapolis, Minnesota",207,4.0

I was impressed at the efficient design of the room and marvelled that they could get a toilet, shower, sink, desk, double bed, and small closet into a room that was barely more than 9 x 11. However, this means that only the closest and most comfortable of people can share this room. We chose to use the communal bathroom down the hall instead of our own toilet on some occasions. There is no privacy whatsoever in the room.The amenities that they offered were standard. We had to ask for an iron, but they brought one within minutes. Rooms were tidied daily. They also had a storage option which I used on checkout day. I left my bag with them in the morning and came back for it in the afternoon. While they offered everything that a hotel should, it was of the cheapest quality. The towels were rough and thin, as were the bedsheets. The blankets were the thin polyester variety and the mattress hard and uncomfortable. I expected this, considering the price that we were paying for the rooms, but I did find that after a long day of pounding the pavement, I never felt adequately rested.The Pod Hotel is a funky, interesting hotel that seems to be best suited to young travelers and those that are not looking for comfort.

I couldn't have chosen a better location if I tried. There were several subway stations right around every corner, the nearest being a 3 minute walk to the top of the street. Right around the corner from the Bliss day spa, 5th Avenue, Lexington Avenue, Times Square, literally all of the places that are of interest were all within easy reach; both by foot and the subway.2) ROOMS; I will be honest and say that the room was small, compact and cozy. We were staying in a bunk room with a shared bath, and managed to squeeze our cases down the side of the bunk, which freed up some space. There was minimal closet space, but enough to accommodate the two of us, and each of our 'going-out' outfits for the 6 night stay. Also, there was no issue with getting an iron from reception.The sink was small, but useful for washing our faces, brushing teeth etc. Its unusual to get this facility in a shared bathroom situation, but we were definitely grateful of it. There were plenty of soft white towels provided and replaced daily, tissues, glasses, toilet roll, hair dryer etc, basically all the little extras that we weren't expecting were provided which was excellent.The sleeping set-up was fun with the bunks, and i have to say that the beds were really comfortable, soft but supportive, and i relished getting into mine every night! Ive never had such a good sleep in any hotel before. Also, the TVs were a welcome extra for when we were just chilling out before getting ready to go out for the night.The view was great, we could see right out onto the street, and the windows had little white wooden shutters on them so that the light didn't wake you in the mornings. Heating and Air Con worked a treat. The only minor issue was the noise which didnt affect us greatly, just once or twice. It basically boiled down to the fact that the doors to each room slam shut, and so if someone goes to the toilet in the night, or is leaving really early in the morning, it can wake you up, but as i said, this happened once or twice. That combined with the small room size and for me, they are the only minor issues, but Im booking to go again, so this should tell you how much of an issue they actually were!3) SHARED BATHROOMS AND TOILET; My biggest worry was this factor of our stay. Previous encounters in other hotels with shared bathrooms had never been pleasant to say the least. All I can say is I was astounded! Gorgeous charcoal tiled floors, vanity mirror with soft lighting, luxurious rain-head shower with 2 separate jets on each side to spray your body, complimentary shampoo and shower gel in a pump fixed to the wall, which were always full and smelt delicious . Never once did they smell, never once were they dirty, never once was there no toilet roll, never once was i lift thinking Eugh! If thats not enough, every bathroom had really funky music at a level that was just right, kinda like chill out music, perfect! What i would say, is that just to be courteous, when taking a shower, make sure you put down the towel for when you step out so as not to soak the floor. There is a specific towel that your provided with for this purpose.4) STAFF: Not one problem to report. Check-In and out were both very smooth with no problems at all. Each member of staff that I encountered were polite and courteous. There were a couple of more 'laid-back' gentlemen behind the reception, but if your assertive, they soon get to whatever it is you need, so no problems at all.As I have said, for me this hotel ticks all of the boxes, and as long as the prices stay as low as they are then i will be staying here for every visit in the future. I know how rare it is to find such a brilliant hotel such as this one, particularly in New York. For that reason, I would urge you to give it a go, I guarantee you will not be disappointed!Heidi x :-)",Manchester,5,5.0

The showers were awesome, they all have shampoo and shower gel there already for you, so no need to haul your own. The bathrooms were never crowded, never a wait to pee. The room is small, but it's comfortable. There is a sink in the room, so no need to leave to wash your face. A TV and free wi-fi cannot be beat! The hotel staff was very nice. There are climate controls in the room - they are under the grate on the heater/AC - I found this on my second trip in June because it was SO HOT. If you leave it on, it cools the room and it's nice to come back to after a long day out exploring the city. There wasn't much of a problem with noise on either stay.

He was living in an apartment 4 blocks away but had no extra bed for me, so the location of the Pod was ideal. The hotel was cheap and clean, the staff kind and helpful. It was my first time traveling alone, but everyone was happy to answer my questions.I had a room for singles, and while it was extremely tiny, it was comfortable, modern and cute. The tv was adequate and the iPod speakers a pleasant surprise.The single rooms have shared bathrooms, and even though I expected to be disgusted by this detail (I have kind of high standards...), the toilets were clean and of high quality. The floor had 4 separate lockable bathrooms, each with a toilet, sink and shower. I never used the shower during my 7 day stay (showered at my friend's apartment instead), but I would have had no issues with doing it. In the room, there were lights over the door that indicated which bathrooms were available.In the beginning, I noticed that the room became chilling during the night, but eventually I found the AC-controls hidden below the windows, and were able to adjust them to something more comfortable.To be honest, my only complaint is that the nearest Starbucks is relatively far away. ;) This is however not enough to keep me from coming back, something I definitely will do.","Oslo, Norway",2,5.0

Due to this I knew that it would have been someone's job to search for the best hotel in New York for her trip, and after much research myself too found it the best deal. After reading many of the reviews on here I decided to book the largest double room which is the queen, due to everyone saying the others are rather cramped. It still wasn't particularly large, about average size for a room, but all you're doing is sleeping in it as you're out and about all the time, so it was great from that perspective.The hotel is extremely fresh, clean and rather funky, with the staff being very helpful and polite. Before I booked the hotel I emailed with quite a few questions, as it was for my 21st birthday and wanted everything to be perfect, and every single one was answered within a few hours with helpful advise too.The location is great, we actually walked everywhere apart from when we went the financial district. Times Square, the Rockefeller etc is about a 10-15min walk away in one direction and Central Park and Bloomingdales the same in the other direction.

I checked in, and dropped my stuff off in the room. The view sucked, but I figured I could live with it. I went out for the afternoon and came back, and I was freezing, and the room was freezing. I went to turn the heat on, and nothing happened. I read the hotel information book next to the bed, and it said that the heat on the second and third floors was ""centrally controlled"", and the heat on floors four and above could be individually controlled. I was on the third floor. I went down to the lobby to ask the woman at the desk if I could switch rooms. She asked if I had been in the room, I said yes. She said then no, I couldn't switch, because they would have to get someone to make up the room, and they didn't have anyone. I explained that I had been out all day, it's not like I had been living in the room. She asked if I had touched anything, and I said that I had used the bathroom and thrown something in the garbage. She was like, well then you've already used the room. I explained that I was freezing (one of those chills that gets in you and doesn't let go), and I wanted to control my own heat. She said that the heat throughout the entire hotel was centrally controlled. I said that wasn't what their information book said, and she said it was wrong. I explained that there was also an extremely loud pipe in the bathroom, and that I could hear every word of every conversation of the people in the rooms around me. I even looked out into the hallway a couple of times, because I thought there must be a bunch of people sitting right outside my door speaking loudly for there to be that much noise, but in fact it was just paper thin walls. The guys next to me were having a conversation, and I almost answered at one point, because I knew what the other guy wanted to know.  None of this did anything to help my case with this frosty front desk woman. She merely dismissed me and said she would send an engineer to the room to see if I knew how to turn my heat on. I turned away quickly, because she had been SO rude that I was starting to cry, and I didn't want to give here the satisfaction. The engineer came to my room, turned the switch to the ""on"" position, and said that I didn't know how to turn it on. I explained that I had in fact mustered up enough smarts to turn the switch to on, but no heat had come out. I asked him about the centrally controlled heat thing, and he said no, that I just turned the switch on when I wanted heat. I explained that's not what the hotel information book said, and he didn't believe me, he said I had read it wrong. I showed it to him, where it said that floors four and above could control their own heat, and he said, so it's just the second floor that can't do their own heat, you're on 3. I said, but the third floor is under the fourth floor, and he said no, just the second floor is below the fourth floor, whatever the hell that means! I asked him about the very loud pipe, and he said that was for the heat, and that's why it was so loud. What heat, I said! It's been loud the whole time! I left for the evening to see a Broadway show, ""Chicago"", very fun, and when I came back to the room, it was ice cold again. I called down to the desk, it was a young guy at this time of night. I explained that I had left my heat on, but now the room was freezing again. He told me that the heat for the entire hotel is centrally controlled, and that it cycles on for 20 minutes every hour. I asked what I do when it isn't that 20 minutes and I'm freezing, and he said I was out of luck. I seriously considered abandoning the hotel and looking for another place to stay, but I had prepaid, and figured I would end up paying a fortune if I just walked into a hotel looking for a room. This was an even bigger diappointment for me, considering how much I liked my quiet, pretty view, temperature controlled room (you CAN control your own air conditioning!) that I had last summer. I will definitely think twice about booking here again.","Windsor, Ontario",35,2.0

This service was excellent value and only cost $38 for 2 people which was great.We arrived about 3pm, there was no que at check in and we were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving. We paid using travellers cheques on check in.The lobby was modern, styish and spacious, around the corner was a large lounge/sitting area and a decked garden area outside. There was also a roof terrace which you could get to from the 14th floor.We were in room 231 on the 9th floor. The room was small, but there was under the bed storage and a place for hanging things and putting your cases. There was a desk and a bedside cabinet with an iPod dock/alarm clock which also worked with my boyfriends iPhone. The room was cleaned daily, with fresh towels etc. The bathroom was immaculate and the shower spacious, however a clear glass panel in front of the shower cubice, overlooking the bedroom meant that the room was not entirely suitable if you like privacy when showerin. however there was a frosted glass panel you could slide across, which would be ok. the sink area is in the main bed area, but there is a large surface and good mirror. The room also had a hairdryer, but not very powerful.We had a double pod which was fine for our needs and was more than comfortable for 1 week, but anyone tall may need to upgrade to a larger room.We saw a couple of the bunk rooms when we were there which also looked good and quite spacious. we also had a peak in the shared bathrooms which looked and always smelt clean!The concierge seemed very helpful and knowledgable, although we did not use his services.The location of The Pod was excellent, only a 15 min walk to Rockafeller Centre and 20 min to Times Sq/Central Park. Area also felt really safe, even after dark. The Pax Deli on the corner was a saviour. Lovely fresh food every morning and the guys working there were really pleasant.The hotel also had free wii fi, you just had to get the codes from reception. it worked really quick and was ideal for planning and researching what you were going to do the next day.Only one thing which some people may find annoying (we didn't) but you can hear quite a lot that is going on in the coridors and the doors do sometimes bang, but you have to remember that people who don't have a private bathroom may need to get up in the night to use the shared facilities.Overall we had a really great stay and would go back to the pod again and recommend it to our friends.","Newcastle, ENGLAND",47,4.0

However the night we arrived at the hotel it was gone midnight and the thought of unpacking and gathering my stuff to go to the shared bathrooms made me ask to be put into a double if they had one available. The guys on the reception desk were really helpful and arranged that for me and at the price my friend had booked some weeks earlier. Across the weekend we did check out the shared bathrooms and they were almost always vacant and spotless.The double rooms were really clean and their compact size to be expected. I really liked the fact that it had the functionality that was needed for this type of budget hotel which was to wash, change and sleep in. The noise that other reviewers mention was not an issue...quite frankly I was so knackered from all the walking we did everyday that I was out as soon as my head hit the pillow! The radiators on the lower floors are centrally controlled so it does get HOT so I slept with the window slightly open and even though I was on the 2nd floor facing the street it wasn't that noisy.

It certainly is a modern hotel with a funky room set up. The room was small, but intuitively set up and with more than enough space to move around. The mobile LCD tv on each bed was a brilliant idea as it allowed my fiance to watch his history channel whilst I caught up on my Hillary vs Obama reviews and American trash tv.The bathrooms are impeccable and frequently cleaned. There are indicators in the room to let you know when bathrooms are taken/available.Location: Pretty central. We were a 20minute walk from Times Square and there are places to eat all around. Absolutely recommend the French bistro next door (kitchen opens till 4am), and the Japanese place (Tanaka) a few doors down. The salmon sashimi was a great quality and the meal prices were good too.There's a shuttle service from the hotel to JFK, that takes about 30mins to get there, and will cost you about $20+pp. Cheaper than a taxi and ideal if you do stupid amounts of shopping like we did and cant be bothered dragging suitcases to the the subway.

It was a cheap n'cheerful 1* hotel in a great location so was interested in seeing the revamped Pod on a bonus side trip to NYC when again, decent hotel rooms were in short supply.Oh dear. The new lobby is a big improvement; the lifts have gotten a smart wooden veneer (but move at the same pace :-) and gone are the bakelite furnishings/TVs and old-fashioned room 'decor'. Best way to describe the revamped rooms is an upscale youth hostel with some innovative additions like rainhead showers and a very, very 'ecletic' muzak selection that there was no escaping from.Pros: I'm thinking hard because I have some very fond memories of previous Pickwick Arms stays ...Okay, location. Short distance to Lexington Avenue subway; easy walking distance *hollow laugh* to Central Park, Fifth Avenue, St Patricks Cathedral; Rockefeller Center; Radio City etc.Price: Very reasonable but as is sometimes the case, you gets what you pay for.Cons: The bed. Oh man. The single room was more like a cabin/cell/dorm size-wise. Knew that. But the new 'bed' .. it was terrible. Think a caravan bunk or a step up from a park bench - it's solid wooden base was designed for storage, NOT comfort when combined with a poor mattress and just a scratchy blanket and heavy-duty bed cover provided, (again, think caravan furnishings). Slept for the sum total of 2 hours on the first night trying to get comfortable; then the Industrial Strength Vacuam Symphony started in the hallways .. the doors slam as loudly as ever. It's not the guests fault, even if you hold the door while it closes it still slams.After two nights of backache, insomnia and muzak-overload, checked out early. When I mentioned the 'firm' bed to the desk clerk >shrug . ""Plenty of other people waiting for 'em'. Stack 'em and rack 'em, eh.

The Web booking was flawless, with speedy confirmations of the original reservation and a later change. We asked for nearby rooms and were given adjacent rooms on the eighth floor. Check-in was good, efficient and friendly. There is sometimes a wait of a few minutes for the two elevators servicing 12 floors, but it was never too bad.Our rooms cost $89 plus $15.40 in taxes for the single and $149 plus $23.43 in taxes for the queen, reserved online about a month in advance. The guests were, overwhelmingly, much closer to our son's age than to ours, but a wide range of ages, as well as countries, were represented. Lobby decor and attitude are definitely hip.The queen room was small but adequate, with a comfortable bed and plenty of storage space. We used the desk, but when someone is sitting at it there is no room for another person to get by. The bathroom was quite compact, but serviceable. The shower was small enough so that it took some doing to get outside of the flow from the oversized rainhead for a moment to soap up. The flat-screen TV was well located with good quality picture, perhaps not as many channels as in some hotels but plenty for us. We did not use the iPod docking station, but it's a nice amenity that I would use on another stay. We called the front desk immediately upon check-in to report that one of the two bedside lights was burned out, but a bulb never arrived. In the morning the heat was out for about 15 minutes but then came back on before we got cold. Everything was clean.Our son's single was like a nice dorm room. He liked the flat-screen TV. He tried the TV immediately on check-in and the remote did not work. He informed the hotel staff and new batteries were delivered within mintues. He told us that the wireless Internet access was good; you need to call the front desk for the access code. He could have used our private shower, but opted for the shower in one of the hall bathrooms. It was large and clean, with a rain-head nozzle and three side jets.I can see where the noise complaints come from. Contrary to some other reviews, there was no music piped into our hallway at night. But hallway conversations can be heard in the rooms, and some noise from other floors came in through the bathroom vent. There are the normal Manhattan street sounds. But we were in end rooms and the hotel was not too crowded, and it was overall a peaceful stay. I would, though, be concerned about the possible noise level on a weekend night with a full house. Other reviews cover in detail the fact that the Pod is in a prime location in Midtown East. There are many good nearby dining options. Our incredibly delicious birthday celebration dinner at Pampano (upscale Mexican seafood), two blocks away, cost about as much as the two rooms.I normally stay at the Omni Berkshire on business trips to NYC, so as much as I liked the Pod I could not bring myself to give it an Excellent rating. The Above Average rating, however, is testimony to the great value that it offers. I would gladly stay again, although I might hesitate on a weekend. My wife said that she would return to the Pod if she were ""in the right mood"" for it. I would not be surprised if our son were to visit the Pod with his friends on a weekend break from school in Philly. With two people in a bunk bed room it is a compelling value for college students.In sum, I am not quite ready to declare myself a Pod Person, but I'm getting there.","Washington, D.C.",13,4.0

We were able to check in a bit early and appreciated being able to stash our bags and hit the streets. Yes, it is small- even the rooms with private baths- but think cruise ship cabins and you won't be startled or disappointed. The design of the rooms and the facility is very smart and obviously someone has done their marketing homework, because they anticipated our every need and expectation.

We checked out the bunk bed rooms and the shared bathrooms- also immaculate. If you've ever used the public facilities at McDonalds, you will think the shared POD bathrooms are the Four Seasons. The housekeeping staff was constantly cleaning and checking them. The concierge was so very helpful and approachable- he didn't make you feel stupid or silly- and he had wonderful right on the money suggestions. Don't miss the Pax food shop nearly right next door- what a great selection of fresh edibles for every meal and taste. The French wine bar the other next door is good but the service is a bit ""I'm French and of course you're not""...check out their website for video from NY Eve that proves they do, in fact, rock out.

We felt lucky to get a room at the Pod Hotel and, if you are set on staying on Manhattan, then it's a good deal. However, it's recently renovated, and its previous incarnation was a really very poor standard budget hotel and, while the decor has been changed, the soundproofing most definitely hasn't. Many previous reviewers have mentioned the noise and, yes, it's pretty bad. The reception is nice, and the rooms - we were in a double with a bathroom - were fine, if small. The surrounding area is quiet; in fact, many nights, we slept with the window open because it was as hot as Hades in the room. The problem is that many rooms are 'budget' rooms without a bathroom. There's a great system with shared bathrooms, which isn't at all like hostel, but it means that all night people are coming and going, and the doors SLAM each time. After an early start and a late night and the effects of jet-lag, a poor night's sleep meant a day lost out of a four-day break in New York. The second day we got ear plugs and slept better, but the heat in the room made me feel like I might get malaria at any point. The area is not really near anything much to make it worthwhile and, if you have to stay on Manhattan, I'd suggest staying further up on the East Side or further downtown.

Eventually, to much relief I discovered the pod hotel with the bunk beds. Sure the room was small (how much time do you spend in your room in New York anyway?) but it was very well serviced and efficiently laid out. The bathroom was a little down the Hall but we had no problem in finding it empty and very clean when we wanted to use it . The doors did make a noise as you can't shut them quietly on the way out but this didn't really bother us as we only heard it in the morning. The location was excellent, a few minutes to the subway and about a 10/15 minute walk to Times square. Security in the Hotel seemed good and the neighbourhood felt very safe strolling around at night. Several good cafes existed for breakfast nearby. To cap it all the view from the hotel roof top is stunning especially at night. Well recommended.",London,40,4.0

The little stainless steel sink was handy. The overall atmosphere at the Pod was young and invigorating, which I absolutely loved, and I saw many older and even elderly people in the elevators, quite a mix.

I asked if other residents have complained, they said they've gotten some complaints in the past six months. I asked him if he thought music a 3am in the morning made sense, and he agreed it didn't. I spoke to the manager about it the next day, and his solution was to offer me $25 and give me a very condescending lecture about wearing earmuffs because I was a light sleeper. Needless to say, I declined his offer and countered that I would write about it here instead. Did not sleep a wink last night.

We (couple in our late twenties) stayed at The Pod Hotel in NYC for 5 nights (8th Nov - 13th Nov).Arrived at around 10.30pm Thursday evening from JFK (highly recommend taking a taxi/shuttle service) ... only around $US18 - $US20. Check-in lasted less than 2 minutes. Very swift indeed. We pre-booked a bunk bed pod (decided to opt out on the twin room and save the cash on shopping). Our room (1420) was on the 14th floor (highest) and faced out from the back of the building. We couldn't have been more pleased with what we got! Having stayed in many hotels and hostels around the world, our expectations were fair, however the Pod exceeded what we had been expecting. The bunk beds were great, heaps of room for each person, comfortable beds (I'm fussy) and each of us had an LCD tv that was mounted on a bracket in the middle of the bed. If you have never visited New York City before, we can tell you that you will hardly be in your room at all. We also had a heater/aircon under the window (room was warm enough and we didn't need it, infact we had the window open slightly each night), basin was handy to grab cold water and wash/clean teeth. We had a desk next to the bunks, with iPod dock (nice feature if you have a iPod), welcome book and notepad/pen. An open wardrobe was on the right as you enter the room. We hung most of our clothes on the 15 or so hangers provided. A keycode safe was built into the wall that was well used to store laptop, money, passports etc each day/night. The maid service was top-notch. We couldn't fault the lovely workers at The Pod Hotel. Each morning the maid-service would begin changing/cleaning rooms from around 9am. Clean towels, mats for shower and face washers were provided in our room each day. The beds were made with fresh sheets each day which added a nice touch after touring the city all day! The showers were communal on our floor (well for the unlucky ones without showers in their rooms). Didn't have a problem at all. Roomy, well lit, quiet music playing in the background when used. Huge shower head, temperature controled, good flow, and cleaned a few times a day. Each room in on the floor has an indicator showing what bathrooms are in use or available - a nice touch and saves walking ina nd out all the time. Doors make a little noise as they are weighted, I have read some people complaining about this, but you get use to it, and bung in some ear-plugs if you are a really light sleeper. However once you get use to the NY traffic you won't notice a thing. Tip: The concierge had a printout over several pages of recommended places to eat around the area and the city. We only noticed this on the second last day and would have made more use of the suggestions if we had it earlier.As you come out of The Pod, turn left, walk to the end of the street and you shall find Pax. Great coffee, soups, sandwiches, salad barn Great selection of fresh fruits, salads, warm food, soups, drinks etc.Getting back to JFK we pre-booked at the hotel for a shuttle bus. Was only $20 each and convienent. We didn't want to carry our luggage on the subway during peak hours. NYC taxi's are aplenty! Easy to hail one and very cheap. We caught the subway 4/5 times and even though it's old, it takes you to where you want very quickly. I'm rambling on now, so if you got this far, we highly recommend The Pod Hotel and would certainly stay with them again when we visit again ... oh we are planning to come back very soon.

We had originally booked a bunk room at the hotel but I had been ill the week leading up to the hol and still wasn't feeling 100% so we decided to upgrade our room. The bunk room was very, very small... fine if you literally want somewhere to crash at the end of the day but no good if you fancy a relaxing evening in.We asked to look at a double room. This was also very small, fine if you are with a partner but not so ideal for friends, the bed was tiny! We then moved on to the queen which was ideal, although this was nearly double the price. However, when actually allocated a room we were given a different one to the one we had viewed which was much smaller!! We went back down to reception and asked for the one we had viewed and they did gladly oblige. If your room seems small it may be worth asking to view others....The room (216) was great, big bed, flatscreen TV... walk-in shower (our shower also had a curtain across and was not in view of the 'glass door' which seems to be a problem in some pods). The only downside was the noise. We were right by the lifts and there was no problem with this and I didn't hear any guests chatting or the maids... but something with the plumbing was very wrong. I've never heard anything like it in a hotel... we had clanging pipe noise throughtout the night and it really was very loud!!The hotel itself is very nice and clean. We found the staff to be most helpful. We had a late flight on our departure date and they actually check your bags in a locked room which was reassuring. They also arranged a shuttle service to take us to the airport for $20 each which was great value for door-to-door service. The location is great for the price and there are some lovely restaurants and little bars close by. I would recommend this hotel but would suggest looking at a number of rooms if not satisfied and just be prepared for some noise!!",Sheffield,1,4.0

My wife and I stayed at the Pod for 4 nights in March '07. Our room was at the rear,away from the street, an upper floor. Tiny room, but clean and overallsuitable, since we're not coming to NY to hang out in the room. We found that the noise factor - from within the hotel, not from NYC!- was significant. To be fair, we are light sleepers, so if you sleep like a douglas fir, this won't be an issue. And although our trip was during spring break, we didn't see or hear any kids in the hotel. The walls are paper-thin and the hallways are narrow and provide little dampening effect when people talk or open/shut doors - in fact,the halls seemed to enhance volume, as we could hear people talking quite far away on the same floor. Sound seemed to creep in everywhere,as if there was no insulation. The issue is keenest if it happens thatyour neighbors right across or next to your room enter or leave theirsvery late or very early. People being people, most don't think to adjust behaviour to suit the conditions, so you get to hear all about their adventures and flight details while they stand in the hall gabbing and guffawing at 2am. Noise also included the elevator doors, even though they were fairly distant and around the corner of the hallway. The coup de grace was that whenever the guest across the halltook a shower, the sound came through our bathroom vent. Sigh... At least there wasn't a problem with noise coming from floors above or below - probably due to the concrete dividing them. We made the best of it, but the bitter irony was that, given our room's location, NY itself wasn't noisy - it was the interior of our hotel.A second problem, which may have changed, is that we found the staff Indifferent. This cropped up all the time, starting with check in, asking for directions (to anything), getting help storing bags, etc. We had the impression that they hadn't been very well trained in the hospitality biz. Nothing extreme, but the tone just didn't feel, well,hospitable. There was a contrast between the chic and lively sensibility of the hotel's interior design and the ho-hum attitude of its staff. We could have lived with that, as the Pod is clean and reasonably priced for NY, but the noise was the deal breaker - even with ear plugs.","Toronto, Canada",1,2.0

We were quoted one price on the website but when we confirmed our booking by email the price was greatly inflated. We pointed this out to the staff who rudely told us that we and their very own website were wrong! Nevertheless, the price was still competitive for NYC and on friends' recommendations, we booked regardless.Great location: only 5 mins walk from Fifth Ave and 15 mins to Times Sq. Closest subway is E51st & Lex (2 mins walk). Clean, modern room of good size with flat screen TV (stayed in en suite Queen room for 7 nights) and ipod docker. Room was a bit bare and rather dark, particularly the bathroom. Awful synthetic fleece-like blankets but otherwise comfortable bed. Heating in the room ran on on 20 min cycle over which we had no control. Bathroom was clean with modern decor but shower lacked pressure. Biggest potential problem is the glass wall separating shower and bedroom meaning little is left to the imagination! Fine for couples but probably less so if travelling with friends, however, not sure if this is a feature exclusive to double rooms. Communal bathrooms looked fine but bring your own towels as the ones provided were the size of postage stamps - a particular problem as bathrooms are positioned next to the lifts!Modern, funky lobby not in keeping with the slow, dated lifts/elevators, dark corridors and scruffy staff uniforms. Very helpful concierge - you get discount on helicopter rides but theatre tickets are cheaper direct. Roof terrace would be great in Summer. All in all, The Pod is good value for NYC but not for anywhere else in the world. It is a good base (well located, clean and modern) but nothing more.

We had 3 large suitcases with us, and got enough space to all of them. The bathroom was tiny, but adequate and clean. It took several minutes before we got hot water, but we stayed at the 11th floor viewing the street. Our friends on the same floor got hot water right away, but we never bother to adress this to the front desk. We did however wonder if we had gotten a double room since it said on Pod's web page that queen size room should have a 20"" tv, but we only got a 15"". No biggy, since we just watched the weather reports in the morning. The location is good, not too far from the subway and easy to get breakfast nearby. We stayed downtown last year, but liked this location much better.

However, we managed it throughout our stay.One thing we noticed that, the cleaner always start cleaning at 7a.m., and because of the size of our room, we can hear the noise from people next door (talking, walking, if they use the shower and etc) o! Hence, we did not sleep well suring our stay in the hotel.During my last stay, we had to get up early to catch our flight at 8a.m., hence when we were leaving the room to the reception to check out, I asked the receptionist if anyone can help us to bring our luggages down to the lobby, and he replied saying he was the only one on duty, and there was no one to help. My friend and I had to just bring our luggages down in turn as the lift do not fit in all the luggages!Hence, my conclusion is that, if you leave in the early of morning, don't expect anyone from the hotel to help out with anything.

Whilst finding good value in Los Angeles was simple, it was a little harder in New York. Eventually, we stumbled across the Pod Hotel at Expedia.co.uk and booked one of the rooms with bunk beds and a shared bathroom at a cost of around GBP85 per night (inclusive of taxes).The hotel was relatively easy to find and I really liked the way that everything about this particular accommodation was so different to any other hotel I have ever stayed at; huge, trendy artwork on the walls, modern furnishings and an area to relax, where other guests sat eating takeaways. I don't know of any other hotels that would tolerate this!Checking in at midday was not a problem, even though the usual time is 2.00pm and we were quickly given key cards to room 219 on the second floor.We found our way to the room without any problems. I was surprised by the size of it and by the presence of a wash basin. I was expecting a small room but this was actually slightly larger than I imagined it would be. There were two bunk-beds, each with a flat-screen television, a desk and chair. On the desk was a telephone and an ipod docking station. The window served no purpose other than to let in light. It didn't offer any views.The location of the hotel was also much better than expected, just a 2 minute walk from the 51st Street subway station on Lexington Avenue, or a few minutes more from Grand Central Station, which was only two stops from Times Square.What I liked about the hotel was that it was exactly that - a hotel, offering a bed and not much more. I wanted somewhere to sleep and not a fancy/overpriced restaurant and bar, extortionate room service and expensive on-demand movies in the room. In fact, when coming to check out, there was not a bill to pay. Even toll-free calls are not charged for, unlike many other hotels.A status panel in the room shows which of the four bathrooms on each floor are occupied. I never incurred a wait when wanting to use the bathroom and everytime they were clean and fully-stocked with toilet paper, hand-soap, shower gel and shampoo. Rooms were visited by a maid daily, with a fresh stash of towels and bottled toiletries to take to the bathroom. The bathrooms themselves were of a good enough size, with a great shower at one end, a toilet at the other, and a wash-basin in between. They were tiled black and white. Modern piped music played in each of the bathrooms and the corridors.The person I was travelling with complained that our room was too hot and that night-time was noisy. Firstly, the room was hot, but we did have access to the heating controls. Since we didn't know how to use the controls and didn't bother to ask for help, we only had ourselves to blame for this. As for the noisy nights, I slept like a log on both of the two nights that we were there.Upon checkout, we asked if we could leave our bags at the hotel, as our flight home was not until much later at night. Our four bags were secured in a storage room and tickets were issued. At the same time, we also asked that a taxi be arranged for us. The cost to JFK was the standard $45, although we weren't expecting the big, black, stretched limousine that turned up! Definitely a great end to a great trip.This hotel is suitable for all, that is assuming you're not after more than a bed. If you want a friendly, efficient service, and spotless accommodation, then this hotel is a must.

Based on the reviews of the hotel, I was not expecting anything glamorous; rather I expected a small and clean room. I was not disappointed as the room itself came as advertised. I had a queen bed with an in-room bathroom (awkwardly placed toilet, small stainless sink with an unfortunately placed/designed faucet, very small shower stall) that was sparsely decorated. The doors to the hallway did not seem to keep out noise from outside which normally may not have been a problem, but during my stay was (see below). I appreciated the location which was 1 ½ blocks from the subway and close to the major thoroughfares, 1 block from a police precinct headquarters.However, the problems I had with the hotel mostly related to the service and the other guests who stayed at the hotel. When I walked into the lobby of the hotel the first night (and the subsequent nights that I returned), I was nearly overwhelmed by the number of teenagers talking loudly and lounging throughout. The night I arrived I had to request three times (at the desk and on via the phone) for an ironing board and iron be sent to my room. Once the board arrived (a small table top version), I had difficulty setting it up as the feet were both broken. On the first two nights of my stay, the hallways were loud with guests running up and down the halls, slamming doors, playing soccer and yelling to one another. One night this commotion went on until nearly midnight. I spoke to a desk manager about the issue and he told me that they had left messages with the teens’ chaperones, but that there was nothing that they could do about their guests’ behavior. I understand that this hotel is reasonably priced, especially for Midtown Manhattan, but guests should know that this will also attract students and groups, many of whom don’t necessary share an understanding of acceptable hotel behavior. As the hotel felt more like a trendy European hostel than a grown-up hotel, and I do not want to take the chance of being kept up by the hotel’s guests, I do not think I will stay at the hotel again.

This did not bother me as they were kept extremly clean and the funky modern design of the room was very efficient.The location was great, there was a wonderful Tapas bar next door, called divine (I think) - Great food, wine and ambience to be had in there.

It is also close to the Green line on the underground/subway which can be used to get to other places a bit further away.From the airport is very easy to just get a shuttle bus which will cost you $21 (plus tip as always) which is quick and efficient.The room was small, but that was expected after the reviews, and given the fact that you won't spend much time in the hotel it is not a big deal. There is an iPod deck in the room, as well as a nice LCD television mounted on the wall.Storage seemed to be present although I did not use it as I just lived out of my suitcase as I always do.The room was clean when I arrived and was nicely cleaned everyday.In terms of things to do in New York, there are lots to do. I would advise going on the greyline bus which will take you to all the sites and is a standard hop-on-hop-off bus, although I had to correct the bus narrator on three things he said which were not true including the outrageous statement that Columbia University has the most amount of Nobel Prize winners. When I corrected him, he said that he has to please the Americans on the bus, well he did not please the English people on the bus.The one disappointing attraction was the Empire State Building, far too touristy, long queues and a worse view that The Rockerfellar in my opinion, also from the Rockerfellar you can see the Empire State!!!Overall New York was very nice and the hotel was as expected thanks to all the great reviews on this site.","Melbourne, Australia",23,5.0

It was totally redone about a year ago. Conceptually, it's great. But it has many annoying flaws that need to be addressed if I am going to return:1) The room doors make a great deal of noise when opened and closed. This could be fixed easily. I can't imagine other people don't find the noise as jarring as I do. Management--get off your duff and address this.2) Sheets/mattresses--not sure why, but the sheets are slightly too large for the mattress, and if you toss and turn more than once, the bedsheets come loose and before you know it you're stuck in mass of bedding. Very annoying, and again, not too difficult to figure out and fix.3) Internet service--very erratic. Sometimes fine, sometimes poor. My room, at the end of a hallway, didn't receive a signal from the network, even with a booster lent by the hotel. So, I had to go down and sit in the lobby to use my computer. Even in the lobby, the network comes and goes. The hotel suggested it was my computer--not. I could pick up lots of people's personal networks in nearby apartments.

We had a bunk-bed room with shared bathrooms down the hall. We found the hotel to be in a nice, safe neighborhood with several good breakfast options around the corner. Plus there is a beautiful little park with a waterfall across the street.Our room was very small, but just right for the two of us. We didn't have a lot of stuff. The room was very well thought-out. We had individual flat screen tvs, a phone, radio, sink and hangers. The bathrooms down the hall were always clean and we never had to wait to use one. The only downside to the bathrooms, to us, were the rainhead showers. We've never experienced those before and I found them odd. The water comes out straight over you so if are using conditioner, you have to turn the water off (saves water anyway) or step out of the way for a moment before you rinse. There was always plenty of hot water and good pressure. Our room was on the 12th floor. Our beds were comfortable.Our room had great views (#1218) and only two floors up to the roof deck which was really nice at night. We never smelled any smoke. The airconditioning in our room worked well and wasn't too loud. The windows in the room opened too but there was no screen. There were no bugs but there was evidence of pigeons!Our only complaint is the locking mechanism on the door. While inside the room, you can quiety open and close the door. However, from the outside, you can not close the door quietly. This is hard to explain. But because of this, if you go to the bathroom, or just leave your room, you make a loud noise closing the door. This isn't a problem unless you are asleep. So what ended up happening is that we got up when all our neighbors got up or when the door noises just kind of got to you! But fortunately, we were never woken up late into the night - it was at a reasonable hour.One very nice feature of this hotel was that it has an earlier check-in time and later check-out than many hotels. Check-in was at 2 pm and check out was 12 pm. The 12 pm check-out gave us a little extra time in the morning to do some morning sight-seeing before heading out. We found the staff quite helpful and elevators seemed completely normal to us. It's just that there are only two elevators for 14 floors so do expect to wait a few minutes.One last thing, we think we may have been some of the very few Americans staying here.

Our room (the ""Bunk Pod"" - a twin with bunkbeds) was extremely small (which made packing on check-out day a bit awkward; in fact, one of us had to leave the room to enable the other one enough space to move around the room to pack) but we did expect that. However in the room we found everything we needed - a small desk, iPod docking station/alarm clock , flat screen TVs, toiletries, towels and face cloths and hairdryer. Despite our advance misgivings about shared bathrooms, we found during our stay that the bathrooms were extremely clean and in excellent condition (although also quite small and lacking shelves, hooks on walls and hand-drying facilities). There were 4 bathrooms per floor and this number seemed adequate - one bathroom was larger than the others and had a window and this was the one I ended up using all the time.The reception area and outdoor deck/terrace looked fantastic and very welcoming. The roof terrace on the 14th floor was also a great place for quiet time. The hotel also produces a regularly-updated list of suggested diners, restaurants and shops/stores, both in the local area and elsewhere in Manhattan, which proved very useful. A few negative comments however:1. The air conditioning in the room was extremely noisy so we ended up sleeping with the windows open (as our room overlooked the street below, traffic noises woke us up in the morning but this did not bother us). 2. There were no hand-drying facilities in the bathrooms, no shelves around the sink and also nowhere to hang things/clothes so I ended up piling up my clothes on top of the toilet.3. The light panel in our room designed to indicate which bathrooms were free did not function so we had to open our door to check which bathrooms were free and which were not. Thankfully from our door we could survey all 4 of them.4. The lifts - horrendously slow and often full when they got to our floor. We ended up using the stairs a lot - thankfully we were only on the 4th floor.5. We would have appreciated operating instructions to use the iPod docking station/clock radio.6. There were no signs giving directions to the roof terrace (you must make your way to 14th floor, and from there find staircase B, and walk up one flight of stairs).6. The roof terrace itself lacked decent lighting at night - one area of the roof, round the back but easily accessible, lacked any safety rails and anyone could have fallen off the roof very easily. Finally I recommend that if you intend to come you bring some flip flops (to use in the bathroom as the floors can sometimes be wet if someone has had a shower just before you), and some headphones if you are sharing a room and both intend to watch different channels on TV.In short I have no major complaints about this hotel and would recommend it to anyone looking for tasteful and convenient budget accommodation. I would happily stay there again.","Brighton, United Kingdom",138,4.0

We reserved through the hotel web page; reservation process requires a credit card number but payment is done at the check out moment. We stayed there 6 nights in a double bunk room, where each bed had its own LCD screen, a window, a little closet and an ipod station. The room is not so big but, anyway, we stayed in the hotel just to have a rest or during the night… too many things to see in NY. There was no bathroom inside this kind of room but a display was indicating shared bathroom availability. Shared bathroom were very clean and really nice, with streaming music and a very relaxing atmosphere given by the granite interiors. Free Wi-FI internet was available in the room. At the 14th floor there is a nice terrace to be tried mainly during the night.Price was OK if we consider NY standards and people working there have been always very kind.

The decor is very clean with modern lighting and furniture. There is an area off of the lobby where you can sit outside to surf the net, meet up with friends or eat a take out meal. It's better than sitting in your room if it's a nice day!! You could also enjoy some outdoor time on the rooftop patio, which has fabulous views of the surrounding skyscrapers (most notably the Citibank building).I loved my room - although travelling alone, I chose the twin bunk bed room which was only $10.00 more than a single room, and it allowed me extra space to spread out all my stuff. The shared baths were also no problem. I was able to get one whenever I needed it, and they were always well maintained and clean.The surrounding area has everything I needed. The hotel was close to several subway stations which took me anywhere I wanted to go. For a quick breakfast I went to Pax Wholesome Foods which was just down the street at E 51st and 3rd - I really enjoyed the coffee as well (I'm not the Starbucks type). And if you need a few minutes to relax and unwind, there's a little parkette just across the street from the hotel with a cascading waterfall that drowns out all the noise of the city. Loved it!!!All in all, The Pod Hotel is a great place to stay and I will stay there again on my next trip to New York City. I would definitely recommend The Pod Hotel to friends and family looking for a good location in New York City with affordable rates.","Toronto, Canada",6,5.0

Unless you don't mind showering or peeing in front of people then you may find it rather awkward. The ""double"" bed was not of the usual size of a double bed which may again be awkward especially if you are quite tall, your legs would just dangle off the edge of the bed. We checked out the bunk bedded rooms and they were a lot bigger, plus the shared bathrooms were spotless so well worth considering. Although I do have to point out that the room we stayed in as well as the hotel lobby etc was spotless and very well maintained.The location of where the Pod is - EXCELLENT. A short stroll to the shops on 5th Avenue, close to restaurants, tube station, internet cafes. Central Park is about a 40 minute stroll away which was pleasant (but very hot of course in the middle of August)Last but not least, the staff at the Pod were very nice and were on hand to recommend some clubs for us to try so thank you to Luis (I think).

If you imagine Apple and IKEA getting together to form a hotel, this would be it. This is NOT a luxury place. It's modern, hip and clean, but small. The offered free internet service and a clock radio with an ipod hookup. It was comfortable, but small. It was clean, but small. It was relatively quiet, but small. Actually, for new york, where the trash trucks love to bang metal garbage bins at 3am and sirens never seem to stop, it was pretty quiet. The air worked, the windows opened. I had a bathroom in my room which makes it more expensive, but I did check out the 'public' bathrooms and they were modern and clean and it's not like you're going to be in a moldy, slimey bathroom. I guess you can save some dough if you're okay with sharing a bathroom with others. The in-room bath was.... small. The shower was fine with a big, over-sized shower head. This is great for single travelers or for two people who are packing light. Let me say once more, this room is SMALL. There is a small desk area that you can use to put your suitcase on, but that's about it. A small closet area to hang some clothes. The sink area reminded me of an airline bathroom. stainless steel sink.... small..... splashes everywhere. But I liked this place! Had a small flat screen tv. It was fine! It's definitely a 'hip' place. And there is an airport van service that stops there. You need to make a reservation in the lobby during working hours, so don't wait till the last day. It took about 45 minutes to get to La Guardia. one last thing.... it's a short walk to the subway line. And maybe a 15 minute walk straight down 51st to the theater district. All the streets around there are pretty active, and night walking shouldn't seem 'unsafe'. But use your head if it's really late.

I have included below reviews from both stays for more information. New Years: Scanning around as we were late in the game of booking a room prior to New Years I was elated when I called up the Pick Wick Arms (Now the Pod Hotel) which had not only space but appeared to be a vibrant young and modern hotel with a great price tag. My family member whose first time it was in the city and my 2nd stayed there for our 2 nights/3 days in the city. Within walking distance of many landmarks, within a 25 minute walking radius of the hotel we visited: * Central Park * Rockefeller Center * Nintendo World store * NBA store * Times Square * The world's largest toy store- Toys'R Us Times Square * 5th Avenue * Avenue of the Americas  The rooms are very reasonably priced and actually amazing price tags when you think that this is in Midtown East, sporting some of the highest room rates on earth typically ranging anywhere from $400-600. The Pod Hotel for 2 nights including extravagantly popular night of December 31st was $179 for the double room with private bathroom. The room was very comfortable and modern with a spacious desk, flat screen LCD television, a marble shower & bathroom with nifty holders. A note on the public bathrooms for the single & bunk bed room guests, they are also pristine and even have music in the shower and plenty of shampoo & soap in dispensers. We actually used one of these bathrooms also in the morning so we could shower faster which I suggest as they are usually mostly empty. It saves time so you have more time to get out into this magnificent city!  Beautiful British bath products are provided in abundance by the maids whom are very friendly and clean the rooms spotlessly. We had a question about whether we could turn the television so went out into the hall and asked a maid there, she happily came in and showed us how. A small interesting note, they are in the traditional French maid outfits, not something you often see! Summer 2007: I returned to the Pod Hotel in July for a 2 night stay again and had an equally wonderful experience with them. Now that the renovations are complete with the hotel, there is a concierge desk that is staffed most of the day, a cozy lounging area with modern furniture and a rooftop garden, however I didn't get a chance to go up there, next time for sure. There is also a outdoor deck area which I did go out on and enjoyed. This time I had several requests of the front desk and each call or whenever I went up to the desk I was greeted with friendly staff who cater to you. I stayed in the double room again, and though the same as the summer I did notice that there are now two glass doors for the bathroom which makes it easier for privacy. Also I read in an earlier review of The Pod Hotel that there was this beautiful quaint park down the street (East 51st Street) that the Pod Hotel is on. I found it just across the street down a 2 minute walk from the hotel. It's called Greenacre Park and was built by a wealthy New Yorker for the simple purpose of proving a paradise in the middle of bustling midtown Manhattan. Just a few blocks from Times Square as a New Yorker whom I sat beside said and yet such serenity. The park has a raised terrace covered eating area, a spacious stone patio with modern wire cafe style chairs & tables. A snack bar offers a wide variety of gourmet food not just snacks freshly prepared by the friendly Asian owner. I enjoyed a delicious croissant & fruit salad in front of the crowning feature a large waterfall at the back of the park! A visit to this park is a must! To add to the list of nearby attractions and places this time from the hotel I walked to:   * Top of The Rock observation deck at the GE Building (also contains the NBC store & tour, Rainbow Room)  * Theater District * Maddame Tsusauds (also a ticket office for CitySightsNY Hop on Off buses & the start for their downtown tour)  * The world's largest toy store- Toys'R Us Times Square & other theme stores  * Grand Central Station & its shoppes I readily reccomend the Pod Hotel to friends and family and will surely be returning!","Ontario, Canada",6,5.0

The neighbourhood it nestles in is kind of cute, right in the middle of a lot of United Nations representatives' residence. It feels like a safe neighbourhood, close to a few cute restaurants on 2nd.

I am returning next weekend because how much I liked this hotel. I was looking for something inexpensive since I was going by myself. All I basically was looking for was a clean room to sleep in. When Im in NYC I spend as much time in the city and NOT in my hotel room so this was perfect. The shared bath was clean and always available. I would just suggest to take a washcloth or buff with you because there is liquid soap in the shower and if you like to lather up you will need it, I also got a pair of cheap flip flops for 99 cents so I could just throw them away and not take them home. You should have them for the shower. And the shower head was better than some at better hotels!Room was small but clean with just enough space for me to move around. Again all I needed it for was to sleep and sleep I did as soon as I got back and hit the pillow. Was comfortable with the bed. I felt safe walking to the hotel every night and it is about 20-25 minute walk form Times Square. Next time I may try the subway. The maids were friendly and actually talked to me which never usually happens at other hotels I stayed in. The rooms do not have a iron but they will bring you one up to your room if needed.Went up to the top to check the view and glad I did. It was awesome and plan to go back up and relax or eat while enjoying the view.I am older than most of the people I saw there. Thats ok again I didnt spend much time in it. The hallways are narrow so alot of times you would hear the doors slamming. But I got use to it. The doors slamming was my wake up call in the morning! I actually rather that than then the dreaded alarm clock!I got a great package deal thru Expedia. When I go in Sept (next week) I got a better price on the room by calling them directly then what was on their website and on Expedia. The women who booked my room was very nice and was surprised that it was cheaper booking thru her (I was looking at the website while talking to her) I saved an additional $20-30.Also by staying at this hotel and walking down to Times Square I ran into a fair they were having on Lexington. I forgot to check what was going on in NYC before I left so I would have missed this (great food) So I checked this time and there will be another one the next time I am there. So you may want to check that out too before you arrive so you will have something else to do while you in the city. (google New York City Fairs). Lexington Ave. is not to far from this hotel.Took AIrlink to and from the hotel from LaGuardia and it cost me $31 round trip. Booked online round trip and got a discount. Just saw a discount coupon that I could have used to get it even cheaper. Book the shared van to get dropped off at the hotel. If you have a 2-4 I would suggest Carmel car service which would come out cheaper per person, and pay cash and use a coupon if you can find one online and use coupons for the return (they are in the NYC guide books).

Bathroom showerhead was great, very powerful. The hotel has no amenities though so it's really only a place for sleeping. Good location and very close to Subway. Only minor point to note is that it's a young person's hotel and the corridors did get rowdy at some points.

The decor of the nasty elevators was just the begining!! Our first night we stayed in their studio apartment. DO NOT RESERVE THE STUDIOS!!!! While it was nice that we could fit 5 people in their the overall decor resembled a home for the elderly and in no way looked anythign like the Pod Hotels Website. In my mind they were a bit untruthfull when reserving us this room over the phone by not telling us that it was not located within their hotel and was actually another hotel with old nasty beds and decor. So.... we checked outta that room and just gotta a nice queen sized room for me and my girl. The room had potential although a bit small. Then we walked in, saw water bugz on the floor and a huge white stain on the floor. The bed lights didn't work and when we returned with some champagne and drinks there was no ice machine and or bar in this hotel. I don't understand, even [--] motels i have stayed at have ice machines.I spoke with management and got very littel compensation, they managed to give me $50 off my bill and only because i showed them close up pics of the bugz.I have stayed in hotels all over NYC and the world and I can say that I will never stay here again. There are many hotels in NYC at the same price with better accomadations and I am sure NIcer Staffs. Ps.

We were able to leave our luggage in a special room for the day because are rooms would be ready by 2p.m. That was fine. Not a surprise cause I already knew that was to be expected. After that we went out site seeing:) Top of the Rock first stop:) at the Rockefeller center. Ya gotta go! Better view than Empire most def.:) Soon it was 2 p.m. We checked into our Townhouse suite room. The room had two twin beds and a sofa bed. Just right for us 4:) The room was not as modern as the other rooms featured on the site, but unlike others that have reviewed about the townhouse room and were disappointed we knew what was expected. The room was nice and comfy for us. We were completely satisfied. The room wasn't all to big but just right. We were able to get around the room comfortably and also enough space for luggage for us 4.The only problem was that I wish the bathroom shower head was a lil stronger. Maybe down the line they will upgrade the townhouse rooms which would be nice. But for now it was fine. Our stay at the Pod was a pleasant one.

When we expressed our surprise to the clerk, he was unhelpful and even claimed that our room had been renovated. I seriously doubt this as the furniture was broken (the queen bed) dirty (the chairs, rug and sofa) and non-existant (the ""optional rollaway bed"" which turned out to be a stained mattress, delivered in the evening after the clerks said they had never heard of this feature which is advertised as a ""Townhouse"" ammenity on their own website).The website also asserts the Townhouse bathroom has ""a luxurious rain-head shower and a stainless steel sink"", neither of which were true. The claim that ""Hotel amenities include a stylish lobby lounge, a world-class restaurant, and a beautiful rooftop garden bar"" is also only partly true; the lobby is nice, but there is no restaurant and the ""rooftop garden bar"" is a shabby roofdeck, made dangerous to navigate at night by the complete lack of any lighting. No sign of a bar anywhere.After entering the Pod Hotel's sleek and modern lobby, stepping into the ""suite"" side of the hotel was like stepping into an entirely different property.

I would suggest that my queen pod offered more 'space' than the last NY hotel I stayed in that I paid a room rate of $380 a night for!!!

The Pod Hotel is fantastic. Yes, the rooms are a little small but I didnt care- Im a student but I know that my family would stay here if they came. The Hotel is perfectly positioned in mid town manhattan. there are plenty of delis and restaurants near by. the subway is just 5 minutes away and it's within walking distance of the Chrysler building, Grand central station and 5th Avenue. What more could I add? I reserved the bunk room- which has no en suite. You could say it was an upmarket hostel... but it never felt like a hostel. It is truly a hotel. They have wonderful outdoor space for chilling around or eating food- around by the reception and upstairs on the roof top terrace! Our concierge was without a doubt one of the most helpful people ever. the staff are very friendly and will help you with any problems. the shared bathrooms are fantastic- clean and funky (thanks to the piped music!) I am definately coming back to New York and will definately stay at the Pod Hotel. If you don't want to break the bank and want to stay in manhattan- this is the place!* the only thing I would tell you to do is book a hotel shuttle bus before arriving. The hotel use Super Shuttle and it was $25 each way (plus tip)- bargain if you are going to JFK and dont want to take the subway!",Dublin,15,5.0

The rooms are small and basic, and we had to share two bathrooms with the second floor, but this was cleaned on a regular basis and treated with respect by guests. Basically, this is a good place to get some kip after a day exploring the greatest city in the world.

I'm glad I chose the Pod. I was in the city from July 30 - Aug 1 on my own so I knew I did not need a large room. My twin bed was the perfect size. I liked the fact that the room had a sink so I didn't have to go to a bathroom to brush my teeth or wash my hands. Housekeeping was provided daily with fresh towels. The bathrooms were very clean. I checked out 3 of them on my floor ( I was on the 5th floor). The showers were wonderful. I do have 2 minor complaints about the bathroom though. There were no paper towels or even paper towel dispensers in any of the bathrooms. I found this very strange b/c there was a soap dispenser by the sink. Weird and inconvenient. Also, I had to pull the doors with both hands to close it. It seemed as though the doors had swollen so they were very hard to close. Once I put the deadbolt on it was fine though. I read a few negative reviews about the front desk staff being rude. I never encountered this. The 2 gentleman that checked me in and out were friendly enough. The concierge was also very helpful in recommending lunch options for me. I highly recommend this hotel if you are only looking for a clean, safe place to sleep and shower while in NYC! I will be visiting again.","Columbus, Ohio",14,4.0

Rooms continue to be tight (this is Manhattan) but every square inch is well thought out and executed. The entire hotel was clean, staff friendly and helpful and you still can't beat the location.

We stayed in a double room with a shared bath. The hotel lobby is impressive, considering the price point of the facility. I was checked-in quickly with no problems. There isn't a restaurant but there is a soda machine in the lobby. I was prepared for the size of the room. It was quite small although it had a decent sized desk, sink and a small area to hang clothes. They really are small rooms though. I wouldn't stay at the Pod if you're the type of person who likes to relax in the room during a vacation or needs a lot of space. It worked fine for us though. There were four bathrooms on the floor and there was always at least one available. I would check out all of them though because one on our floor was much bigger and nicer than the other three. All in all, there were no issues with the shared bath. It actually saved time since my boyfriend and I could shower and get ready at the same time. The 14th floor roof terrace is great. There's a liquor store near the hotel and we would take wine up there for one last nightcap while we looked at the skyline. The location of the hotel is great, easy subway access and plenty of services on 2nd Avenue. I used the airport transport the hotel can book for you. It was $18 to LaGuardia and only took 30 minutes. You must reserve the day before. There's a stand in the lobby. I would definitely stay here again. The price really can't be beat and the hotel is new, clean and well located.","Denver, CO",23,4.0

Shared baths are something I have never done, but they were NICE, clean,large and I never had to wait. Wonderful shower heads.

I had read the reviews and looked at the hotel website so I knew the room was going to be small - which it was - but it was absolutely fine. It is like staying in Ikea - everything has it's place and it works really well. The i-pod docking station and flat screen tv on the wall was great too for a ""budget hotel"". It is certainly a hotel for people who are ermm ""comfortable with each other"" as the wall between the bedroom and the bathroom is see through glass. There are plenty of bathrooms on each floor though for people who require a little more privacy!! The shower in the room was powerful and really nice!The room was cleaned daily, the bed was made and fresh towels were put in. The air conditioning worked - thank goodness!! (New York was experiencing a heatwave when we were there, 41c!!). There was a bit of a wierd damp smell on the last night but we don't know if this was something to do with the air con or the bathroom??Make sure you go up the the top floor (14th?), right out of the lift and then left at the end of the corridor, through a door on the left and up the stairs. It isn't signposted but it goes to the rooftop terrace, which is good in the daylight and magical at night time.Location was fine - we didn't struggle for anywhere to eat (we didn't try the hotel's restuarant as it seemed a bit pricey). We didn't use the subway once, we walked everywhere and also had tickets for the sight seeing bus which took us down to Battery Park for the Staute of Liberty. If you don't mind walking a bit the location is excellent - it took about 20 mins to walk to the Empire State which isn't really a long time, and about the same for Bloomingdales.Overall, would recommend and it was better than I thought it would be! I was impressed!! If you're expecting to be waited on hand on foot in a huge lavish room then this isn't for you, but if you want to stay somewhere a bit different and quite funky, then stay at The Pod!","Southampton, United Kingdom",22,5.0

Obviously - I checked the website and was pretty impressed for the quality and price.However - I needed something comfy for 3 people. So I picked the townhouse studio from the Pod Hotel - pictures are not posted on the site. So obviously I expected the same style as the new rooms: modern and new. So - I reserved over the phone (prices are different on the website so it's best to call them)Finally the big day came - July 19th around 11pm. We arrive at the Pod Hotel: amazing lobby - very cute and clean..Even smells clean which is a big plus for me. Very kind people at the lobby too! Another plus. We check in. We arrive at our room: I was disappointed. The studio was spacious enough for 3 people and clean - but it was slightly renovated - which means it was pretty old. I went back to the lobby and requested to have a room change (since i didn't like the style and even told them they didn't post pictures on the site- they totally understood me). They told me to come back in the morning between 8-9am. The room again is spacious for the Townhouse Studio: 4 pple can stay and the bathroom is more ""private"" and there's a small walk in closet. There's a TV (not a flat screen) and a small fridge as well as a small safe.The next morning, I request to get a single and a queen bed room or separate rooms. The man at the lobby was able to find me a room for the three of us: the Veranda Pod. He told us to move our things into the new room and that the cleaning lady will prep up the room for us within an hour. So we proceeded to the room - left our things and the cleaning lady told us within a half hour the room would be done! We went out for breakfast and in less than an hour came back to have our room top notch clean! The room actually has a double bed and a twin bed. Features the I-pod dock and Flat screen TV... The shower and built in storage! Super comfy and not so so small. The best part: a small terrace with a nice view of the city. (try and get this room or your other pods between the 03-05-09 rooms... we stayed at the 1203 and great view!). The cleaning lady would come and clean everyday and vacuum...I also was curious to see what the shared bathrooms looked like: again I was impressed ! and I'm not exaggerating! Clean and modern!They had the roof terrace open all night. All i have to say is this is one amazing spot! Our stay for four nights cost 927$ and we split it by three: 310 each for four nights!!! That's amazing guys! I definately recommend this spot in town.You are close to a very cute private park and just a few blocks from Madison, and Lexington... I'd say about 10 min walk from Central Park!Any questions or places to go message me!!!I've also posted my candid shots!!!Enjoy it!I know I did and Im going back in October!Miau~","Montreal, Canada",3,5.0

Lots of good eateries nearby, as well as a grocery store and drugstore.We had a room with bunkbeds, and managed just fine with 7-days worth of clothes/luggage. The air conditioner worked beautifully, and the only noise we encountered were the slamming doors (easily remedied with earplugs).I was hesitant about the shared baths - I can't say that I'll do it again. I never had to wait, the rain showerhead was nice, but I can't believe how ""piggish"" some guests were - empty toilet paper rolls and wrappers were just thrown on the floor, the floor was flooded after some showers (I guess some people don't know the purpose of shower curtains), it was sad that a few ruined it for many. I'd definitely stay at the Pod again, but next time I'll splurge on a private bath.The lobby was wonderful - a cool refuge from the hot sun, a nice place to sit and listen to jazz and surf the Internet.

I chose a single room with shared bathroom and the availability of bathrooms was okay but there was a big difference in size and shower pressure on my floor so I opted for a favourite and stuck to that one. The staff were pleasant and knowledgeable. Only downside was the slow lift - it looks like the owners have retained a very old lift but given it a makeover - it took an age to reach the higher floors and was always full (6 people) when arriving to take me down.Overall I was delighted with my choice - value and functionality over luxury and comfort.

There is a lack of shelves around the sink or anywhere in the room but there are four hooks where you can hang makeup bags, clothes, towels, etc. The elevators were very hot but the rooms have air conditioning so it is not a big deal.The communal water closets should be cleaned more often. Unfortunately some people do not tidy up after themselves! Larger garbage cans might be helpful along with better shower curtains so there is not so much water on the floor. There are no paper towels or hand soap in the bathroom (although there is a pump) so you have to take your room towel and soap. A ""courtesy reminders"" sheet, hand soap in the pump, paper towels and an antibacterial spray available in the communal bathroom would be helpful. Remember to bring your shower shoes.

From this location we walked to the theatre district, Time Square, July 4 fireworks, Central Park, easily accessed the subway and found many wonderful restaurants and deli/salad bars in the area.Our cab from La Guardia to the hotel was $31 and that included the cab driver missing the hotel (??) and going around the block without turning off the meter!

Obviously, I knew before going that for the price (we did bunks) vs location and the 'budget concious' theme going on... that this would not be what I'm used to (no, it is not the W or Westin, or JW Marriott or Marquis...LOL), but here is what it was: The room was really cute/hip and the personal mini-flat screens were cool. Great location (we were able to walk to many major attractions...shopping on 5th Ave, Central Park , Union Station, Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, Radio City, etc....), a block or two away from the train(s) which were only minutes from Times Square...funny, I never realized how small the actual city was until I stayed in it!

And a bonus during our stay....Jose Cuervo was promoting their new premium tequila....we had complimentary drinks after a long day of touristy things and were able to jump-start a night on the town at no cost! Only a few things freaked me out a little: Our room was cold when we checked in due to the slow boiler and someone put their pizza trash in the bathroom trash can...yuck. But those were minor...the room actually did heat up after an hour or so (I think? We were out exploring so who knows when it came on) and the pizza in the bathroom, I just got over it....at least it was in the trash. The concierge was awesome, had maps, and great recommendations, but I only saw him once out of the entire 3 day visit. And lastly, my friend and I thought it a bit odd that an inner-city hotel did not have secured access for guests or a guard of some sort. at or near the entrance. Anyone can walk off the street and access any part of the hotel! Creepy.....but there is at least constant traffic in the lobby and someone was always at the front desk.....not much for security, but helped that someone might see anything a little weird. All in all, I'd probably stay there again if I were making a quick trip and wanted to be budget concious.","Richmond, VA",4,4.0

Stayed in the bunk bed arrangement with my sister- perfectly fine, although some kind of bureau drawers would've been nice. But having a sink in the room was great, and since we had brought our headphones, we were each able to watch our own tv without disturbing one another. Another really nice service: the bellhop arranged for a Town Car to take us to the airport on our day of departure; cost was about the same as a taxi, but so much more convenient (didn't have to worry about hailing one that morning.)Lots of great places to eat (including, yum, Ess-A-Bagel) right around the corners; we ate at different places every day. Subway just 1.5 -2 blocks away. Great location and we never felt unsafe walking around. Concierge was very friendly, and the front desk staff were helpful.You really had to slam the room doors to get the deadbolt to connect, so that made for some noisy nights when neighbors got home after midnight. But after a couple of nights, my ears adjusted and the noise no longer woke me.The communal bathrooms were roomy and it was rare for all 4 on the hall to be occupied at once. We saw one bathroom had been filled with 3 or 4 bags of garbage by someone. That's the possible drawback of this set-up- you really are relying on the politeness of strangers not to mess up common areas. We didn't have any major problems, but if you had a rowdy floor- ugh.I would definitely stay there again- it was a fun hotel and suited our needs perfectly.",VA,6,4.0

The rooms were fine, clean, modern, and the desk staff was perfectly helpful. However, the experience was completely destroyed by seemingly fraudulent actions on the part of the management group, Woogo. A quick internet search will reveal plenty of genuinely criminal and otherwise dubious practices of WooGo (formerly known as YourStay, which apparently changed names after developing a very shady reputation).We made our reservations through the WooGo website. Once we were in New York, but before we were due to arrive at the hotel, WooGo representatives called our cell phone to offer us a room upgrade for an extra hundred bucks or so over the length of our stay. We accepted, but when we reached the hotel the next day, the staff therehad no record of an upgrade and were unable to accommodate one. We finished our stay with no other apparent problems.Once we returned home and checked our credit card statement, we foundthat, in addition to the legitimate room charge, WooGo had also charged us for the upgrade that we never received AND an additional $1300 (!) charge related to nothing whatsoever.What followed was literally dozens of emails and phone calls to various WooGo personnel in London & New York -- all of whom claimed to not be authorised to issue refunds without the approval of supervisors with whom we were never permitted to speak, and none of whom were able to offer any explanation for the charges. Months passed as we waited to hear from phantom unnamed higher-ups. Finally, we had to threaten the company with pursuing criminal charges, at which time we were granted a refund for the $1300 charge.No refund was ever given for the promised upgrade, and I'm embarrassed to admit that we eventually just gave up.Anyway, don't take my word for it -- Woogo's well-documented reputation speaks for itself.

As we only booked our flight 6 weeks before departure, finding a reasonably priced hotel was quite difficult. Although the people from the booking agency advised us on the Pod hotel, we wrongly thought this must be an overpriced, über- hyped, NY tourist trap. The first 4 nights we booked at an Upper West Side B&B that had a late cancellation as it normally always was fully booked months ahead! After these first nights were booked our luck and hotel options ran out and we decided to take a chance and booked the remaining 3 nights at the Pod. During these evenings of internet searches we actually concluded that the 205$ for a double standard with private bath in this area was actually very reasonable. The area is strongly business orientated during weekdays and thus becomes quiet after working hours. Pubs and restaurants were easy to find around the corner on 2nd avenue.My girlfriend and I are real city slickers and used the 2 nearest subway stations (1 and 2 blocks away) frequently. So getting to the major places was no problem at all. The room itself is indeed tiny but practical in every inch and has an 'upmarket' Ikea feel to it with the sliding shower door, birch wood furniture, closet space under the bed, a stainless steel airliner like sink,a very nice ""rain""-shower and even an (imitation?) Charles & Ray Eames 'Wire Chair'. Although the ideal customer would be the thirty-something urban single or couple that have their own apartment stuffed with Ikea or design like things, we saw everything from a UN-convention visitor to a family with kids and their grand parents! These last will be in for a big surprise when they see their room!I presume nobody stays longer then needed in their room when you’re visiting NYC as a tourist, so the lack of space to walk around was no issue. During our stay the weather was hot (+30 Celsius) and humid but the noisy hidden airco did the job. Clearly noise insulation wasn't the main concern during renovation! The noise, originating mainly from the hallway, could remind you of a hostel. Excessive door slamming because of the shared bath rooms was sometimes annoying ! The trendy lobby and check-in area plus free wireless internet were added bonuses to an overall positive vibe we already had. The hidden gem, during our stay and in the hot weather, was the roof terrace with the skyscraper view. It was a little resting place between an afternoon of shopping and a night on the town. I think some young locals even use it as a personal study or quick getaway from the noisy and busy streets. All personnel were friendly and helpful and checking in and out was quick and painless!

The loud slamming noise will probably wake you up. My only other complaint, is that the bathrooms do NOT have soap or paper towels. So if you go to the bathroom on your way out, you will need to make a trip back to your room to wash your hands. I find this unsanitary and an easy way to spread germs.

The staff (hotel maids) were very friendly, the room has free WiFi, an iPod dock, a safe, and a small flatscreen TV on the wall. You've probably heard / read, that the rooms are very tiny. This is true, I stayed in a single room (one single bed) for almost a week, and I think my walk-in closet in my own apartment was bigger... So if you're in the right mindset (expect very tiny), you won't be disappointed. BUT as said, just for a place to ""crash"", it's perfect.Oh yeah - the shared bathrooms were awesome. They seemed recently fitted, were spotless clean, and there were 4 per floor. I never had to wait for a turn and always looked forward to the relaxing shower after a long day and night.I paid $139+taxes / night for a single room, and that's not really someting I'd consider ""cheap"", but for a CLEAN, well kept room in a superb location, for a Manhattan hotel - there's really no other choice for me!Couple of gripes though. The bed was too short for me (I'm 6.0""), and I couldn't keep the room window open because the fumes from a nearby restaurant kept creeping in (and I was on pretty high floor too).

We found the hotel randomly, searching the internet for cheap NY hotels. I was a little skeptical at first, but after reading the reviews on this website, I knew it would be fine. The Pod is in a great location, its in between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. If you walk out to 2nd there are many restaurants, coffee shops, convienence stores, and a Rite Aid pharmacy. There is a subway stop close, and Rockefeller centre, and Time's Square are a very short walk away. The room was very clean, and was made up very well each day. The shared washrooms were also very clean and the showers were very luxurious. The roof top patio was very nice, and it was nice to go up there, and relax after a day of walking. They had just finished the new bar/lounge that will be in the hotel (just off the lobby). Like the rooms, the new bar/out door lounge is a great use of the space and looks nice too. Very stylish. The concierge was VERY helpful. Every day he had printed up little booklets of things to do in NY on that particular day. So we had an itemized list of the best restuarants, bars, and shopping to do on that particular Tuesday. It also included directions on how to get to these places from the hotel. I would reccomend this hotel, based purely on this service.However, the front desk staff wasnt the best. When we got there, my boyfriends credit card was declined, and the front desk man, was very rude about it. When we told him it had to be a mistake, he insisted it wasnt. We asked if we could call the bank, or use the internet for online banking, he said he couldnt, and directed us to a Kinkos nearby to use the facilities there. Turned out, everything was fine financially, and we treked back from the Kinkos , and found that he had inputted the card incorrectly. He didn't apologize, but when the card was approved, he changed his tune and couldnt be happier to have us stay there. It was annoying, as we had travelled a long way.

I absolutely cannot fault this hotel. The room was immaculate and the standard of daily cleaning was very high. We were in a bunk room with shared facilites on the 7th floor. There were four bathrooms on our floor - every room is just steps away from a bathroom - and we never had to wait for a bathroom despite nearly all the rooms on our floor having guests. The bathrooms were very clean, with superb showers. Bathroom 4 was my favourite with it's body jets! We didn't make it to the rooftop terrace but we did enjoy the free tequilas in the lobby which are provided every Friday. The hotel is uber cool and attracts quite young, trendy clientele. But despite what you might imagine we weren't disturbed by noisy guests. Also, staff were very helpful with any requests for assistance.The bunk rooms are quite small but we expected that. Being women, we didn't exactly pack light, but we have more than enough storage space for all our luggage, clothes and every pair of my friends shoes!! Should also mention the hairdryer was better than dryers I've had in much more expensive hotels - so I won't bother packing mine next time.We absolutely loved this hotel and cannot recommend it enough. I think next time I would contact the hotel in advance to book a cab/limo from the airport as our journey back to Newark which was booked by The Pod bellhop was much cheaper than the NJ taxi we took on arrival.Oh and the hotel is just a two minute walk from the subway and about 7 mins from 5th Avenue!!

Arrived early one evening and the staff were really friendly. I wanted to organise a few things before we went to suprise my bf so emailed them asking for a room as high as possible with a good view and they promptly responded and when we got there the room was great, nice little balcony with a lovely view. The outside deck also is nice for a late drink or take out with a view. Phoned before for some recommendations on bakeries that delivered cupcakes for his birthday and good a really good place. They were huge, pretty and yummy!We had a queen room so lots of space for not much more in price and its own bathroom. TV was good little touch. Fresh towels everyday and the room was SPOTLESS and for me that is all that counts. Make sure you ask the cute blonde guy for the Pod's recommendations and go to some of them, really good personal touch and some of the places are great too!

First time was in November during construction. Amazing use of space, nice accessories (flat screen TV), great concept, reasonably priced, great area, shared bath was no problem at all (and I never get a room with a shared bath anywhere else). Lobby looks fantastic.However, they've got to do something about some of their staff. Tried to check in on a Friday night (already booked online) and, after two attempts, was told a bit curtly ""My card has been declined."" Not what you want to hear after 6 hours in a plane at midnight. I knew this was impossible, but gave her a second card. Again she tried twice and same thing. I called the bank (both cards from the same bank) and, of course, both cards were fine. Name and number had been put in correctly, but, for whatever reason, expiry date incorrectly input both times. After a peculiar question (Is that a 7 or a 1?) about a standard font on both cards, I finally got it sorted out with her without much in the way of apology.Room cleanup was great on Sat and Sun (different staff?), but a little less than great when I got to my room on the Friday night. They missed a hat up on the shelf and rest of room looked so so. No big deal and perhaps there was some minor mixup about whether the previous guest was staying another night. Anyways, everything else about hotel was great, and would stay there again, but they've got to do something about some of the front staff. Some of the other staff that I ran into were great: helpful and courteous. At least train some of the not-so-good ones how to correctly input credit card expiry dates into their system.","Vancouver, Canada",9,4.0

It is situated almost in the middle of a tree lined neighborhood on 51st Street. Everything I read pointed to us having a good experience & our expectations were exceeded. The Pod is a slick & fun, space efficient, modern property for open minded, spirited travelers looking to be safe & comfortable while discovering NYC. Having said that, if you are ""high maintenance"" or just want the ""tourist-y"" experience you might not be happy here.We booked the Queen Pod & were given a great room with a lovely view of 51st Street. The hotel is literally surrounded bydining choices. On either side are French bistros, Monteparnasse & (the hotels own) Le Bateau Ivre (open 'til 4am)continuing on towards 3rd ave is Sushi, Devine Bar for Tapas/ Wine, Seafood, Pasta Presto for Italian, Indian at Amma , a Pub & The Morningstar cafe/diner for economy breakfast-lunch & dinner. As far as forgotton toiletries, just cross to 2nd for a Rite Aid Pharmacy. One extra hidden highlight is the Synoguge across the street boasting a huge waterfall & garden & opening right onto 51st street...a great stop for some serenity, reflection & your morning coffee!The Pod staff was efficient and courteous, attending to our bags without having to be asked & tending to a faulty lightbulb at that moment. On our last morning, we requested a taxi & instead they arranged a ride to the airport with a (flat rate) car service.Like the majority of living space is NY, things are small but with great use of ledges and cubbies, this room worked great for our purposes giving us each enough of our own room to rest & get ready. They do provide a hairdryer everything else is on you. The bathroom in the Queen Pod Room is tight & seperated by only by a frosted sliding glass door so if you're a little shy when nature calls, you might want to take a walk down the hall to one of the private hallway toliets. The shower in our room was one of my favorite points, I love those rainshower heads & the bed & linens were very comfortable.When you are booking know that there are several types of rooms. If you are staying in one of the ""dorm"" type roomsyou will have both shampoo & body wash (& music!) provided for you in the shared but private bathroom/showers down the hall.This hotel was completely renovated last year & according to the conciege, they are in the process of adding what sounds like a very cool bar. Unlike most hotels making changes, any construction went completely unnoticed by using two beautifully painted screens. Another treat is to go up to the 14th floor rooftop garden...who knows what will eventually be constructed up there but it's prime for skyline photos of the city & for now, totally private.As you can guess, I will defintely be staying at the Pod again, my only worry being that this gem gets discovered & will no longer offer a (approx) $200 per night rate in MIdtown Manhattan.","chicago, Il",91,5.0

Very clean room (with lots of fluffy white towels) and clean and bright general areas. Yes the rooms are small but hey, I only showered and slept in mine! The TV, hairdryer, iPod alarm clock and heating/cooling system were a bonus for me after travelling around Costa Rica for 9 nights! I found plenty of storage space in my double room for myself, and there would have been ample storage for two guest's gear without a doubt. The room I had was on the 7th floor and was quiet late at night and in the mornings, although I could hear other guests in the rooms when they used their hairdryer - bizarre. I had a peek in the shared bathrooms on my way to the lift and found them to be very clean.Hotel is in a great location - walking distance of most things (including the deli and small restaurants) and the subway was only a short (ie -5mins) walk away.

Staff was really friendly and helpful. We paid $119/ night, I think a good price for so close to all the action, and somewhere that was not seedy at all. Definitely recommend Pod Hotel.

In its latest incarnation as the Pod I was pretty impressed when I stayed there but it's not for everyone, Clear glass bath/shower doors are only for couples very comfortable with each other. Otherwise the rooms have a much better use of space. Also it's in a handy location, esp for first time visitors maybe intimidated by some of New York's saltier environs.

It’s not meant to be spacious or luxurious, only practical.We had a double room and it looked just like what was promised on the website. We spent the days out and about NYC, so we only came here to sleep and shower and it was perfect for that, even for four nights. The furnishings looked very new and everything was shiny and neat, very clean.The bed is on the firm side, but not uncomfortable. The covering is also minimal, sheet, blanket, bedspread, 2 small pillows. There was a little desk, but that’s the only place you can lay out a suitcase. The TV is a flat-screen mounted on the wall, and there’s an iPod player in the room. There’s also free wireless internet access, all of which is more than you’ll find in many expensive hotels!There is no true “bathroom” – just a showerstall and toilet in the room, and it’s a tight space – your knees touch the shower curtain when you’re sitting down. The shower was normal size, though, and quite nice. Water pressure was so-so (7th floor), but from a big flat showerhead. The only design flaw in the shower area is that the towels are stored in the sink area in the room – don’t forget to put one on the hooks in the shower area BEFORE you start showering. The towels were also so-so quality. Both shower and sink area were shiny and clean.One word of warning, though: because the space is so small, especially the toilet/shower, staying here is a rather intimate experience. It was fine for my husband and me, but I wouldn’t want to stay here with a friend.There was a heating/AC unit but the windows (with wooden shutters) also opened. Our room went out to the back and even with the windows open at night, we did not have any noise issues from outside.Inside is another matter. The walls are pretty thin and you can hear conversations and TV from the next room, and the housekeeping staff vacuuming the halls in the morning.Both the room and bath area had good lighting on dimmer switches. A nice touch!There is no breakfast, but the staff can direct you to a bunch of restaurants around one corner and a bunch of delis around the other corner. There were also some complimentary drinks one evening in the lobby, which was a nice touch.Finally, the location is also practical; a few blocks to the nearest subway station and plenty of restaurants nearby.Despite the efficiency of the pods, it was still over $200/night, which is not exactly cheap, but I believe it was a fair price for NYC.

After reading these reviews i was expecting a little room and that is exactly what we got. It was a great little room though and all we needed . It was really clean and new and the bed was comfortable. The only bad thing was that you can really hear other people. On the first night we could hear everything the girls next door where talking about. Still we picked up some earplugs at the chemist the next day and slept very well for the next two nights. We had a double room with our own bathroom which had a great shower. The one thing i would say is that we could not find any air conditioning for the room (in a guide book it said the hotel did have it but not sure if it does or not) and because it was very warm over the weekend the room was hot during the day. I should think in the summer time it might be quite sticky.The hotel is very well located within easy reach of all the mid town attractions with bloomingdales, fifth avenue and central park within easy reach. Macy's is a bit further along but still within walking distance as is Times Square. There is a subway just up the road which takes you all the way downtown so you can see the sights down there such as the statue of liberty and brooklyn bridge.There is some nice little restaurants round the hotel with a mcdonalds and some little deli's up the road. Don't eat in TGI Fridays. The food is horrible and my other half found a cockroach in his salad!Do go to the top of the rock at the rockefeller centre. We went to both top of the rock and the empire state building but i thought that the top of the rock was by far the best for the views. We went in the evening and didn't have to queue at all!If you fancy going to the Statue of Liberty and you want to go inside the statue it is best to book your tickets online otherwise the likelyhood is you won't get tickets. To go inside and climb up is free but tickets are limited and most people book them up.

There were more restaurants and bars within arms reach than you can believe including some of the city's more highly rated Asian, burger, steak, bakery and bagel places. And, you're not paying tourist prices - sure it's not cheap, but reasonable for Manhattan. If a spacious room is a must, I guess you've got to look elsewhere. But if a sub-200 dollar per night placethat is hip without being minimilist and snotty and offers almost everything one could want in New York, choose The Pod.

I stayed there last year in one of their new pod room, before the hotel completed their renovations, and I was not asked for a deposit then. Last year's room was new too.He put me in a tiny bunk next to the steps for the roof terrace where people where going up and down every five minutes for a smoke. (Noisey!) After a couple of hours, I asked a much nicer ‘front desk’ guy to move me. He was very nice. He let me and my 14 year old child move to a much larger room, (still a bunk room), but indeed much quieter away from the roof terrace steps.Love the individual TV by our beds with plenty of channels. Love PAX nearby for breakfast and other meals during the day, but we usually only had breakfast there.

The rooms are small, but who cares when such little time is spent in them? We had a bunk bed pod with a shared bathroom. The first time I stayed at this hotel, I was hesitant about the ""shared bathroom"" concept. It wasn't bad at all! There is a light in each room to alert guests if bathrooms are occupied. There were four bathrooms on my floor and not once did my son or I have to wait to use one. We enjoyed using the rainfall showerhead with two side showers; this is a little luxury that I highly recommend! The bathrooms were very clean which is something I can't even say about some of the pricier places we've frequented with in-room facilities. A hint to travelers: book online through the Pod's own website. The online price was $40 cheaper than calling the hotel directly.

But, being as we were in new york to exhaust ourselves everyday being out and about, we could have slept through a freight train coming through the walls!IPod dock also a nice touch but also a tad annoying with the noise issue again!Privacy may also be an issue as the toilet/shower has a clear pane of glass into the bedroom! interesting!To sum up- as a young couple, it was perfect- we needed a clean safe comfy base for exploring and this hotel did that and more! For the price, we felt you get far more than expected. We would definatly go back there again, and are recommending it to friends.Well done the Pod !",uk,5,4.0

We had one of the rooms with bunk beds and shared bathrooms. Never experienced any problems with the bathrooms, they were always really clean, and you didn't even have to get out of bed to see if they were free because there are engaged lights above the door! The only time they were busy was first thing in the morning which is to be expected i guess. They even pipe music into the bathrooms and hallways which is a nice touch.Yes, the rooms are very small, but we managed to fit 2 girls, our suitcases and our shopping in with space to spare! You're in New York, how much time are you really gonna spend in your room? Yes, the walls aren't that thick, and if you are unfortunate enough to get noisy neighbours you are going to hear them but that's a problem in many hotels. Individual TVs in the bunks are great - the height of lazyness! And the ipod dock is very useful, it meant i didn't have to pack my charger.The reception area is now finished and they actually opened the main entrance while we were there. All very nice, lots of seating which came in useful when we were waiting to be picked up to go to the airport. Everyone was very friendly, especially the concierge who was really useful if you had any questions. One of the TVs in our room didn't work, a maintenance guy was sent straight up to fix it.It is in a good area, there are two subway stations about 5 minutes walk away and it is easy to walk to a number of famous sights nearby. There are lots of good restaurants along 2nd Avenue, everything from fish restaurants to diners to pizza takeout so you don't need to go very far. The most amazing cupcakes can be found at the Buttercup Bake Shop around the corner as well. If you go to the 14th floor and go up the stairs there is a roof garden with a good view over the surrounding area - very nice in the sunshine.The only thing i would say as a negative is that the towels they provide are very small. You need to take a change of clothes into the bathroom with you as you wouldn't be able to walk back to your room without flashing someone! So if that's going to be a problem just pack a towel. Overall, a really good value hotel that i would recommend and that i would definately stay in when i next go to New York. Let's just hope that now they've finished refurbishing it that they don't put the prices up!",London,45,5.0

The shared bathrooms were the cleanest shared bathrooms I have used in a hotel and one of the bathrooms has a lovely big shower with multiple shower heads and we never had to wait for a shower. On our second stay we had a double with a private bathroom.

My friend and I shared a bunk bed room on the 12th floor, with shared bathroom facilities. As was expected, the room was very (very!) small, but if you are not too messy and can get organized, you’ll do fine. It’s fun to linger in bed and watch a show on the individual plasma TVs when you come back after a long walk around the city. Everything feels new and fresh in the room, and the beds are comfortable. There are always miniature soaps and bottles of shampoos near the in-room sink and the window can be open to let the fresh air in. The maids are efficient and friendly. I never waited once to get a bathroom – and they are great, with a rain shower and lower massage heads, slate floor and miniature sink for that special “boutique hotel” feel. Groovy music always plays in the bathroom and halls, making for a very funky and hip ambiance. The only thing they could improve on would be to add a paper towel dispenser to use after you wash your hands, because it’s kind of a hassle to always have to think about bringing a hand towel with you when you go to the bathroom only to pee (unless you wait to come back to your room to wash them). Also, it would be nice if they put pneumatic stoppers on the door to prevent the slamming that occurs, as it can get annoying when a lot of guests are coming and going. I sleep with earplugs myself and didn’t mind it all that much, but it can be bothersome to some people. The lobby of the hotel has a lovely mid-century modern feel to it, with tulip chairs, colorful murals and cool couches to lounge on while you wait for a friend or a ride. The materials used (blond wood, slate, marble) are very nice and give a modern look to the interior design. On two evenings while we were there, there was a happy hour with free tequila shots and margaritas, but it was not too much of a party atmosphere, just a cool event to mingle with other guests. The staff is very helpful. You can leave your luggage at the hotel after checking out if you want to enjoy a few hours on the town before going back home. The hotel can also arrange any transportation you need. We took a town car back to JFK and it cost us US$45 plus tip.We also loved the location on 51st near 2nd: you are 3 minutes away from the Lexington subway station and a short walk away from the big stores of Fifth avenue, Rockefeller center, the Moma, etc. At the concierge desk, there is a list of “Pod recommended” restaurants, bars and stores. We went twice to the Morning Star Café on 2nd Street for breakfast and it was good, it’s a nice family diner. We also went twice to Le Bateau Ivre, a very good French bistro and wine bar just downstairs from the hotel (you can even leave your coat in your room, since it’s so close). Try the tartine au brie et miel (crusty bread with Brie cheese and honey, served with a salad) and the soupe à l’oignon (onion soup topped with bread and cheese) with a nice glass of wine. Some of the Bateau staff even speak French! We went back for a late night dessert (it closes at 4am) and a glass of Sauternes and the waitress noticed that we were French Canadians and talked to us in our native language from then on. It was a nice touch. We also enjoyed Takana, a Japanese restaurant about 5 doors down, and the Azure deli at the corner of 51st Street and 3rd avenue – perfect for takeout or grabbing a quick bagel on the way.So basically, I think I just found MY New York City budget hotel. I loved everything about it and the price was right. It’s the perfect place for travelers who like fun hotels and don’t need a lot of luxury, but still want to travel in style.","Montreal, Canada",43,4.0

It was a great hotel - loved the location, and while the rooms were small, they were fine. The foldout LCD screen TV was a big hit with my son (and confirmed for me why we will never let him have a TV in his room - addicting!)I found the staff here very friendly and helpful. While sitting in the very comfortable lobby having breakfast one morning (bought at Pax, right down the street for $5), I overheard a conversation between a very distraught young woman from Denmark who apparently had lost her money and was trying to get cash from her credit card. The staff were very sympathetic and really trying to help.My one bad experience was with the airport shuttle they recommended to Newark, which is AirLink. The shuttle arrived on time, but proceeded to spend 1.5 hours (!!) driving around to various hotels in Manhattan, picking up others and eventually loading the van to capacity, then trying to leave Manhattan at 4:45 PM, right at the height of PM rush. We had several riders who were trying to catch international flights out of Newark and were quite upset - by the time we entered the Holland Tunnel 1 hour before my scheduled flight departure (when I expected to be at the airport, worst case, since this was TWO HOURS after we left my hotel less than 2 miles away across Manhattan) I had resigned myself to missing my flight and was on the phone to my airline. Amazingly, we made the flight with moments to spare, but I fault Pod Hotel for recommending a very greedy shared shuttle service.","Bainbridge Island, Washington",28,3.0

I had read a small article in a swedish newspaper about the newly renovated The Pod Hotel which was quite positive but pointing out that the rooms were very small but nice. I then found reviews here and on other websites and most of the were positive so I booked my 3 nights at the hotel website. I booked a single pod with shared bath and the price was less than $ 100 per night.I arrived in the evening and got a nice room on the 7th floor. The room was very comfortable and clean. The shared bath was not a problem at all. I used the same one every time and it was always availible and clean.The location was great and the staff was helpful as I as a first-time visitor to New York had some questions now and then.I hope to be able to go back to New York and The Pod soon and I will definitely recommend it to others looking for a affordable and nice place to stay in New York.,"Near Stockholm, Sweden",9,4.0

NYC can be a busy and expensive place, while The Pod manages to keep rates cheap and the atmosphere relaxing. Was not impressed with the lobby or hallways and I must admit on the elevator ride up to our room I was beginning to think ""Well I got what I paid for""... Honestly the hallways are very dark and narrow, a little uninviting.... BUT and this is a huge BUT... WE LOVED OUR ROOM! We opted for the room with the bunk beds and were very pleasantly surprised by the bright decor and cleanliness of our room. We also found it to be much bigger than was expected!!! The shared bathrooms were not a problem at all! There were 4 on our floor (each had a toilet and a shower) and in our room there was a panel with lights showing what rest rooms were vacant at any given time. I cannot remember more then one ever being used. They were also very clean. The bunk beds and individual TV's were really fun and different, we enjoyed the character that brought to the room. It is truely close to everything, we walked everywhere, but the subway is very close to the hotel.... We took the train in from CT to Grand Central and the hotel was very easy to find/walk to. I would recommend this hotel to people who like to experience new things and who can appreciate a simple, clean place to stay. Didnt offer much else other than the rooms hotel wise... but who needs much else when you are in NYC, especially the area where the Pod is located!","Hartford, CT",16,4.0

We stayed in a bunk with a shared bath. I was a little worried about that but it wasn't bad at all. There never was a time that I had to wait to use the restroom or shower. Not to mention it was right outside my door. I must say that if you are expecting a 5 star go somewhere else. This is not a 5 star hotel nor does it claim to be. I was looking for something decent, cheap and just somewhere to lay my head at night. I got exactly that. My daughter and I were a little cramped since the bunk rooms are about 7 X10 ft. If you plan ahead so that both of you dont need the mirror and sink at the same time, it will be fine. The room and shared baths were kept very neat and clean. I also enjoyed the roof top deck. If you are a smoker the rooftop is a great place to go since you cant smoke in your room. This hotel is only 2 blocks from the subway. 2 French and Japanese restaurants right next door. You have to check out PAX foods on the corner of Lexington and 3rd. It's on the way to the subway. Great food at good prices.

I had expected the room to be small, mostly because of the hotel's own website, but we had the good fortune to be given a wheelchair accessible room, which meant that the room and bathroom were much bigger than expected. The room was clean with everything you could ask for - a comfortable bed and a good shower. A bonus was the iPod dock, which was great!! Only suggested improvement: the bedroom would have benefited from a mirror, rather than the one mirror in the bathroom. The only time we had a problem, was a shortage of hot water - we rang reception and it was sorted out very quickly and the problem didn't recur. When we were leaving, the bell captain quickly arranged our transport to the airport. Everyone was courteous and helpful, the room was clean and comfortable, close to sights and subway. I can highly recommend the Pod Hotel - we'll certainly look at it as our first option on any future return trip to New York.","Sunderland, UK",6,4.0

I wished to pay cash and they then started insisting that i paid another 100 dollar as a securiy to their room which allegedly cost them 2000 dollars to renovate, although it is all very smoke and lights ikea esk renovation that i wouldnt have thought would have cost them 200 dollars to do up the whole hotel. when I refused to pay extra the OWNER of the hotel was screaming at me and threatening to cxl my room, obviously i had 0 choice as i would not have been able to find another room on a weekend.Als o they harp on about it being renovated blah blah - the renovation as i say is very tackily and cheaply done, and the room is smaller than my closet at home.Pay more to get more, I will never ever darken their doors again",london,2,1.0

The hotel - that would be better named 'hostel' - wasvery basic and there was renovations going on, on two floors. This is called a budget hotel and seemed popular with backpackers, students, immigrants from poorer countries, and single older men. I moved to the Pickwick from another midtown Hotel (that cost me $230a night) because I had to extend my days in the city and the one I was at had no rooms for the extra days. Being on a real busy scheduleand not knowing the city well, I found rooms from $400 and up a nightwhich was too much. I was told by someone I could downscale a bit forgood value at the Pickwick. I booked and paid around $190 a night with tax included which really floored me once I saw it, because the room was a complete dump and the shower was in the hallway. I don't mind simplicity, people, but there is a difference between the word'simplicity' and 'dump'. I have now been to NYC quite a few times andnow know what my money can bring; let's just say I wont stay at The Pod again. The room was so old and outdated it reminded me of accommodation you would give to the homeless. The carpet was smelly and old (I was in a non-smoking room but it reeked of old smoke), andthere was a TV and phone on the room that looked like movie props from the 60's. The whole room felt so dirty that I even felt uncomfortable sleeping in the sheets and would sleep with my clothes on!The shower (in the hallway, and they don't provide you with any robe to use) was so small you could barely fit. And bringing fresh clothes to change was not an option, since there was no room to really move around in it to change or sufficient hooks to hang them on without getting wet.Although the room was a dump, and the reception old fashioned but acceptable, the location was all right for New York. Not great but all right. There is a nice restaurant next door with good quality food, and a nice crowd in the evenings. There are a string of restaurants within walking distance on the next street over (2nd). I also had access to a laundrymat only one block away on 2nd Avenue. But for breakfast avoid 2nd Ave; I think I had the worse breakfast in my life on 2nd Avenue. Rather opt for 3rd Avenue if you want better options for morning snacks. 1st and 2nd Avenue and so on, is not exactly what most visitors want to see on Manhattan and is rundown and boring.The location on 53rd and 3rd Avenue is good for New York, but is a bit off so you will end up walking a lot even to get to transportations, unless you take a taxi which gets expensive since traffic is gruesome. This location is not at all good for someone who has difficulty walking. There is no subway in immediate proximity, and remember that one block on Manhattan is about 3-4 times the length of a city block in, say, the midwest or Europe. So, you get the idea how long one square block actually is. Buses only go northbound on 3rd Avenue. You can catch a southbound bus on Lexington, the next street, but the stop may be 2 blocks down so even if it sounds really close, it is really not. If you try to get westward towards central midtown for more action, the closest busstand would be on either 49th or 57th (the hotel is on 53rd). In either way, you have to walk, walk, walk to catch transportation. Always bring real good walking shoes to New York; forget about fashion and trying to impress. Just be comfortable or it gets painful. When I heard from other guests that they had paid less ($110) than me for new rooms and just booked them a few days before me, I felt pretty upset. I mean, why would they get a better room paying less? I was staying in a smelly dump!I got delayed getting back to the hotel (traffic can be gruesome on manhattan) to pack and depart and had forgotten a pair of pants that belonged to an expensive suit. Returning home, my clothes were organized into my closet by my cleaning lady so I did not notice the pants were missing until two months later. To add insult to injury from my stay, I called the hotel who confirmed that they indeed had found the pants, but they only keep found items for 30 days and had thrown them away. Now, if they actually found them in the room and KNOW who the guest is and have all my contact information, including email, why on earth could they not spend a minute (that's all it takes) to email me and let me know I forgot a personal item while checking out???I do understand the hotel seem to have made some more renovations since I was there. But the exaggeratedly optimistic reviews about this hotel, which is really an expensive hostel, seem fake and I wonder if the hotel had staff write it? Seriously, they had a few newly renovated rooms in the hotel that were displayed on photos on big boards in the lobby, with bunk beds that were perfectly clean and great for students but it was NOTHING extraordinary at all (Ikea,people. It's all Ikea furniture) and were priced at more than $200 plus taxes, which is not cheap for that standard. If they would be priced at about $100 a night, I would say that was a really great deal for the new rooms. But their rates are more like $200-300 in total with taxes.I can honestly say this is an overpriced option for students, backpackers who are used to bunkbed arrangements. If you find nothing better, great. Otherwise, you are not really getting that great of a deal for a hotel that is actually more like a hostel (even if it is now a brand new hostel).",California,10,1.0

I have stayed in many hotels in NYC (from the Hyatt to the San Carlos) and the Pod Hotel has been my favourite by far. As soon as we stepped out of our shuttle there was a courteous staff that took our bags in the lobby. This area looked like a lounge with chillout music playing. Check-In was a breeze as well as checking out. We had the bunk bed pod that overlook 51st street and was well put together with the miniscule space available in the room. It was great to have the individual TV and I suggest to bring headphones to drown any outside noises while sleeping. The room was very clean and it was made every day. Beds were comfortable, an extra pillow would be nice to have, which you can request from the front desk. There were four shared bathrooms on the 5th floor where we stayed. We were lucky to have WC4 right across from us which was the biggest bathroom, WC 1 & 2 were small, and WC 3 had a hallway leading to the toilet and shower. As the other reviews stated there was always a bathroom available, very clean, and the shower was an experience to remember. On Friday and Saturday they had a social gathering serving free cuervo shots and maragritas. The terrace above the 14th floor is not completed, but worth seeing since it had amazing skyline view of the neighborhood. Overall, I highly reccomend the Pod Hotel for it's cleanliness, affordability, and courteous staff. Most of their patrons were not all teenagers, I saw guests ranging from age 19 to 70. Most of the guests were from Europe. My tip is to reserve your pod on the hotel website since it was less expensive than the other travel sites. Airlink is their official shuttle that drops and picks up guest to the hotel from all three major airports in the viscinity. I suggest booking your reservation on their website as you save $6 for roundtrip transportation. Places to eat around the neighborhood would be Tanaka for good sushi next door, on the corner of 51st and 3rd is PAX with good soup, salad, and desserts, and for breakfast Ess A Bagel serving a wide selection of cream cheese flavors. If you are looking for a memorable experience without hurting your wallet in NYC, the Pod Hotel is the #1 choice. Since its opening, the Pod Hotel has become popular and regarded as the next best boutique hotel in NYC. So hurry and reserve your pod before the price begins to increase due to its popularity.

I'd booked the hotel after reading numerous (mainly) positive reviews on the hotel, and would agree with most of what has been said. There are definitely more positives than negatives when reviewing the Pod. Having, on a previous stay in New York, had the hassle of having to travel in and out of New Jersey every day, I'd start by mentioning the location. You're 5 minutes walk away from midtown 5th Avenue and the Rockefeller Centre. It's really handy to be able to walk to so much of what you want to see, especially if time is short. Plus, the area the hotel is in is pretty good. Just around the corner on 2nd avenue there's plenty of bars and restaurants, so if you do want to stay very local on a night the option is there.As for the hotel itself, it's easy to see that it's been recently renovated. The lobby and entrance is very stylish and clearly new. The main entrance is currently being worked on so you enter just down the street, but that isn't a problem. We stayed in a standard room, with a private bathroom. Again, stylish fittings and pleasant design. The room was spotlessly clean, and fresh towels were supplied daily. The television is new, and again, impressive. We also didn't find storage a problem, with extra drawers under the bed.As for negatives, it all depends on what you expect from a hotel room. We booked the room based on location and price, and weren't disappointed. But it must be stressed, the room is small. The double bed is cosy to say the least, especially if you're tall. In fact, it's reminiscent of a sofa bed. On a morning, there is little room to get ready when there's two of you. Plus, with the sink in the main body of the room, it can get a bit messy if you inadvertantly put the taps on full blast! The bathroom itself doesn't give a lot of privacy. If you're especially shy, you mightn't like sharing. There is a frosted glass compartment you can pull across, but if you're using the toilet, you do feel a bit on display.Our other main problem isn't really the hotel's fault, but there was a lot of noise from other guests during the night. The soundproofing on the room isn't great, and it did disturb our sleep a bit. Having stayed in many hostels over the years, I was used to that, and in New York you don't expect peaceful nights. But if you need total quiet to sleep, you'll be in for a tough time.Overall though, it was a postive experience. New clean rooms, lovely lobby, great location, and very affordable. You could do lot worse for a short break in New York. Just don't expect the Waldorf-Astoria!",Cramlington,5,4.0

What a great jewel for the price. We paid $109.00 plus tax for a petite room with 2 bunk beds. When they say petite, they mean petite!! I would say the room was approx. 8 x 10'. Every speck of space was utilized. There was a small stainless steel sink in the room. Ample space to hang clothes & even a small hook to hang a jacket. Each bunk had its own TV. There was a small desk & chair with a clock on the desk. I never thought I would be staying in a room with a shared bath, but honestly, even tho we were only there for 1 night, I never saw anyone in the hallway or the bath room. There were 4 bathrooms on our floor & our room had a light above the door indicating which bathrooms were in use. The bathrooms were very clean. Each bathroom had lots of shampoo and shower gel in the shower area. The rainhead shower was awesome as well as the jets of water that shot out from the side of the shower. Our room was right next door to the shower/bath room.I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Maybe if I was in NY for a full week, I would look for a larger place, but all in all, for the money, this place can't be beat. Incidentally, if possible, book over the internet, as the prices were higher when I called to make a reservation. I was told, that the internet rate was only for booking over the internet.I cannot emphasize enough -- this room (the Petite Room) was small. Smaller than anyplace I have ever seen, but it was very, very clean. To me, the cleanlyness of this place compensates for the size.The Morningstar Cafe just around the corner is a very good and inexpensive place to eat. The portions are hugh. The subway was only a few blocks away.In summary, if you are going to spend time lounging in your room, look for a bigger place.

Interesting experience. I joked about the ""Dickinsonian"" name and hoped for the best. By the time I arrived (one month later) the business cards at the desk read ""The Pod Hotel"" which is as accurate a name as one could hope for. Overall, it was not a bad experience.I was only in town one night, in Wednesday, out again Thursday so I was looking for a bed, bath and peace and quiet. I mostly received what I needed. The price was fine, $130 total for the night. The bed and the room were both small but newly refurbished. The clock radio/I-pod dock worked well as did the cute little LED TV on the wall. The shower was exceptional, but the toilet was practically in the shower too but not really a problem. The room sleeping area contained a wash basin and mirror that reminded me of a high-speed train in Germany but served well for shaving and drawing a glass of water.The only complaint I had was the behavior of some guests on my floor. The Pod has some ""shared bath"" accommodation rooms for the really frugal. It seems young male drunks need to accompany each other to the toilet around 2:00 A.M. and they are unable to speak at a normal volume. Small halls and thin doors conduct the sound really well!There is no restaurant in the hotel but one next door to the entrance and many more on Second or Third.

I usually try priceline and use betterbidding.com to advise me on what to expect. They said anything uder $100. base rate would be only a 1 star. They recommended I go to a site to book the POd. I first read the reviews here and saw the renovation was new. They officially change name from Pickwick Arms THIS WEEK. I knew the rooms and bed would be small and so I booked a ""double"" for $89. plus tax ($101.) even though I was just one tall person. I wanted a quiet room and got it. It's an interesting design concept. Evety space is used. Think of a SMALL dorm room and you get the idea. The double bed was 6' 4"" ing and about two pillows wide. But you sleep parralell to the wall (think of a standard double bed turned 90 degrees. The windows open which a lot of redone hotels don't have. Bed was comfortable though only a light blanket. The room was SPOTLESS and BRAND new. I chose private bath. ($20.00 less for shared) but checked out the shared ones. There were 5 I think on my floor (11th Floor - I had room 1124). Each has a toilet,sink and shower.). In morning the flooors were obviously wet. My shower was actually LARGE. Fixed overheard nozzel almost touched my head (I'm 6' 3""). 20 in plasma TV is fixed on wall and doesn't pivot. That's fine. The Clock Radio has ipod docking station but it only accepts iPods, not other MP3 players without a cable. Sound okay. Used the wake up call, service from front desk and it was fine.Especially if you are looking for a room to bunk on short notice, I think this is a great choice. Will use when I can't find a bargain through Priceline or Hotwire. And the neighborhood is great and quiet. Oh I forgot, I heard no hall noise from my room and, as I faced the back, no outside noise even with window open.Now if they keep prices under $100 for a double, I think this will be a great resource.P.S.

Make sure to leave your do not disturb sign out ( I forgot 2 days in a row only to awakened by very loud knocking from the maid service) if you do not want to be up super early. All in all, a good choice because you really don't come to NYC to hang out in your hotel room. It was clean, safe, affordable and well-located. I would stay here again.",North Carolina,1,4.0

We paid $129 + tax for a total of $149 for the night. We stayed in a bunk bed room with no bathroom. Both of our reaction to the bedroom was 'oh it is so cute!'. Nice small stainless sink in the room, both bunkbeds have flat sceen tvs, but we only used them the check the weather channel once. We happened to arrive when maids were cleaning a room with a double bed and bathroom (ensuite) we peeked in and it was lovely. All the staff we encountered were very, very pleasant.The bathroom was near our room, never once went to use it and found it occupied. These are not locker-room style bathrooms with multiple toilets, showers, etc., but individual bathrooms containing a toilet, vanity and shower with one of the rainfall type heads. During our stay the hotel was quiet, but I did hear some morning activity around 6am, which did awaken me as I am a light sleeper. Our room was very near the bathroom, which also are near the main hallway to the elevator, so a room further away would deal with this, my sister, not a light sleeper, was not bothered at all.The roof deck on the 14th floor is not to be missed. I saw no indication anywhere in the hotel there was a roof deck, I only knew from this website. The 14th floor looks a little rough, so I would guess it is still undergoing renovations. The door to the deck is just marked with 'Stair B'. And upon opening the door, the stairwells appearance gave us the impression you are not supposed to be there. Fear not, go up the stairs and you will be rewarded. It is fantastic. It is what changed the hotels rating from Above Average to Excellent for us. This view for $149 a night, what a deal!The other stand out asset on the street is a tapas resturant called Divine Bar. Fantastic, and worthy of a review all of its own. To summarize - If you are the kind of person who loves hanging out in their hotel room, do not come here. If you are there primairly to sleep and clean up before enjoying NYC, then I think you will really enjoy Pickwick Arms.",Upstate NY,7,5.0

The staff was helpful. We stayed in a full-size suite with it's own bathroom (dinky but sparklingly functional, the commode is separated from the shower by a curtain). As other reviewers have attested, rooms here are teeny-weeny but remarkably well planned. My husband was thrilled about the luxury of an in-room iPod docking station. The rooftop was my favorite amenity beyond the nice room. We had no trouble with elevators and everything I saw, including the shared bathrooms, were fastidiously kept.Sadly, the bed was more comfortable than my bed here at home.The Pickwick is not a very far walk to the green train or the blue train, and we used the blue train (E) to the JFK AirTrain to make our flight-- it was much more thrifty than spending 45 on a cab. Then again, we traveled light and schlepping a large suitcase on the subway could have been a hassle. I didn't like that our room rate was 229.00 plus taxes, (it's only a one-star hotel here on TripAdvisor) but for the location in a residential, quieter part of midtown I suppose I have no license to grouse about it, especially since we enjoyed it so much.I'd recommend the Pickwick Arms Hotel!","New Hartford, New York",15,4.0

I'm not sure if I should review this place as the fewer people who know about it the better for us on our next visit!! The foyer was under construction as was some of the 2nd floor, however, this caused us no inconvenience whatsoever. All is due to be completed by the end of 2006... We stayed in an Exec Queen room on the 3rd floor (one queen sized bed with small ensuite). Flat screen TV and safe. Not much room to move around, however, it was spotless, comfortable and so handy for all of the sights etc that we'll be back. The lift was not slow for us, as mentioned in past reviews. Check-in/check-out was quick, friendly and hassle free. Staff were very helpful at check-in as was the bell captain. Fare from hotel to Newark airport was $40 for us both in a shared minibus compared to $63 (+ tip) one way on way in in taxi/private hire car. Great diner round the corner from hotel called the ""Morning Star"". Open 24/7. All rooms seem to be called ""Pod"" rooms irrespective of what type of rooms they are. Don't know why. There were 4 public shared bathrooms on our floor ( and I assume all others). We looked in and they seemed very clean at various times of the day so if you don't want to pay for an ensuite, I don't think you need worry. There is a good view from the roof terrace (14th floor), and there is a lovely little park with waterfall across the road about 30m away that sells coffee and snacks. Good to see that even this outdoor ""park"" is smoke free. New York appears to have banished smokers to stand outside (sometimes not allowed to even stand outside their place of work!!) Hotel is naturally a smoke free zone. We walked for many miles everywhere every day, however, subway stops are all around. This place is very safe! We never felt in any way threatened at all throughout our NY holiday, whilst the hotel is in a quiet residential type area. Pickwick Arms is between 2nd and 3rd Ave on 51st St, ie about 4 blocks from 5th Ave and 15 mins walk from Time Square.That should give you a positive flavour for the place. We would highly recommend it (though it is very different from the type of hotels we usually stay in). You go to NY for the atmosphere etc...not to sit in your hotel room!

At least 7 sets of people from overseas and limited English, first time in New York, and no help whatsoever. They even went so far as to discuss guests and say disparaging things about them, literally behind their back. The hotel manager was never available and has yet to return my phone calls.

After reading all of the reviews, I knew to expect small, but clean rooms, with a shared bathroom in the hall, and a good (and safe) location. I found all of this to be true. Like many others, I never had to 'fight' for a free bathroom, and because it saved me literally $100 a night (compared to other lodgings), it was well worth it to me to book a room without one. There's not a lot of floor space, so yes, large suitcases might not be able to be stored in rooms as someone complained, but perhaps one can unpack and ask the front desk to keep the bag in the luggage room? I found the desk attendants to be very nice. Again, I can only highly recommend the PA for those who think they'd be happy with what they're getting after reading these reviews--you'll probably be impressed.

The shared bathrooms, of which there were four on our floor, were also spotless and there was never a wait during our entire stay there. The location is convenient to the subway (1 1/2 blocks), Rockefeller Center (5 blocks) as well as some great restauarants. Try the PAX health food store on the corner and their great breakfast quiche. The only quibble, and it was a minor one, is that the small TV's they extended from the wall over each bed did not have the greatest reception. But, really, you're in New York City.

The room I had was of ample size and had very modern decor. The bed was comfy and the room had everything that could be needed (a safe, sink, desk area, small flat screen TV). Having been slightly concerned about the shared bathroom, I can assure anyone who is staying there that this is a non issue. Again, the bathroom was well decorated with a modern feel. It was clean at all times and I never had to wait at all. The bathroom offers a fully private space and a great overhead shower. On top of this, the roof toop garden offers a great place to sit at any time of the day and enjoy the sights and sounds of the city. When I was there, it was always fairly quiet and offered a nice peaceful outdoor space. The hotel is situated in a fantastic and safe area, with many dining options available 24 hours. You are in walking distance of many tourist attractions such as Central Park, 5th Avenue, Empire State Building and travelling further afield is made easy by the local subway line and the many cabs and buses. I would truly recommend exploring as much of Manhattan on foot as possible though. There are also many pubs and bars around the local area particularly on 2nd Avenue which might be of interest. The clientel is a mixed bag of business types and younger students. The only slight concerns for the pickier of travellers is that the lobby is still under light renovation although this caused absolutely no noise pollution whatsoever and the elevators can be a tad slow particularly when busy. These basically insignificant facts in no way detract from a great value for money place to stay however. I hope to return to the Pickwick Arms in the near future.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",9,4.0

This hotel was the utter basics - at least my room and I had one without shower, the ""classic"" rooms. Shower was in the hallway and the stall was so tiny you should be prepared to be no larger than a size 6. The room was on the passing mark and not very clean (my candid photo actually makes the room look better than it was). The carpet and upholstery was outdated and a bit smelly and I had to wear my shoes cause I felt a bit nautiated walking barefoot. My TV was a museum piece from the 70's with only 5 channels functioning, which rather suprised me as televisions are very cheap in the US so you wouldnt expect this even in a cheap hotel.The staff was extremely helpful in the reception; I had a week reserved and my room was not available during all the days. They managed to arrange it though, so I did not have to move from room to room. Overall, they were all helpful and friendly. Seems some of the newer rooms that were popular with students were much better and brand new. Availability is tough with this hotel which is a bit hard to understand as rooms are now over $200 a night plus tax, a rate you can find in much better hotels on Manhattan during this season.Location, however, is good. A bit off for walking and you really have to walk a few BIG blocks to get to the subway but location is still very good for this part of the city.If you happen to get a room for $100 and are not picky, I would say its worth it and this hotel is far better than the dingy Vanderbuilt hostel which was awful.

I'm happy to report that the hotel met all my expectations!I have stayed in NYC before at the Millenium Hilton in the financial district, the Belvedere Hotel in midtown west, and the Excelsior Hotel on the upper west side. This was my first experience staying in midtown east.I booked a newly remodled, single ""pod"" room (with shared bath) directly with the hotel for $99 a night, plus tax. My total bill on check out was exactly $347.22. How great is that? I would STRONGLY recommend this hotel to anyone who just needs a very clean, safe, comfortable hotel close to Times Square. If all you're going to do is sleep and shower in your room, this hotel fits the bill perfectly. It's not really a place where you'd want to lounge about, but that's not what most of us go to New York for, is it? All I want is clean, safe, comfortable and AFFORDABLE room so I can get cleaned up and have a good night's sleep, and I'm a happy camper. Pickwick Arms meets all my criteria... and at bargain prices, for sure!!The room itself was VERY small, as other posters have said, but it was EXTREMEMLY CLEAN and VERY FUNCTIONAL. There was plenty of room for my suitcase and hanging clothes and the room even had a small desk and chair, a telephone, and a nifty alarm clock that had an I-Pod dock so you could just pop your I-Pod into it and enjoy your own music in the room. There was also a very nice wall-mounted flat-screen LCD television with remote control. The bed was on a platform that had three drawers underneath it for storing your clothes. The small window had really neat shutters that blocked out almost all of the light so that the room was very dark when it came time to finally hit the sack and recover after a long day on the street of New York. I can't say enough about how clean this hotel was. Everything was brand new, shiny, bright, and clean. I didn't find a spec of dust or dirt anywhere... and I looked hard! The housekeeping staff here deos a bang-up job.The hotel itself is in the shape of a U... with the base of the U on the west side facing 3rd Avenue.. The rooms either face out onto 51st Street and 52nd Street OR they face the inside courtyard formed by the insides of the U... in other words, the inside rooms look out onto each other. I'd recommend that you get an ""inside"" room as I did because those rooms are probably quiter than rooms facing the street. I had an inside room on the 9th floor and I never heard a single sound from the street during my stay there... and I'm a light sleeper. The hotel is not in a noisy location to begin with, but the inside rooms will give you an extra measure of sound-proofing as opposed to a room that faces 51st Street.A word about the SHARED BATHROOMS... Does the idea of sharing a bath give you the willies? Well, it shouldn't. Each floor has four bathrooms. I checked out all four on the 9th floor at varying times of the day and they were always SPOTLESS! Only once did I find a bathroom that had a little water on the floor from the previous user's shower, but the hotel provides a nice little bath mat for each room, so I just put mine down on the floor and all was well. The toilets were always gleaming and the stainless steel sinks in each bathroom were always very clean. The only thing that could have been better is for the hotel to provide paper towels in the bathroom so you don't have to carry your own hand towel with you to the bathroom if all you're needing to do is use the toilet. Other than that, the shared baths were perfect. They all are done in nice dark MARBLE walls, floors, and shower stalls, the shower curtain is bright white and the shower... OH, let me tell you about the shower! Each shower has one of those ""rain"" showerheads where water drops down on you gently from directly overhead... and there are also two adjustable water jets on the walls that spray water at you sideways... about waist high. Really cool! The water temperature was terrific and the pressure was more than adequate. Can you tell I LOVED this shower? The front-desk personnel were friendly and efficient. I arrived at 12:30 pm and they let me check in early. The other guests at the hotel ranged in age from 20-somethings to 70-somethings. I heard several different languages being spoken by other guests, so it seems that the word must be out in Europe about this terrific hotel.There are several great restaurants near the hotel that I would recommend. A gourmet (but very affordable) sandwich and salad place called PAX is at the end of the block on 51st Street and 3rd Avenue, as is a terrific bagel joint called Ess-A-Bagel where I got a toasted pumpernicket bagel (the largest bagels in New York!) with ham and egg for only $3.95 and a great cup of coffee for a $1. The bagel sandwich was so large that I ate half for breakfast and then wrapped up the other half and put it in my backpack for lunch. So, for $5 I got a hot healthy breakfast and a nice afternoon lunch/snack. What a deal! There is a 24-hour grocery store/deli (""Azure""?)right across the street from PAX and Ess-A-Bagel, so you can pick up a bottle of water or some munchies on the way back to the hotel at any hour. I found this to be very convenient. They also sell coffee, fruits, cheese, and veggies, so you could easily pick up picnic things for a nice lunch in Central Park.Across the street from the Pickwick Arms is an incredible little park with a terrificly large waterfall that you just MUST SEE! It's small, but cozy, clean, and refreshing. A real respite from the hustle and bustle of the streets.In closing, I'd recommend the Pickwick Arms to any traveller who wanted a minimum of luxury and a maximum of comfort and safety. The bunk-bed or single-bed pods will remind you of a berth on a train or a large (albeit nicely-decorated) prison cell, but if all you're using the hotle for is to sleep, you won't be disappointed in the Pickwick Arms. I'll definitely be back!!!!PS... One of the highlights of my trip was taking a couple of free guided walks of Central Park. For information about the many free walking tours and current schedules, just check out the Central Park website. I took the walks called ""Amble Through the Ramble"" and ""Cross-Park Promenade."" Both were excellent (and FREE!) and took about an hour each. The guides were volunteers with the Central Park Consevancy and they were both wonderful. It's a great way to see the park. Highly recommended! And did I say they were FREE???? Happy travels!","Portland, Oregon",63,4.0

I settled on the Pickwick as the reviews were better than the other.Upon arrival, the lobby was under renovation, so it was dark and a little claustrophobic. Despite the renovations, we couldn't hear any drilling or hammering.The staff are curt and polite, not ones for chit chat! We had a problem with our toilet, which was fixed in 5 mins. At the end of our stay, we kept our luggage with the porter whilst we went around one last time.The POD rooms are tiny, which suited us as we are quite petite, however the close proximity of everything (inc shower and toliet) means that you get very little space of your own. On our first night, I was woken at 2am by the bar/ restaurants downstairs (the hotel is between two). Granted it was a Saturday night, but ear plugs saved me from too bad a nights sleep. On the other nights, the bars were relatively quiet.Location wise, the area is a business district, so expect it to be quiet on the weekend, but is very busy weekdays. It is within walking distance of the Chrysler and Grand Central, which we used as our landmark. Subway and bus lines are at the end of the road, so it's easy to get around. Food shops nearly on every corner, so you won't starve!Pet hate - The lifts are VERY slow.Considering we were in NY to enjoy the sights, Pickwick did it's job in providing a clean room to relax in.

For the price ($125/night) you might expect more but considering the location its not bad. The bathroom was shared. There were two small LCD tvs next to each bunk bed and little sink with towels etc inside the room. But to shower etc you had to use a common shared washroom.All the rooms and washrooms were rather clean. This hotel is really only meant for sleepign at night, you might get claustorphobic hanging out in the rooms other than for sleeping/napping reasons. But the location is great, everything is readily within walking distance.Be careful if you're driving in, you won't get parking for less than $30 per 24 hours.Didn't see to many families at the hotel, saw mainly couples and groups of singles, and I would advise against taking kids b/c the small rooms might dirve your kids and in turn you crazy.Overall, a good hotel for a decent price in a great location.",Chicago,5,4.0

While we were originally seeking a higher-end boutique hotel, we decided to take a gamble on this one - save some money and use it towards a few 'extras'. Located conveniently on E 51 St, between 2nd & 3rd Aves in midtown, this hotel pleasantly met all our expectations.Currently under renovations (on the 3rd & 4th floors), we were given a renovated double on the 10th floor. Aptly named a ""Pod"", this room was quite similar to staying in a cruise ship cabin. Petite to the point of 'doll-like', but everything designed absolutely ergonomically! A place for everything - and everything in it's place! This room was modern in decor, with a flat screen plasma tv, and stainless steel bathroom fixtures.All of our interactions with the hotel staff were pleasant, and easy. Staff is as friendly as you can find in NY, and quick to attend to your needs. I arrived earlier than anticipated and required early check-in with no advance notice...they took care of me promptly and had me in my room within 15 minutes of arriving. The hotel is clean, and the rooms were made up promptly. The lobby is under renovation and leaves something to be desired, but we weren't in NY to hang out in a lobby. The location is very convenient to both subways, buses, restaurants, shopping and a brisk walk to Times Square. As others have mentioned, the rooms are VERY SMALL, but we felt quite safe and cozy and it also motivated us to get out and about in the mornings!If you need a litte peace and quiet from the city, on the same block there is a wonderful hidden park where you can sit with your coffee or lunch and listen to a fabulous waterfall drown out all the city sounds. Also, on the same street there is a great wine and tapas bar called the ""De-Vine Bar"" - their tapas and wine selections are top notch - really this is a hidden gem...The only drawbacks worth mentioning are; the hotel walls are thin, and the wireless internet access is beyond slow. (Go to Starbucks one block away and enjoy a latte while you work).If you are seeking a safe and affordable NY hotel alternative, this is definately worth a try. We plan on staying again next year - hopefully the prices will remain as affordable once the renovations are complete!","Ft.Lauderdale, Florida",28,4.0

Now the best thing about this hotel is its location. It is a short walk to 5th Ave, it’s not hard at all to get to Time Square, and there are a lot of little restaurants on the same street of the hotel! If you want to brave the Subway there is a stop right there on the street but let’s face it, New York is a city of walkers, so by the end of the day all you want to do it lie down and rest your feet! And the Pickwick is perfect for that. You don’t need a lot of floor space when you are so tired you can hardly move. I loved the bathroom in this place! It was very modern and always clean.

At first, I was shocked at how small the room was. The entire room was about 7x14, which is about half the size of my master bathroom at home.As the week went on, it kind of grew on me. Despite the size, the room was quite functional. The couch doubled as a bed, with a flat screen TV on the wall at the foot of the bed/couch. The sink was small, but that left room to set toiletries next to it.The public areas of the hotel were very hot, like there was no air conditioning. By the time I made it down the short hall, down the elevator, and to the front door each day, I was sweating profusely. The A/C in the room was fine, although it didn't cool the room evenly. It was cold where the air was blowing (by the bed) and slightly warm at the opposite end of the room (the bathroom).It was conveniently located a block and a half from two different subway stops (51st and Lexington and 53rd and 3rd Avenue), and I found that to be a wonderful way to get around town. $24 for a 1-week pass is unbeatable compared to cabs, rental cars, parking, etc. It was quick and I felt safe as well.The Internet connection was a bit hit and miss. Usually, it was about 150k, which is several times faster than dialup. Once, it was about 2k, which was miserably slow. Another time, it was about 800k. It's about what I would expect for ""free"".The construction wasn't a problem. I never heard a thing. The elevator did stop on one floor that was under construction and I saw the work being done briefly. The hot water was shut off for two hours one day, with about 24 hours advance notice. They seemed to do a good job keeping the construction isolated from the guests.The Pod room I was in looked freshly refurbished. The tile work in the bathroom was very nice. Everything was clean and new, except one of the back pillows on the bed/couch had a rust stain on it. Housekeeping did an adequate but not exceptional job.One concierge was helpful in suggesting which subway to take, but another suggested that they arrange transportation because the subway wasn't safe (or was it because they get a kickback?).I would stay there again if I couldn't find a really good deal on a nicer hotel, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay there again.",Texas,53,3.0

The room was small, but decorated in a cute, hip way. It reminded me of a cruise-ship cabin (there was even a flat-screen television). Though it was small, the size was fine for a single traveler. This room did not have a toilet or a shower, though they do have more expensive rooms with these facilities. The room was clean, and the shared bathrooms appeared to be cleaned several times a day.

I stayed in a pod room with a set of bunk beds. the rooms are indeed small but very clean and modern. the decor has an Ikea feel to it and it makes you think you're staying on an ocean liner. The bathrooms, which are plentiful on each floor, are also very clean. the location of the hotel is great, right at 51st and 2nd ave which is close to the UN and is a really nice trendy neighbourhood. lots of restaurants and pubs in the area and a vibrant nightlife scene. I felt very safe in this area at all times. Back to the hotel, the rooms have a safe which is big enough for a laptop which was great. the bellman is really good as is the rest of the staff. only complaint would be against the guy who they get to drive people to the airport, he was a grumpy old man. only complaint i have with this hotel is the banging doors. to get the door to lock properly you kind of have to slam it and the hallway is a huge echo chamber so there is lots of banging going on.....uh you know what i mean. luckily i had ear plugs so i was able to get some sleep. i don't know what the management of the hotel could do to correct this problem. even with this problem i would be tempted to stay there again because the location was so fantastic and the price was reasonable.as for bed bugs.

I did not have a big problem with noise from neighbors like the other postings.I should say that when I arrived, the water was turned off from 12pm-4:30pm due to renovations.

Obviously the owners know they have to charge a lot less due to their conditions.I have stayed with this hotel on 4 different occations.

It just occurred to me to write a review so people know what they're in for. I initially was quite pleased when I entered the Pickwick Arms to check-in, as the lobby is nicely decorated and clean. But within minutes I was regretting my hotel choice. From some other reviews it sounds like they have renovated a few of the rooms. The one I stayed in, though, was truly awful. It had a sink and a mirror with a shared bathroom/shower down the hall, which I was not told when I booked it through Priceline. OK, fine, I've stayed in many hostels in my life and can cope. But the tiny room was musty, smelled like chewing tobacco and was dimly lit. I literally laughed when I entered, because I felt like I took a time warp to the 1970s. The TV - not that it's that important - was from like the 1970s and even had one of those knobs that you turn to change the channels. The sink was dirty and the carpet was very worn. I couldn't help but feel depressed whenever I was in the room. I could hear everything going on in the hallway, which actually wasn't too bad considering the hotel was almost empty - and with good reason. As for the bathrooms, I can only say that they are like closets and are similar to what you'd fine in youth hostels.Maybe some of the rooms are nice, but be very careful if you decide to stay here. I wouldn't again even if it was free. Seriously. The only good thing about it is the location.","Denver, Colorado",15,1.0

Our floor had two bathrooms, each with a shower, sink and toilet. No one was ever in the bathrooms when we wanted to use them (at night or in the mid-morning.) We also had a sink in our room so we could brush our teeth, etc. The rooms are very, very small but clean with a Swedish modern feel. The only thing that we didn't like is that we could hear the loud clicking of other rooms doors whenever someone came in. We stuffed towels under our door to help with the noise so bring your earplugs.

We stayed in one of the newly refurbished ""pod"" rooms - these rooms have been totally stripped and re-equipped with very modern styled beachwood furnishings and chrome fittings, with flatscreen LCD TV and CD/Radio Alarm clock. The only warning I have is that these rooms are great for a ""couple"", but not suitable for a pair of friends - the rooms are very compact and the shower and toilet area is quite ""open"" to the bedroom area. Having said that, the shower is great and fresh towels and toiletries are provided each day. We had a great view from our 14th floor, air-conditioned room.The corridors are quite narrow and dark, but we didnt tend to hang around in the corridors.The reception staff were friendly and efficient, the final bill was exactly what I was quoted when I reserved the room, and we were able to leave our luggage with the porter after we checked out, until we were ready to leave the city.The hotel is in a great location, 10 minutes brisk walk from Grand Central, 15 minutes to Central Park, and plenty of shops, bars and restaurants.

I opted for a shared bathroom and at a rate of $79.00 per night, plus taxes, it was a pretty good deal (at the current UK exchange rate of $1.85 to the pound it came in at just under £50.00 per night). The hotel had its good points and its bad points. On the plus side the room was a decent size (although I don’t think all single rooms were as big as mine – I sneaked a look when the cleaner was in a couple of others). The bed was comfortable, the room was very clean, there was good wardrobe and drawer space and overall I felt quite comfortable and safe. On the down side the heater/ air conditioning unit was a bit temperamental and I couldn’t always get heat out of it (not that I needed to very often as it was a fairly warm week). The unit was also hanging off the wall on one side and resting on the floor, which wasn’t good. The plug plunger thing in the sink also broke twice whilst I was there and I had to screw it back in. One of the walls was slightly stained with what looked like red wine and the carpets, curtains and TV all looked pretty old and in need of replacing. Now on to the bathrooms – on the plus there were three bathrooms and two toilets in close proximity to my room, which were always available when I needed them. However, the bathrooms were not nice. The first was a just a tiny shower unit that even someone as slim as me had trouble fitting into – I didn’t use this because the door wouldn’t shut let alone lock. The second bathroom was a bath with a shower over it – the bath was awful – the enamel was all scratched off and it was black, although I think this was due to wear as it had obviously been cleaned but was still uninviting and the shower unit didn’t work properly. Onto bathroom number three – again a bath with a shower over it. Again the bath was badly marked and the enamel was scratched off but not as badly as the first one but the bath had no plug so I had to go up a floor and down a floor to find a plug, which I finally did and used this bathroom. The bathrooms on the other two floors that I saw didn’t look much better either. So although I was satisfied with the bedroom, the bathrooms did let the place down and were in bad need of replacement. I had read bad things about the staff but on the few occasions I had to speak with them (checking in, checking out and getting back into my room after I locked myself out) they seemed pleasant and helpful. The two bellhop men seemed a bit surly but did their jobs. I agree with the comment about the extortionate phone rates – I had to phone home to England and my phone card has ran out so I used the phone in the room – I was honestly only on for one minute maximum and the call cost $8.00 – I might as well have bought another $10.00 phone card!! The location was great- just 20 minutes walk from Times Square, a short walk from the subway and with plenty of places to get food near by – either to eat in or to take away. I found a great little deli called Azure just on the corner of 51st Street and 3rd Avenue. Overall for the price I couldn’t really complain and I really only slept there anyway as I was out all day. Would I stay there again?? – I would look for somewhere else first but if I couldn’t get a good price in a good location then I would stay there again.","England, UK",10,3.0

Due to something called ""Shopper's Weekend"" in the city, none of my usual hotels had availability. I opted for the Pickwick Arms because of itsgood location (51st st. between 2 and 3) and because it was just aboutthe only affordable hotel in the city available on-line when I booked,which was two months in advance! I looked at the previous reviews, and thought they weren't toobad on balance, so I gave it a try. Yikes. Beware the Pickwick Arms. I travel a lot and all over the world, and never have I received suchrude service. It began when I checked in and was asked to sign a reservation form which had a rate that was $10 per night higher than the rate I had booked online, at their own hotel website (---------------------), i.e., not a hotel website!! They even tried to argue with me that ""our rates are subject to change without notice.""I luckily produced the email reservation receipt, and insisted on therate, and they agreed. The second offense was that my window lock was broken. WhenI called to the front desk to inquire about a repair or another room,a hotel employee named Craig replied to my request with thesnappy answer, ""Don't worry, Spiderman won't be coming fora visit!"" Funny, maybe from a friend, but certainly not from a so-calledcustomer service rep. He then proceeded to inform me thathe could change me to another room, but 80% of the windows havebroken locks. Isn't that comforting? Finallly a supposed manager intervened, and the lock was ""Fixed"" by a maintenance man (who did arrive promptly) - fix meant it wasjimmied shut, so my choice was a permanently locked window(which I chose) or a non-functional window. The location of the Pickwick is excellent - two blocks to subway, and many restaurants around. The room is the size of a postage stamp,but that's to be expected. I suppose if you have a tough skinand want to experience the rudeness that can give New Yorkers theirstereotype, then go to Pickwick Arms.

The hotel lobby is immaculately decorated and has a nice atmosphere and the corridors on the various floors of the hotels are also nicely decorated. The room that I booked was basic but comfortable and I had requested my own private bathroom which was both clean and convenient. The cleaning staff had not bothered to empty the garbage bag in my room prior to my arrival and the water temperature in the bathroom fluctuated between being scalding hot and freezing cold but otherwise the room was quite a good deal. The demeanor of the hotel staff needs improvement -while one or two were courteous and friendly, the others were rude and even hostile and made no effort to be hospitable or friendly. The restaurant connecting on from the hotel was both overpriced and did not provide the best service but there are several good restauruants nearby. All in all this is a good deal and is conveniently located in the city, but there are one or two areas where the hotel can improve significantly",NSW Australia,3,3.0

The room was very small and austere, but comfortable and clean. The shower up the hall was spotless but very tiny - walk in and back out. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was first rate. It was a quiet safe neighbourhood near all the major attractions and transportation. For $79 a night Canadian - how could I complain. I only used the room to sleep in anyway. And I didn't see any naked people walking up the hall - as one reviewer put it. I will definitely stay there again.","New Brunswick, Canada",3,5.0

We arrived at this hotel on a very warm (80ish) early October evening to find the lobby, and corridors, of this hotel are not air conditioned. The rooms are so small there are no accommodations for suitcases or valet items. NO WALKING ROOM, WHAT SO EVER!! We found someone elses shoes (a previous occupant of the room) under our bed. It gives an indication of their poor cleaning of the rooms. The desk staff are extremely rude and acted haughty. When I brought it to their attention, they became MORE RUDE! I couldn't leave here fast enough!! Don't waste your money here~",,13,1.0

I was in New York on business, and found myself in one of the tiny shared shower rooms. Everything was pretty basic, but there was air con, and the showers were clean - although it was best to get in there early rather than later. The staff were helpful to me and, despite what another reviewer said, the place was clean (well, clean enough for me). If you go expecting a cheap, functional hotel then you won't be disappointed. The location is perhaps the best feature of the place - $70 dollars for a room in midtown is fantastic. The decor might not be great, buts its quiet and seems to attract regular people.Not great, then, but good enough.","Norwich, England",1,3.0

Lobby and building front are quite upscale and impressive. Shared bath rooms can be had for about $70 on the internet, and while small are clean and acceptable. A handfull of bathrooms are located throughout each floor, and while small, they were very clean. I'm usually quite particular about things like that, but I have to admit it's actually a pretty good setup. We use shared baths at work and at the gym dont we..... For me, it's a ridiculously good value in central Manhattan.","Los Angeles, CA",2,4.0

The staff is unfriendly, it's shocking to see naked people wrapped in towels walking to the ""public baths"" , the rooms are sorry as can be, etc. The only good feature is it is in midtown and the location is good. Let me relate a quick story: My wife is wheelchair bound. As we prepared to leave I was securing her wheelchair in the van that we drove to N.Y. and the doorman came and told us to ""move on"". Explained that we had been guests and were just preparing to leave and he threatened us with calling a cop if we didn't move on. He left us alone after I threatened him with violence but the impression of the staff was fixed. If you have VERY low standards, by all means stay at the Pickwick Arms. And good luck.

Not the ones that my friend and I had! The location may be great but the rooms were horrid. We had a room each and shared an interconnecting shower-room. If doing this, you'd better be prepared to hear every noise from the tiny toilet/shower cubicle and for your every noise to be heard. There was no fan, heater, kettle or even clock in the old-fashioned, gloomy, tiny 10'x8' room. When I first saw it I felt like crying! I know it was a tourist class hotel but surely there must be some basic standards. Most definitely I would not stay in this hotel again.",UK,4,1.0

There is a particularly welcome public open space opposite, with tropical foliage creating a cool and shady place to enjoy a coffee from the snack kiosk, or a take away from the excellent deli on the corner of 51st. The foyer and halls look smart - the room however (a single with shared bath in this case) was small and in serious need of a lick of paint - it did not represent particularly good value. The hotels' two restaurants are trendy and loud of an evening (although this did not filter through to the room) You can get a pleasant but somewhat expensive breakfast at one of them - this is not included in the tariff. And as for the advertised roof garden, well don't get too excited - it's a few plastic patio chairs on a concrete square. The tiny bedroom's air conditioning was a much more attractive proposition on a hot Summer's night.",,0,3.0
