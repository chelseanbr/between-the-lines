Figures, both political & cultural, played out some of their lives at such hotels, with some there when world-altering events occurred. Rudy Giuliani was to hear about the events of 9/11 while at The Peninsula a good few of us are still familiar with lines of soccer star superstar, George Best, delivered while living at The Savoy.I have visited both a good few times & was lucky enough to be treated to a weekend end at The lPeninsula, when traveling through NYC on a trip from Oxford to Vancouver both ways in September 2002, a year .of commemoration after 9/11. Everything about The Peninsula ie truly wonderful.The location on 5th Ave at 55th signals its singularity.Right in the center of midtown NYC, it is in a prime position for important venues like The Roosevelt Centre & it is also well located for fine dining & good shopping. The bar & lounge is terrific with good service & food & drinks, as is the roof top bar & patio dining .  In fact , there was great service right across the hotel & both my nights at 5/55 were just wonderful. With all which was wonder that weekend, swimming in its roof top pool looking over 5th Ave & 55th street, topped it allI love swimming & have swam almost anywhere at a drop of a hat. Swimming high above NYC in the Peninsula’s pool is one of my favorite swimming experiences in my swimming life, which has stretched out over some 50 years, five continents & 58 counties. It is up there in my in my top five pools around the world.The Peninsula also has a very enlightened “pet” policy, allowing pets to stay with their owners,Our Buddhist dog, Riley P Fuller, was an enthusiastic traveller & bon vivant. The Peninsula was just Riley’s kind off place, as is NYC.In fact, a stay at The Peninsula was on his bucket list.If he were here now, he would’ eagerly be awaiting The Peninsula’s reopening.Posted by S Fuller","Vancouver, Canada",18,5.0

Often you pay a premium price for a mediocre experience. Here you pay a premium price and feel that the promise was delivered. The staff is incomparable. Every touch makes you feel special - including (maybe especially) housekeeping, room service, bellmen - right down the line!While I am happy to rave about our experience at the hotel, I need to add that the rooftop bar is a separate animal. We visited on multiple occasions and always felt that we entered the real New York. The one where the staff doesn't care and you are on your own in the concrete jungle - but still paying a premium price.Having shared the negative, I want to end by saying we loved our stay at The Peninsula and will be back whenever in NYC.","palm beach, fl",32,5.0

The rooftop Salon is one of the finest places to be, especially with the charming chalet offering.

As we arrived the hotel decorations on the exterior included the trademark Bellman in white. We were greeted by doormen and bellmen that gave us a welcome and took care of the luggage. The interior was also tastefully decorated . Our next stop was reception where we were welcomed by Shuma. She checked us in and then escorted us to our room. The room overlooked 5th Avenue and was nicely appointed. As one would expect linen and toweling was first class, even the hotel slippers where fluffy and comfortable. The amenities in the bathroom were Oscar de La Renta. The bath had both tub and shower and was ample size. Did I mention the view '0). It snowed a bit so we could see the flakes as it hit 5th. The midtown location is very convenient. As we were leaving we met Byron in the elevator and we struck up a friendly conversation and expected no more but he too extended the extra effort. Without being asked he took our luggage to the hotel entrance and secured a car for us. At the desk to check us out was Shuma and she was as great in bidding us farewell as she was in greeting us for out stay.What makes the Peninsula great.....their people!!!

We had stayed many times years ago and were excited to celebrate our 30th Anniversary there. A week before arriving I read a series of reviews in TripAdvisor that the hotel had fallen on disrepair and had become “tired and beat”...Worried about these reviews I emailed the hotel in advance of arriving and explained my concerns. I was promised I had nothing to worry about and that they were aware of these reviews and concerns and assured me we would receive a fresh wonderfully appointed room consistent with what was a five star hotel(please note the nightly rates are that of a five start hotel). Upon checking in our room was not ready(not a big deal) however when we returned 2 hours later and went to our room we were mortified; the room was beat, the carpet was stained, the furniture was beat up, scratched and dirty and more interesting the night stand had a hole in it. The television was so old when my wife called and asked in there was a guide in the TV, she was told it was in the table as a note card. Further, despite being told our luggage was in our room when we returned to the hotel... it turns out the luggage was misplaced and took 40 minutes to find its way to our room. This became important as we were leaving the hotel to move to a different hotel(that didn’t lie to us about the condition of the hotel)..so we ultimately sat in the room for almost an hour waiting for our lost luggage so we could in fact leave and find a new hotel. In as much as it was now 5:00pm and we had theatre tickets for 7:00pm it made for a stressful terrible first day of our anniversary trip.The a Pennisula was at one time one of the greats in NYC.

First, the good: the location is great and the check-in process was quick and friendly. But our room was uncomfortable. It was small, which wouldn't really bother me, but the bed was so hard. I woke up after the first night with back and neck aches, which is rare for me. Aside from that, the room was really loud—we kept waking up all night from the people walking above us and outside the room. Since a good night's sleep is the number one thing I want from a hotel, The Peninsula was a disappointment, especially for the price.A few smaller things: we had lunch at the restaurant. The food was okay, but it was really expensive for what it was, and we were asked if we wanted wine throughout our meal three different times by three different waiters. It felt like they kept trying to up-sell us.

For both the junior suite and executive suite, the sofa bed was needed to be opened for the period of my stay. Every morning they closed it except for two days. Every time I asked for something, for example, one time I asked for two bottles of water, two bottles of shower gel, the housekeeping would give me 6 bottles of water and 4 bottles of shampoo. It would also take them 20 mins to get the items. The housekeeping also left a stack of pillowcases in the suite one morning I don’t know for what purposes. The bathroom floor was not cleaned properly as it was brown when I wiped it when I first arrived my suite. For the superior room, the staff didn’t change one of the tissue rolls and simply just left the rod in the bathroom. The staff is supposed to refill the things that were used/exhausted but none of times were done precisely and thoroughly. The poor service has me wondering where the hotel got its 5 star from. I get it they want tips and all that but even so, shouldn’t they act more diligently and professionally? This is not what I expect from a 5-star hotel, more like 3-star quality.

The location at 55th and 5th puts you right in the center of so many of the best parts of the city. The shopping and food in the area are fantastic. Although the street is under repair and traffic is generally chaotic around there, valet parking was a surprisingly smooth experience. Staff from the doormen to the bell boys to housekeeping to the front desk and concierge were professional and friendly. Our room was great with an exceptionally large bathroom. Don't expect great views from the room as most of the rooms are down too low. But we enjoyed the view of the surrounding buildings just fine. The indoor pool is special (you can dine at the pool), as are the sundeck and fitness center. They even have a lovely herb garden in the sundeck area. The only downsides were breakfast at the 2nd floor restaurant Clement and the lack of creative cocktails at the Gotham Lounge. For breakfast, perhaps because I had kids with me, we were seated at the worst possible table despite many beautiful window tables, booths, and banquettes being open. This happens often so while I was not surprised, I was disappointed. My child is picky so we asked to just order something from one of the sets a la carte. The server was very resistant and said that was only available as part of a set. I was surprised because this is The Peninsula so I expected him to just say ""of course, no problem"". After I explained that my child is picky and that's the only thing he was willing to eat, he agreed. The food was very slow to come out, and when it did, they had forgotten some of the items. We had a lovely dinner at the Gotham Lounge--the food was great and the service friendly--but I was surprised that they do not have a cocktail list or really any signature cocktails. They had a handful of champagne cocktails they were offering, but when I told the server I don't like champagne, they said to just tell them what I wanted and they could make it. As I explained, I love trying the signature cocktails of different properties because if you ask me what I want, I'll just say something usual like a Dark & Stormy. They ended-up making me a mojito which was just ok. I strong suggest they come up with a few creative, non-champagne cocktails as this could really be an attraction to the lounge, which is a beautiful space. We were also disappointed by the Salon de Ning, as we had hoped to sit outside in the beautiful outdoor lounge space, but for whatever reason it was closed when we went at 7 p.m. and only the bar was open, which was absolutely packed with a very raucous crowd. Despite these few negative points, we loved this hotel and would stay again.",,2,4.0

Key positives include: a great location on the 5th, the rooftop bar (with view), very pleasant and large swimming pool (and spa/gym), warm & friendly staff and delicate attention for the kids (birthday cake and decoration for my son's birthday, welcome gifts, ""petting zoo"" activity in the lobby for Easter...)... One unfortunate glitch (the children's bed was not prepared one evening when coming back from dinner - and the children were tired) and a few things to be aware of: the lobby is slightly crammed/dark (I guess not much that can be done here as this is the historic layout), our room was quite small (and with an uninteresting view over an internal courtyard) and we were not impressed by the breakfast (relatively slow service, quite expensive and not necessarily as good as comparable hotels).

Drawer hinges came right off when we were looking for cups while extension wires with open sockets were velcro-ed across the bed side table making it rather odd and and not to mention, unattractive. The Concierge isn't the warmest given I've met some really amazing ones at the other smaller establishments up in Brooklyn. My new room key was left at the concierge and after a late night out, I approached the reception asking for my room keycard to which I was told I needed to show my ID.

I do have my ID with me at the moment!"" to which the staff at the desk replied with a straight face of "" NO, YOU, are in luck cause I can't give you your room keycard without an ID"" Quite frankly, I find that retort rather unnecessary.

Both are very fine, five-star properties. I expected an experience similar to that in Beverly Hills when I decided to try the Peninsula in NYC. Such was my faith in the Peninsula brand that I ignored the negative reviews and decided to give the hotel a try myself. Oops!My general assessment is that the hotel just needs to be closed for a bottom up (top down?) remodel. When you walk into the lobby the place looks nice enough but it quickly becomes clear that various parts of the lobby have been ""spruced up"" at different times resulting in a lack of cohesion that doesn't feel luxurious. The lobby area by the check in counter has all sorts of things on the wall making it look cluttered and more like a 3 or 4 star hotel. The lobby bathrooms that serve the restaurant, lounge, and two downstairs bars are atrocious. They have rusted hardware, toilet bowls that are scratched and stained, and tiles that at a minimum need polishing (see photos). Worse yet, they are the bathrooms of choice of every cabby that stops at the hotel. The mens room is always filthy.All the elevators are slow. Very slow. There is a bank of six, very dated elevators serving the 20 odd floors of hotel rooms. When I was there it seemed to me that at least one of them was down. Also, I don't think the hotel has a service elevator as you'd have to share the elevator occasionally with the bellmen. That was a very tight squeeze -- the elevator car would get crowded with just five people. It could take a while to get up to the room (or down). The elevators stop on multiple floors, which makes me think there's no priority management of the calls.The rooftop bar at the hotel was, by the looks of it, bolted on in the 1980's. The Peninsula NYC is a historic hotel (formerly the Gotham?), so adding this boxy, brown-glassed contraption to the roof is a crime against good taste. The addition doesn't attempt to blend tastefully with the building, so stylistically it's abominable. Then, there's the layout. You take a separate elevator to get there (just one, and it's slow). The elevator car has a nice addition of a Bose stereo speaker that was probably installed by a handyman. The speaker is bolted onto a crevice separation at the roof of the car for a very homemade look. The elevator itself isn't easy to find, as it's around the corner below the lobby. Perhaps this is the missing service elevator, repurposed for rooftop access? Once up at the roof, there's a snaking corridor with a number of turns in it. It must be terrible navigating this when drunk. Regardless, when you ""arrive"" at the top of a roof deck bar in a five-star hotel, shouldn't the architect be thinking about wow factor? By contrast, the hallway from the elevator to the bar feels claustrophobic. It's cluttered with some weird asian furniture likely bought on sale at Pier One Imports. The walls are painted and adorned with some little art pieces. It again doesn't tie into anything that's in the lobby below and it's dirty. When you walk into the main bar the furniture is clubby, so again, we are introduced to a new style. On the positive side, any view that doesn't have the bar in it is great. The room itself (king room) was ok. I would say it was smaller than expected, but nicely appointed. Good technology, ie light, temp controls and USB ports. The mattress was awful.Also, for the most part the service was excellent and the only reason this review gets a full three stars.In sum, don't stay here unless you're getting the deal of deals -- or if paying full freight, wait until after a major remodel.","Newport Beach, California",1,3.0

Part of what makes a great NYC hotel is whether or not one can escape the stress of the city after walking through the door. The Peninsula is a beautiful hotel and though I think it would be a mistake to compare it to a truly great hotel like the St. Regis across the street, The Peninsula makes the comparison herself in her literature and even the coffee table book in the suites. Unfortunately, for all of the grandeur of this grand hotel she simply does not live up to her potential - or her promise - of unparalleled luxury and service.It is not lost on me that it must be stressful to be a hotel worker (or anybody in the service industry) this time of year. From the insane requests (like the woman who wanted an adjoining room that was already occupied emptied so she could rent it for an afternoon to open gifts with her family on Christmas Eve) to people being simply unreasonable when it came to the room they were given (a man who bought his room on a travel website, but didn’t want to pay for an upgrade to a better view) - it is obviously difficult to work at a hotel this time of year.There are things, though, that can never be allowed to suffer simply because the hotel is nearly full, the holidays are busy, and the patrons are making unreasonable demands. I would never ‘grade’ a hotel stay based on anything other than the service I receive and the product offered. Similarly, I would expect any hotel I stay to never allow it to get to the point that a review is necessary to have the hotel live up to its own standards.Like all hotel stays, there are hiccups along the way. Things happen when people are spending an extended period of time away from home, but there are unforgivable sins in the hospitality industry, especially in hospitality that compares itself to the St. Regis - one of the finest hotels in the world. We have stayed at two other Peninsula hotels in the world and though I will not compare The Peninsula to the St. Regis across the street, I think it more than fair to compare Peninsula brands and by any measure, The Peninsula New York failed in almost every way.Similar to all hotel stays and hiccups, there are always hotel employees that are unsung heroes of stays. In the case of The Peninsula New York, those employees work for housekeeping and room service. Almost everything they did was good and though there were issues related to communication with them (not that I could not communicate with them, rather that hotel staff did not seem to talk to each other) by and large they did a good job.There are a few things that must be worked on by the hotel’s best assets and above all else must be the end of the yelling in the hallways during service. Although we could not hear the housekeeping staff in the hallways in the bedroom, we could hear them in the living room and it is distracting beyond belief. There is no reason the housekeeping staff should be shouting at one another. Most hotel staff members are issued radios or cell phones, but Peninsula staff members seem to use the old fashioned art of yelling or talking loudly in the halls to communicate with one another. It’s distracting and unnecessary.Another issue we found was inconsistency with room service. Some things were good, but there were days when information given to us differed from information previous days. For instance, one morning I ordered a continental breakfast and very specifically asked if the pastries were baked in-house. I was assured they are (there really is nothing worse than store-bought pastries), but when they arrived the room service attendant told me they were not made by the pastry chef at all and were simply purchased and warmed here. It would not be a big deal, but I asked about them a couple days later and was told something different by the room service staff. The pastry chef either bakes pastries or they do not. Both things cannot be true at the same time, especially for the low quality of the baked goods and the fact that the bakery items are priced quadruple what they are a couple blocks away at Bouchon.Now to issues that the hotel must correct because they directly impact first impressions and continued impressions during a stay.I have never stayed at a hotel whose front of house staff were as dismissive and absent as those here at The Peninsula New York. It was our driver from the airport who asked a question that would last throughout our visit, “Where are the bellman?” As we arrived we sat in the car from the airport for a few minutes waiting for somebody to show up to greet us. It isn’t that we didn’t want to get out of the car - it was that there was nobody to help us. We waited for more than a few minutes and eventually somebody came. I chalked their absence up to the hotel being busy because it was days before Christmas, but as I soon learned, it was a systemic problem that was never to be corrected.On multiple occasions I went to the front of the hotel to get a cab and there was no doorman. ONE particular doorman always went above and beyond to get us a cab to go wherever we were going, but that was the exception and not the rule. As a rule, the bell staff was absent from the front of the hotel and there were days when I used an app or went to Fifth Avenue to get a cab myself. One day we went out to get a cab to dinner and there was one doorman on duty. He blew his whistle a few times and forgot about us. Cars with guests were arriving and they experienced the same thing we did: nobody to greet or help us. Drivers were asking the same question our driver asked and people were piling up in the front of the building. There were Peninsula employees watching this chaos unfold, but they were IN the hotel looking out - at no point did any of them decide to contact somebody to say the front of the hotel was chaotic.Finally, I did something I’d never done before: I called the hotel and asked for the front desk (we passed the desk some 20-minutes earlier on our way out) to send somebody outside to help us. Hotel employees soon rushed outside from all directions (noticeably absent from the scrum were actual bellman/doormen), but eventually employees outnumbered guests - which is how it should have been from the start.The front desk staffer that brought the cab to me said he apologized for the wait and I remarked how strange it was to have one bellman disappear only to leave guests requiring assistance, arriving guests, and departing ones on their own. His response was telling, “It is rush hour so things get busy.” I asked him what that had to do with the absence of staff, but there were a lot of other people around and he just mumbled something. I don’t know what he said, but it was the biggest sign of a crack in the shine of The Peninsula New York.From dinner that night I called the hotel and asked that my room be turned down. The person who answered the phone said she would pass the message to housekeeping and I was looking forward to a nice shower and bed. Unfortunately, the message never got to housekeeping and I had to call down for somebody to turn down the room. It took longer than it should have (waiting for the staff) and it was just another example of people in the hotel not talking to each other and lacking communication. It is not fair to compare one hotel to another, I know, but there were a great number of failures that happened at The Peninsula that did not have to happen due to people either not talking to each other or not talking about guest needs to one another.I could go on about the bell staff and the absence of the staff that are there to ensure guests have what they need, but there is something about having to track help down that bothers me. It is not like I am asking for anything that is not promised, but none of these kinds of issues happen at other Peninsula properties.Not only is the lack of communication between staff a problem for the hotel, but also communication between guests and the hotel is problematic. Consider something simple like getting shoes shined - something one would think would be second nature to a place where bags are provided for that purpose. One night the shoes were not returned and we found them at the room we spent our first night, another night our shoes were never picked up and we were going to an event the day we needed them and when I asked how long it would take I was told it could be up to overnight. I had them shined across the street, but sent another pair down just to have them the day before I needed them. This is something simple not complicated, but a change in room should never create a situation where guests decide to take it upon themselves to go searching for shoes that should have been hanging on the door the next morning. I guess I should be glad that the people ultimately assigned to the room we left after our first day woke late and didn’t decide that my shoes would be good for them.One day the hotel sent some wine to the room to apologize to us for some reason or another and we told the person who brought it that we do not drink. After we moved rooms the wine ended up in the new room we were assigned. I told the housekeeper that we do not drink and do not need the wine (it was being wasted on us) and she said that she would send room service to get it. A couple of days later it was still there and I called reception to let them know that we did not drink (they did not know it, but it was for not other reason than we just don’t drink, not because it is a temptation beyond any other) and it was not removed for days. When the wine finally went away it should have been replaced with a fruit bowl or something, not just taken away days later and re-gifted to somebody else noticing all the small things that were really problematic during their stay. I realize that the “issues” we faced at The Peninsula New York were undoubtedly first world problems, but when one is paying thousands of dollars a night to sleep somewhere for a long period of time there is an expectation that the hotel deliver what it promises. The Peninsula promises a five star experience that makes staying here similar to the St. Regis (a place it compares itself to), but the stays are not similar at all. There is part of me that says it is harsh to talk badly about a place that was your home for the holidays, but then again, I’m a Hanukkah guy not a Christmas one so it’s not really my holiday. I understand that people and hotels get busy, but you must be prepared for the busy season and you cannot simply count on guests being distracted by things in the hotel hoping that people will overlook the shortcomings.Whether or not we stay at The Peninsula New York again I am not sure. One thing I am sure about is that if you are looking for a place that is elegant and does Christmas well, The Peninsula New York certainly fits that bill. Rooms are lovely and there are nice touches for the holidays - like the Christmas tree and decorations in our room. What you should know is that if you are looking for service over anything else, this may not be the best place for you. If you are familiar with Peninsula brands in China, Hong Kong, Beverly Hills, or elsewhere, I’m not sure your expectations will be met here. The fact that they cannot communicate simple instructions to one another is a big problem. Add to that the number of problems compounded by the days we stayed and you have an eventful stay with little things that kept adding up. The people here mean well - of that there is no doubt - but either The Peninsula went with its B and C teams over the holidays or they have a young staff that is not used to being near capacity during the holidays.We appreciated our time here and we are thankful for their hospitality, but they really must do better if they are going to compare themselves to the true grand dames of New York hotels. I’m just sorry that things didn’t go as well as I would have liked - I liked and we enjoyed the understated elegance of The Peninsula and I only wish their staff would have put as much effort into making the stay a good one as we did in our desire for it to be an uneventful one without problems.","Los Angeles, California",36,3.0

However this time it was and is in need of a lot of changes. First, when I go to NYC for business which is often I always ask for a room no view on a quiet street, well that did not happen. Then the toilet was leaking all over the place. So they did not move me to an upgraded room, ( BTW this hotel is notorious for telling its Centurion guests that they dont have any available upgrades). I have complained to Centurion about this hotel in the past not abiding by its AMEX contract but that goes nowhere. So they take to another room that is the size of a matchbox and I turn it down and tell them to fix the toilet and go out for dinner. So I come back and the toilet is till leaking, i call done again and have to wait for another engineer to fix it and it’s now around 10:30 at night. They finally fix it and the next thing is the furnishings are dated and in need of replacement they have been like this for over a decade. The hotel is very busy and noisy and has a lot of other issues too many to go over. So if you are looking for a luxury hotel try The Lowell, The baccarat or the towers at Lotte Place ","Casares, Spain",60,3.0

The Hotel and its rooms are in beautiful shape, particularly with the Christmas decorations, and is located in the perfect NYC location, right off 5th Ave. Every night the hotel had Christmas carolers at the entrance, including singers from the Jersey Boys broadway show. The rooftop bar has a beautiful view of the City, as does the 21st floor pool, gym and spa, and the Gotham Lounge is a great spot to relax.But, it is the Hotel staff that truly made the experience exceptional, particularly the asst manager Giovanni Fillichio. Giovanni went out of his way to welcome us, giving us a tour of the hotel and amenities, and always available to point out a restaurant or NYC attraction to try, arranging for transportation, or just a seat at the Gotham lounge. It seemed as if we paused in the lobby for more than a couple minutes, Giovanni was there to make sure everything was going well, arrange transportation, or to give directions or assistance. The rest of the staff we encountered seem to follow Giovanni's example - they were outstanding in every way. We had breakfast served in our room twice. The gentlemen that served is was as polite, friendly and accommodating as possible. Same for the bartenders that would serve up a nightcap to go up to the room at the end of the day.

The Gotham bar is fantastic- especially Diego the bartender and the table server- Conrado - he has been there a long time! Great place to relax especially at the end of a long day of walking and subways. The gym is one of my favorites with the spectacular views, large size and plenty of equipment. They have an oversized aerobic room, outdoor sitting area is you want to just enjoy a rest after or even coffee and tea via Nespresso machine. Entire housekeeping staff is friendly and helpful. The in room dining team is spot on with service and food. The doorman are delightful and always available to help. Best Location A MUST STAY!!!",Boca Raton,37,5.0

The check in went smooth, my room was upgraded. The people working at the desk were very nice, friendly etc... The room....I’ve stayed at the Peninsula Chicago many times and I guess I was expecting the same caliber (hadn’t read the TA reviews beforehand, my bad). Furniture was shabby, nightstand hinges were loose. Had to unplug other things for chargers. And NO Nespresso in the room. Was really hoping for that. Other than those things, the room was fine. Bathroom was roomy. I just thought there would be more brand consistency. The location was great, close to Central Park, walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. The spa is beautiful with excellent service. The bar/restaurant was nice, food was good. The only place I thought service was lacking was at the front door. In Chicago they always greet, get the door etc....here i was basically ignored every time i came in, until I walked by the front desk. Just another difference I noticed and was again, surprised by the inconsistency. I’m on the fence whether I would stay again, the Langham looked pretty inviting and more consistent with their Chicago location.","ann arbor, michigan",5,4.0

The hotel was full so we were unable to get an upgrade, although one was offered we did not bother to inspect as we were tired from a long international journey, and were told that the alternative was not much better. Peninsula must upgrade to maintain the wonderful reputation that the brand enjoys.

Last 3 times in NY we’ve stayed at the Ritz. Had two rooms- kids had a room with two queens and we were initially in a junior suite. Our card allows for upgrades when possible and they actually bumped us 2x to a grand executive suite. Separate living room and very spacious. Kids room was the same- very spacious. Bathrooms didn’t disappoint either. Everything was super clean and felt new as compared to some of the other 5 stars we’ve stayed at. Had a view of 5th ave which was nice. Had breakfast and evening drinks at the hotel and it was excellent. They have a main bar / restaurant and they have a lounge area with oversized couches and comfortable chairs. Kids enjoyed the snacks and appetizers. They have a rooftop bar that is pretty cool also. Took a swim in the pool one afternoon with the kids- not a place you’d go because of the pool but it was a treat to have one. Kids like being across the street from the park, and this is a few blocks away. But, this was a nice change as it is closer to most of the shopping and a little closer to the shows. It’s hard to complain about the prices when they upgrade you like they did us, but the food and drinks were a little pricey, even compared to some of the other places we’ve stayed. The staff that checked us in was awesome, and in general all the staff were very polite. I did catch a bit of a rude vibe from a couple of the staff but sometimes people have bad days.

Great location and front of house staff who really want to please you. The room itself was large, very clean and the bed was very comfortable.

The hotel felt dated and in certain areas absolutely not 5 star - the pool area was closed but that was no big deal and did not affect our opinion as it looked dated and small. Gym was ok but not great. £700 a night in Europe buys you the absolute top notch - this felt like a 4 star hotel trying to keep up. Come on guys - the competition is fierce these days and shabby areas and lifts and carpets that have seen better days do not command £700 a night.

The reviews that I wrote are usually on a positive note where I carefully notate my interactions with staff, experiences on property, etc. On this particular visit, immediately upon checking in, I walked into a whirlwind of negativity. As the female (her name escaped me) at the front desk gretted us, there was a gentleman on the opposite side of her who was dealing with an extremely irate guest/guest representative. I mean this lady was yelling at the top of her lungs going on and on about how it’s complete bulls*** that they made her come to the desk to pay for the room because they couldn’t take her card number over the phone. The gentleman was very mild mannered and politely explained to her that it was company policy. Her response was “oh that’s a load of crap”. She kept pushing at the fact that she is “sick with cancer” and they “made her” come to the front desk to pay, etc. The gentleman apologized and did his best to placate her. She stated that she was paying for the room for the actress Nia Long, I can only assume that this woman must’ve been part of the booking company because I don’t understand how such an unprofessional person could be representing such a well-known actress in this manner. She proceeded to name the company and when the gentleman told her the total for the room (including taxes) she went on another tangent stating that they “don’t pay taxes” and that he HAS to give her “a better price” and questioned why the second night was more expensive than the first. This woman was so loud and so obnoxious. The fact that I know all of these details speaks to the fact of how loud she was being. After completing check-in, the young lady walked us to the elevator and I asked her the name of the gentleman at the desk (whom I now knew to be Nicholas). The young lady asked if everything was ok and I said yes. After being in the room for about ten minutes or so, I received a phone call from the front desk; it was Nicholas. He called to see if we were settled in and to also apologize for the commotion upon check-in. This was something he most certainly did not have to do. He went out of his way to call and apologize, for HER actions! I thanked him and told him that he handled the situation very well and that someone’s illness gives them absolutely not right to belittle him and be so disrespectful. Needless to say, this was a true display of how well staff receives training here as well as the quality of the individuals employed. Moving on....Our room was number 2006 and it was quite comfortable and welcoming. There was even a nice welcome note left on the desk. The bathroom was spacious and housekeeping always kept everything tidy. They have a state of the art gym with all the bells and whistles (the view of the city from there isn’t bad either). The rooftop bar/lounge is simply divine. You have the option of sitting inside or outside. I’d sit outside on a nice night if I were you. Fun note: I always know little fun facts about the places I visit and sometimes I asks staff questions to see if the know the answers. I asked the bellman why the restaurant was named ‘Clement’, and to my surprise, he actually knew that it was named after the CEO of the Peninsula hotel chain. Kudos to him! This was an interesting fact that my husband and I learned when we met the CEO on a prior vacation in the Caribbean.","Miami, Florida",34,5.0

Based on those experiences, which were all amazing, I went into this visit in Manhattan with high expectations. We decided to book this hotel for a last minute trip to NYC for my birthday. That all said, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Peninsula New York delivered 110%.Room:Our room was very large. It had an amazing king size bed with luxiorious down pillows, down comforter and extremely comfortable mattress. It was so quiet. Having stayed in other NYC hotels, noise always seems to be an issue. Our room at the Peninsula, was beyond quiet. You could hear a pin drop. The bathroom feels like a spa. Marble everywhere, large walk-in shower with multiple shower heads, separate soaking tub, and separate commode with private door. The room has many places to store all your clothes, a large hanging closet and plentiful wet bar.Clement Restaurant:We ate here for breakfast daily. Each day I had the Maine lobster with kale, heirloom tomatoes, poached eggs and freshly squeezed beet and carrot juice. The service is impeccable. Everyone of the waiters is top notch. You'd be hard pressed to find a better place to start the day.Spa:We used the spa daily. The pool is amazing. Located on the 22nd floor. You are literally swimming amongst skyscapers. The steam room and sauna provided a nice respite after spending time in the hustle and bustle of the streets of Manhattan. Salon de Ning:This is a top-notch rooftop bar. The views are amazing and the drinks and food are delicious. You pay to play here no doubt but it's worth it 100%Overall building condition:This hotel is celebrating its 30th year. The overall condition of the public areas, hallways and rooms are excellent. Sure there are areas that need some attention but that is true of every hotel.Staff:This is where the Peninsula absolutely shines. A luxury hotel that employs staff that look after their guests makes the visit amazing every time. We had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with the general manager, Jonathan Crook as well as the front office manager, Hannah Heyer. Obviously the leadership of this Peninsula are doing right things because these two individuals ensured a perfect visit for us. Every other staff member we met delivered service in a similar exemplary style. The staff in each area of the hotel was warm, friendly, accommodating, and a lovely representation of the brand.

We were given a complimentary upgrade to a 5th Avenue view room, and for that I was very grateful. Inconsistency was my main issue with not having a more memorable trip, and for not giving a higher rating. There were services that were missed the first night, but were offered the second (like turn down service, or bucket of ice) - which were not a huge deal, but left me feeling that maybe something was overlooked the first night? The thermostat and the volume on the bathroom TV were not working, but were fixed when I brought to the front desk's attention the next morning. Again, bathroom TV volume was not a huge deal, but one of those nice touches that ""would have been nice"" and in character with what I had perceived to be part of the Peninsula branding. I had a small child with me that thoroughly enjoyed having that feature the second night, so while we were grateful for the fix, part of me feels it should have been working for both nights. A working thermostat was more important, as we did not have heat - we were FREEZING!The remote control also was barely working, though not sure if that was because of the batteries or if it was the age of the TV system - looks and feels very clunky and dated. Did not bother bringing that to the staff's attention, but adds to a general (surprisingly) dumpy feel for such a well-regarded hotel. The details were noticed, and did not seem in line with the average $1000/night pricepoint. There is nothing negative for me to share, but it did feel ""mediocre"" for their quality tier. If you are out and about sightseeing, it will be fine for you to come back to this hotel and rest in their beautiful surroundings. We are locals who wanted a more hotel-based getaway, so were more reliant on the in-room features than perhaps other visitors might be, so please factor that as well in processing our comments. Overall we had a good stay. Staff was always pleasant. Issues that were brought to their attention were rectified in one or two phone calls the next day. I would have been very ok to not receive an upgrade but to have a room in working order",NYC,11,3.0

Here’s the story. My wife wanted to take her 9 year old granddaughter to the ABT ballet for her birthday. We saw the afternoon tea which is related to the ballet and Espie (the granddaughter) was super excited to do this as well. We called to reserve a spot then booked the ballet for the same day. Yesterday morning, they texted my wife to confirm. All set except we get a phone message 2 hours later saying that had to cancel because they booked another event instead. While we planned our day around the tea and coming in from Rhode Island, we can understand that things happen but the way we were treated as we attempted to speak to someone went like this; After being shifted and transferred numerous times then hung up on, we finally got someone on the phone who basically told us unapologetically that we were out of luck because they booked “a better event”. Now I’m the first to acknowledge that a $60 a person afternoon tea doesn’t carry much weight when you charge $600 a night for a room but you would think a hotel of this stature would offer some form of reasonable customer service and/or some form of offer to remedy the matter. AND we were told we would get a call right back to speak to the food and service manager. No call...I vent because there’s nothing worse than disappointing a 9 year old girl on her birthday. She probably would’ve enjoyed the tea more than the ballet. ","Trumbull, Connecticut",21,1.0

I understand that they could be busy but I felt that they were understaffed and this is the second arrival that no one came to greet me.2: I have sleep apnea and use a Cpap machine therefore I need an outlet to plug my machine into.One would think that a five star hotel would have an outlet next to the bed to charge ur phone etc, however the Peninsula does not.My last stay I had the same issue, and I informed the hotel twice before my stay and confirmed upon check in to make sure their is an extension cord in my room.I get up to my room at about 1130pm and low and behold there is no extension cord, sure enough someone came up to set it up, but at 1130 pm coming back to the room tired, u want to go to sleep and not have to deal with this.3: I asked the Conceirge if the house Car would be available half an hour bf I wanted to go out, I was told that it was all booked up. I said that how can it be booked in advance as it’s supposed to be first come first served.After I mentioned that the chef Conceirge Freddy said that in that case he would arrange for the rolls Royce to take me.I am not a Car person, but I was looking forward to this experience. Low and behold, I get down and they gave me a Cadillac. Now don’t get me wrong, I am appreciative of a house Car, but when I am promised something, I expect it, and to get something different with no explanation (the rolls was there, but apparently it was reserved for a vip), is disappointing.4: The elevators were horrible, upon checkin there was a 15 minute wait for an elevator...All in all ur was a disappointing and underwhelming stay, and for $800+ a night do urself a favour and go to the Pierre or St. Regis",Toronto,2,2.0

The rooms: Most comfortable beds and fine Fili D'Oro linens. Unless you require the linen mills of Italy to produce customized finery for you...these should suffice... Bath is lovely. The drivers of the Mini Coopers are so accommodating and I found this service to be a huge plus. The workout accommodations are great and I only wish I had taken advantage of the spa. We found the restaurant Clement to be completely delightful. The food was very good and the staff engaging and not stuffy. I read anything lower than 5 stars and think ""who are these people""?

It never happened to me, in any other 5-star hotel in the world, to be told ""I am sorry sir, there are no tables available"" for breakfast: this is something that the Manager of this property shall take very seriously...4) As hotel sits on 5th Avenue, some rooms can be pretty noisy: mine was fortunately on a high floor, but colleagues who were on lower floors complained about noise levels.5) While the rooftop bar is really unique, the quantity of people around is just too much: on the day I left, there was a 10 minute queue at the lift to get to the rooftop, which is ridiculous, just to get upstairs and find that the bar looks as crowded as Times Square on New Year's eve...I am very sorry, but this hotel is housed in a building which dramatically needs redesign and a fresh refurbishment, and is definitely badly managed.If it weren't for its address and for belonging to one of the most prestigious luxury hotel chains in the world, this hotel would be gone long ago.Sorry, but this is the hard truth.","Milan, Italy",89,2.0

The hotel, without exception, is the finest hotel overall in New York. I say overall because the review here encompasses not just what you get in a room but the service by hotel staff members. For New York City, I was amazed by the sincerity and genuine, friendly staff members. I had 2 visitors traveling to NYC from Italy to see the city for the first time. I wanted to make sure their experience was an enjoyable one. I cannot say enough praises for this hotel. It has the luxury and charm of 5 star but unlike the other luxury hotels, it offers a friendly atmosphere that you don't find in comparable hotels such as The Plaza. This hotel has old historic charm and yet successfully juxtaposes its history with a modern flair throughout while still maintaining an elegant and traditional impression - not easy to do! The result is a hotel that will appeal to all world travelers and delivers what one would expect in an elegant yet unpretentious New York fine hotel.Upon arrival the experience was very positive from the moment we arrived by car - immediately staff was there to accommodate on luggage, taking us to meet concierge who greeted us and took us to the front desk while finding an assistant to deliver our luggage to the room. Parking is provided by the hotel making it very easy to come by car. About $65/day which for mid-town Manhattan is standard. You also have the option to park in any area garage you wish. As a wonderful perk, The Peninsula does offer complimentary car service from Cadillac SUVs by drivers to luxury BMW limousine service we were offered complimentary to Lincoln Center for a night show to their own driver driven MiniCooper vehicles that can be sheduled making it so convenient to get somewhere on time if need be without worrying about your own vehicle and parking services - all complimentary! Even before arrival the hotel was in contact to welcome and assist by email. The room was everything you expect in a 5 star hotel - the decor was very elegant, in the best taste - the neutral color schemes of whites, beiges, black marble, cream marble and gold finishes were as understated as a Chanel suit. Beautifully relaxing atmosphere with large windows - the room was an Executive Suite with fresh plants, a beautiful Welcome compote of fresh fruits, the most luxurious toiletries in bathroom from Oscar de la Renta. The room is equipped with high technology including a bathtub television, bedside room and lighting controls. The bathroom itself was in total luxury in black marbles and cream stones with bathrobes and large enough for more than one person to comfortably show, bath use the sink and separate room for toilet. Everything was well thought out -the interior designer did an amazing job - you instantly felt impressed. The views from this room of the skyline and city center were amazing. The hotel boasts restaurants and bars to have a meal, a snack or enjoy a cocktail or hot drink. The lobby as well as other areas of the hotel features fresh flowers but also live plants and greenery wherever you go - there is nothing fake and everything is done first class. The lobby area features a small shop and easy to use/find restrooms making it convenient while touring the town and stopping by quickly without having to go upstairs to your room. The doormen and conceirge service teams are extraordinary. While other hotels expect patrons to pay a stiff tip, the team here gave you the impression they truly wanted to assist and enjoy their role in offering the best hospitality. Everyone smiled, everyone greeted you, everyone was very friendly without being sugary. To our amazement, the front desk upon hearing it was our first visit to The Peninsula offered a quick tour of the hotel premises - amazing especially for New York City! We were shown around the lobby, taken up the elevator to peruse the luxury spa that also offers hair salon and beauty services, a 24 hour huge fitness center offering classes and training, a bar area upstairs with views of the skyline. And 2 other best kept secrets by the wealthy who surely know this hotel very well: a huge enclosed solarium swimming pool I believe on the 21 or 22nd floor with sweeping views of Fifth Avenue and a peek towards Central Park! Absolutely amazing and surreal. To be in your swimsuit diving into a beautiful large swimming pool surrounded by floor to ceiling glass windows looking out to the traffic along Fifth Avenue! With plenty of seating and lounge chairs if you just wish to relax and read a book to get away from it all. The fitness gym features a full lockeroom with complimentary fruit and water and robes and towels and even slippers for walking around - with staff to assist. And the other best kept secret is the high floor (20 or 21st floor) garden terrace with lounge chairs and open air views along a full expanse patio balcony area that sweeps around the 3 sides of the hotel on Fifth Avenue so you can relax and enjoy the sunshine among sparkling skyscrapers and views of Central Park as well as incomparable views of center city Manhattan. My guests stayed for several days and each day we experienced the same consistent outstanding service from staff and I know they were thrilled with the room itself - which I should note was very roomy and larger than any other NYC hotel room I have experienced. And with its central location just blocks away from every major midtown attraction a guest would fully enjoy their time in New York City staying here. I send compliments to the dedicated staff, the outstanding management direction and to the Peninsula Group for creating an example of high level hospitality.","New York, NY",42,5.0

I had been on a family trip for one night, with my Mother. I have stayed with numerous ""five star"" hotels in major cities worldwide, especially in Manhattan. It seems that star ratings are often liberally applied, however, The Peninsula has earned their rating! The room was very well appointed and everything was in perfect working order. My room was spotess, whisper quiet and had nice views. I enjoyed the electronic controls placed throughout the room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom couldn't have been much nicer if I had designed it myself. I also interacted with many of the staff, including at the management level. Everyone was professional, cordial and accommodating. The pool, spa and Salon De Ning were fantastic. Very well done, thank you!","Albany, New York",67,5.0

It was our last night in Manhattan and it was the 29th November which meant the tree lighting ceremony was happening at Rockefeller Centre, so we wanted to stay somewhere close but also wanted a bit of luxury...We hit the jackpot when it came to the Peninsular! From the moment I made our booking till the moment we checked out, the service we received from the hotel was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before, completely 5 Star and beyond.Caroline was amazing, she helped make sure everything was in place for us when we arrived. She had arranged a special surprise for my son who was turning 2 years old in 2 days time, so it was the start of our early celebrations. She made the whole stay incredibly smooth and stress free, even assisting us with arranging a driver to get us down towards lower Manhattan for some last minute sightseeing. Rebecca was equally amazing! She helped me arrange a date-night evening in our room since my husband and i couldn’t get out to a fancy dinner with a 2 year old. She helped me prior to arrived arrange a personalized 3 course menu which the chef prepared for us in-room. She even ensured a copy of the menu was printed in our room on arrival. The food was absolutely spectacular! The rooms themselves are beautiful and you can’t pass up a relaxing bubble bath whilst watching some TV! The amenities with the room like Oscar De La Renta toiletries is a nice touch. The personalized letter sitting on our coffee table when we checked into our room. The little personalized dessert for my son’s birthday... it’s all the little touches which make you feel absolutely special. Yes, I will admit - the pricing isn’t cheap. And admittedly, when I booked I got a very good deal at the time... but I can understand why you pay a premium... you’re not just paying for a room or location but the wholistic experience!I honestly didn’t want to leave! I am counting down the days until I’m in New York again and I will definitely be making a return stay at The Peninsula... (I’m starting my savings now)!

Bathrooms are particularly clean. The 4-Star rating is due to our following opinion. Other travelers may have no issues with these and may think these are non-issues:As a Chinese-owned hotel brand, it should be no surprise that coffee and espresso makers were NOT in the rooms. For $50, and if there were any available, you could request one be placed in your room. Not a huge issue as you could take the elevator to the 21st floor pool to make an espresso, hot tea or latte. No top sheets—we requested a top sheet on our bed and received it. However, the next evening it was removed and we were left to sleep with just the comforter. (On this subject—Housekeeping did a thorough job twice a day.) Soaps & toiletries—Oscar de la Renta brand. Strange right? Not great, super cheap despite the designer name and certainly not fitting for a luxury hotel. Think your local health club’s liquid shower soap. Bring your own! We were expecting Milton Brown, Kiehl’s or higher end for the room price of $640/nite. Personalization of hotel staff with guests—the personalization and facial recognition of hotel staff with their guests was indifferent. No greeting the guest by name, little remembrance of guests day after day, hotel staff didn’t look us in the eye when speaking. Obviously these aren’t necessary in a hotel stay but we have always appreciated the hospitality of luxury hotel staff. This is not part of the hospitality of the concierge and front desk at the Peninsula NY. That being said, all staff were very pleasant. Compared to the Ritz, The Carlyle...quite different. The fitness club had Peloton bikes and a fabulous staff! The Pool staff was good, too. The Salon de Ning is worth a visit at nite to see the skyline on the outdoor rooftop terrace. Concierge had excellent restaurant suggestions and made reservations for us. Doormen not attentive but pleasant.

I believe it is priced so much higher than nearby competitors (e.g., Quin) because it has the spa with indoor pool, sauna, and steam room. But if you are traveling with a busy business schedule, you won't have time to use those things anyway. The gym is well stocked with lots of treadmills, a stair machine, several spinning bikes, free weights/kettle bells, jump ropes, and Nautilus-type weight machines, yet lacks some basics like an aerobic step (for box jumps) and only had one fitness ball (those big ones). Bonus: they offer a variety of free group fitness classes including early morning weekday classes suitable for business travelers, and reasonably-priced personal training sessions and massages. The rooms lack in-room coffee makers but have well-stocked minibars. The room service fare is delicious and priced comparable to other luxury hotels (and bonus: offers some all-day breakfast selections, which I liked). Room had excellent lighting and a well-stocked and well-lit desk with a laser printer (!) and office supplies like a stapler and highlighter. If I'd been able to connect and print things, it would have been great, but who travels with the necessary cable to connect your laptop to a printer? I would rather have had an in-room bluetooth speaker, which the room lacked. Bathroom is equipped with a TV above the tub (but if you are traveling for business, I doubt you'll get any use from this). All customer service personnel were top notch. Hotel Wifi worked like a dream. Nice lamps right above bed for reading in bed.

Flying from CA - NY is daunting enough but to then be faced with rude and unhelpful service upon arrival is COM[LETELY unacceptable. We arrived Thursday evening at 9:15 and did not want to eat in the bar AGAIN as it is uncomfortable and lame for dining. The restaurant was already closed due to the fact it was ""off season"" so we asked to take the ""house car"" to a restaurant that the front desk recommended. The very weak concierge told us the house car had stopped running 15 minutes earlier. Yes, we could have taken Uber or a taxi but the issue is that the concierge could have stepped up and offered alternate suggestions or even apologized, The concierge can take a page out of Nordstrom's C/.S book to assist the customer paying over $800- per night.Our previous stay in November 2017 had so many negative issues that the front desk supervisor said on our next stay ( this stay) our room would be ""upgraded twice"" on an upper floor. We were on the 16th floor yet the room was not an upgrade from previous stays.Main issues revolve around the executive office (rude and uncaring), the front desk staff and the concierge.

Sadly, it seemed that the hotel hadn't adequately prepared its staff to deal with the holiday rush.There was a bit of a wait to valet our car. Once we were able to get out staff quickly helped us with our bags. Check in was fast, and we appreciated an upgraded room, though there was a line of other impatient guests forming around us during the process. The room itself was very spacious by NY standards, and would have been extremely luxurious in the late 1980s. The dated lighting control panels, anachronistic fax lines, and small, cathode-ray tube TV in the bathroom seemed out of place in a hotel charging an advertised $1300/night. Linens were excellent, the bed felt tired (and extremely springy). No iPod dock or speaker system, and only one bank of outlets worked in our room (none near the bed). The bathroom was large and comfortable, though our tap leaked water onto the granite counter.The best parts of our stay were the pool - which is lovely - and the housekeeping service, which was flawless, with turn-downs at night and wonderful small touches. The unexpected, less tangible experiences you might expect at a luxury property were harder to come by. We never were able to visit the rooftop bar, Salon de Ning, as it was closed for private events both nights. As it was 10 degrees outside, we decided to spend the afternoon of the 31st in the hotel. When we wanted coffee, we were directed to the Gotham lounge where we were told they were only accepting reservations. The hostess suggested the hotel's restaurant. After walking across the lobby, we discovered it too was closed for service and we were turned away. The reception desk helped us find seats at the bar back at the Gotham lounge, where we were charged $45 for two coffees and a half-dollar sized piece of cheesecake. Only later did we discover small snacks and a free espresso machine in the spa lounge (pro tip!), which would have suited us just fine. When we mentioned that the team should stop sending patrons to the hotel restaurant, as it too was closed, the staff started suggesting potential tea-takers to head across the street to the St. Regis. We began to wonder if we should have done the same when booking a hotel.We requested champagne flutes and a bucket of ice at a particular time, which arrived 1.5 hours early. Ordering room service was a fiasco. I was transferred twice, then told someone would call me back. When I called again ten minutes later, the front desk took my order. When I was told it would take 45 minutes to receive a cheese plate, the person apologized and told me the kitchen was extremely busy. The cheese plate was good! When we called to have the cart taken away, no one came. We finally rolled it out into the hallway. It stayed there until we checked out the following afternoon. The hotel's cars were only available to be used in a small radius around the hotel. As we were traveling farther downtown, we were quoted a rate of $188/hour with a minimum four hour booking for a driver. The hotel's Minis are a nice marketing idea, but not especially useful.There were armies of attendants, porters, and representatives in the lobby at all times. We felt welcomed, but only once were we helped with the door. I began to wonder what the purpose was of such a large staff, as we didn't see a commensurate level of service. Others have mentioned that the St. Regis, Plaza, or Waldorf have much more welcoming lobbies for lounging or meeting guests. If you're looking for a large, comfortable room in midtown with an upscale vibe and few lingerers beyond hotel guests, The Peninsula may be a good option for you. If you're looking for exceptional service or facilities to explore and enjoy, you may be better off looking elsewhere.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",7,3.0

I've been coming on and off for years, and it's always delivered in multiple ways. This stay was no different. Prior to arrival they arranged for upgraded rooms (Grand Luxe) and an early noon check-in. Immediately greeted curbside by name from a front desk worker, I knew I would be welcomed to Peninsula's brand of subdued luxury for the new few nights. The grand luxe rooms are generous in size - though not full suites - and quite well appointed with numerous small touches in the sleeping and bath areas. The windows are soundproof, TV and lighting centrally controlled, and beds fitted with top tier linens. I especially liked the silent heating/ac. Turndown and daily maid service was done very efficiently and constantly restocked all items. The lobby was extremely well secured and had a fun kids candy shop setup for Santa to give kids limitless goodies. A highlight was the pool, spa, gym on the 21-23rd floors. The pool has space , even in winter, to lounge and look across midtown. The gym had excellent brand new equipment with attendants standing ready to assist. And the Spa itself - I had a massage - was flat out the best I've ever experienced. Too nice to really describe - but the men's relaxation lounge, pre-session team room, treatment room itself, and locker room with sauna and steam were top of the line. I don't usually splurge, but this was my wife pushing me to go and I was happy she did. The Peninsula is not huge, it's not extremely welcoming to non-overnight guests (outside the rooftop bar with is very welcoming) since it doesn't have a huge public lobby like the Plaza, the St Regis, Waldorf or the Palace. And that's I guess an appealing feature for me. When you choose to stay in central midtown at a 5 star hotel, what do you really want? If it's a beautiful room, perfect service at your fingertips, a pampering spa, and quiet, then stay here.","White Plains, New York",62,5.0

It was our first trip to New York and we chose this hotel because of its good location on 5th Avenue in mid-town being close to Times Square and Central Park. We had a suite on the 14th floor with superb views down 5th Avenue with a king size bed and an enormous bathroom. Whilst there were a few minor issues on arrival these were quickly resolved by the front desk team with very special thanks to Dana who saved the day on more than one occasion. As you would expect from a hotel of this standard customer service was first rate and we were completely satisfied with the professional response to the matters raised. There were only two negative aspects from our point of view. Firstly the rooftop bar is ridiculously expensive for drinks and not particularly well organised. The view is good but certainly not worth the premium surcharge made on drinks. If you want an outstanding view spend your money on a ticket for the ‘Top of the Rock’ experience where the view from the 70th floor is breathtaking but you will have to forgo the drinks. Secondly the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room is a real disappointment as not everyone wants to pay for expensive room service if they simply want a cup of tea first thing in the morning!Other than this I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. ,"Maldon, United Kingdom",24,5.0

We had booked two corner suites, and on arrival neither room was ready. After a long flight from London with children, this was less than ideal, but the hotel found us a room to use until they were ready. My mother wasn’t feeling well and the hotel sent up tea and toast which was very kind. We had arranged with the hotel to add the package for the children of a gingerbread house and gingerbread decorating. Our room had some elements of the package missing and upon requesting these be delivered the following afternoon, they arrived 10 mins later. My parents suite was not a corner suite, and they were moved after one night to a corner suite. There were a number of miscommunications which became a little frustrating, regarding not receiving our bags for a good hour and not mentioning the reservation of $1800 for incidentals! This would not have been an issue had we been informed of it beforehand. However, each issue was met with great apology and rectifying of the situation to our satisfaction. The hotel and rooms are beautiful, the children’s complimentary sweet shop was a lovely touch, as was the in room candy cane hunt. The rooftop bar is very special and thoroughly enjoyed pre-dinner drinks here. It was a pleasure being welcomed back by the staff outside the hotel, and the front desk always greeted me by name and asked how we were. I think with some sharpening up of communication between departments of the hotel to provide a seamless service, this hotel could be absolutely first class. Special mention must go to Dana on the front desk who went above and beyond to resolve our issues, and is a credit to the hotel. The service that she personally gave us was incredibly understanding, helpful and kind. David who also delivered breakfast to our room was fantastic. Despite the hiccups, we hope to return to this lovely hotel.","Witham, United Kingdom",44,4.0

The rooftop terrace offered spectacular views and was also decorated for the holidays. The candy shop in the lobby offering treats for young and old was quite an unexpected pleasure and not expected in NYC even though the Ritz-Carlton Orlando & The Waldorf Astoria in Orlando, FL offer something very similar. On the weekend, guests are offered hot apple cider, delicious hot cocoa, and trays of sweets which are greatly appreciated after a long day of sightseeing. My only disappointment was that there wasn't a coffee maker in the room for coffee or hot water for tea when relaxing in the room. There was a mini bar and snacks for purchase. Great amenities, warm robes, and slippers were also provided. I would definitely book this hotel for our next mother/daughter holiday excursion the next time we are in NYC.

I'll preface this review by saying that we booked this hotel as a last minute deal on a whim and were very much looking forward to staying at this well known property. We've stayed at Ritz Carlton's, Four Seasons, Langham property's, and Park Hyatt's in Asia. We are not new to travel. We were expecting an experience similar to what you would receive at any of the above. Not even close.Check in was smooth and friendly. We proceeded to the bar where we were absolutely ignored despite making eye contact with a younger gentleman employee wearing a suit twice. There wasn't even someone greeting guests (two girls and one male employee just standing around chatting) and there were a few patrons standing looking confused. My husband finally asked a server if we could seat ourselves and he pointed in a general location and said, ""Sit there."" We then waited 10 minutes to have our order taken. I should add that the place was not incredibly busy. There is a panel on the wall where silverware is stowed that servers feel they must SLAM each time they close it. It's awful! Soft close doors or dampeners or simple customer service 101 would fix it. Nobody wants to have their conversation continuously interrupted by a slamming cabinet door. Food was fine at the bar. Pours were meager. Sliders and fries come in a set of three and the cheese platter was OK. Room is small but comfortable. We paid $500 a night on a deal so I am assuming that the room we were given on the 7th floor is reserved for such. No coffee pot. I've never been to a FS or RC that didn't have a Nespresso in the room. Bed was comfortable. We asked a man at the front door how long for a cab as we had dinner reservations in and he shortly stated 30 minutes. No offer to call us one, no question as to where we were headed and applicable suggestions on best ways to get there. Nothing. A rude ""30 minutes"" and then he literally turned his back. To me this is absolutely unacceptable.We are here in the city for another day but checking out of the Peninsula and into a different 5 star where the service has ALWAYS been exceptional. Maybe we hit an off night but I would never stay here again. I've had better service at Marriott properties for half the cost. Such a disappointment.","Grosse Pointe Farms, MI",9,3.0

Our stay at the Peninsula was a lovely way to get into the holiday spirit. The hotel lobby is festively decorated, musicians play holiday songs, and there is a little candy ""shoppe"" for the kids (and my husband). While the rooms are fine--decent size (for NYC), and appointed nicely, our room could have used a little refresher. Closet paint had dings and scratches, my nightstand's doors did not close properly, a few stains on the rug. That said, the bed was very comfortable, we had ample feather pillows, the bathroom is very nice, and the rooms were quiet. However, what makes the Peninsula special is the attention to service--the staff is kind, attentive, and seek to be a step ahead of their guests in anticipating their needs. From check-in to check-out, the service was top-notch. From the doormen, bellboys, concierge, cleaning staff, as well as lounge and Clement restaurant, and fitness center personnel, everyone was great. Location is perfect. Easy access to theater (hotel offers a shuttle, but we walked to our show easily), shopping, the park, restaurants, 30 Rock, etc. The workout room is terrific--an excellent selection of cardio and strength/conditioning equipment.

Hotel location is top, concierge was great as well, very good recommendations and helped with restaurant reservations.Room was a disappointment for a number of reasons: seemed very worn out - in need of a makeover. While many reviews suggest the courtyard rooms are quiet my experience was the opposite: our room was right next to some sort of a power or A/C unit outside which could be heard very well on the inside as windows are not soundproof. Complained to the front desk but nothing they could do except apologizing. Bathroom was very nice and spacious, towels, linen etc were perfectly groomed (as expected from Peninsula).Before checking in I wanted to extend my stay, called the hotel and the person claimed the hotel is full at our rate for the extra night. Quick check on the web showed it wasn’t so had to call again. Minor detail but slightly irritating nonetheless - particularly given what you would expect from this brand.Compared with other Peninsulas we stayed at (Tokyo and HK) this hotel frankly was a slight disappointment.

This is something I would never expect to find in any Peninsula room, given their usual standards (see photo below). Also, their normally top-notch customer service was below par at times. When I called to have my suit picked up for pressing, I had to call back 45 minutes later to make sure somebody was coming. Another annoyance happened when housekeeping knocked even though I had secured a late check out the day before. Besides those three inconveniences, my stay was pleasant. The bed was very comfortable, bathrooms were ideal, and the front desk staff was always very helpful with any questions or requests. Great service.

The Peninsula does not achieve the same levels of personalized service and customer recognition that the Four Seasons hotels always do, but (a) this is still very good and (b) this is New York, not Asia, so one has to adjust expectations to what may be achievable.I was very lucky to be upgraded to a junior executive suite and I can certainly say that anyone staying in such a suite will be very comfortable indeed. The view from the windows was to an inner courtyard and to the exterior of other rooms, but I was interested in the comfort of my own room(s), not the view outside that I would get anyway when I stepped out of the hotel.The bed was wonderfully comfortable. The pillows somewhat soft but I am sure firm pillows could have been provided if I had asked. The bathroom was truly excellent - separate shower with space and good water flow, a magnificently deep bathtub and enough side space to rest an iPad while reading(!) plus a TV above the bath faucets if you want to watch something, lots of space and plenty of towels. Lovely soft plush toweling robes.The sitting room was nicely appointed and I appreciated having a large desk at which to work. The lighting control systems are a bit idiosyncratic but manageable. I have seen reviews that complain about the prices but, really, this is New York and the top end of the scale, so what do you expect? If you want the convenience of what is provided in the hotel you have to accept the cost. If you don't like those costs, then everything you want - restaurants, coffee places, bars, convenience stores - is a very short walk away. For completeness I would mentioned two negatives. First, the traffic around the hotel is awful (Uber cars can take 5 minutes just to get across Fifth Avenue to the hotel), which is frustrating but not the hotel's fault. Fifth Avenue at 55th without traffic is not a real world option. Second - and this is something the hotel definitely could remedy - is that there needs to be a better way to charge devices (phones, iPads, etc) by the bedside in the rooms. The only power outlets were behind bedside tables, awkward to access and did not all work. Most travelers come with a range of peripheral devices these days. A hotel of this quality should have plenty of easily accessible power and USB charging outlets by the beds. Mr. Crook, you are attentive to TripAdvisor reviews, so please take this point to heart!","Boulder, Colorado",90,5.0

We were treated like royalty for the duration of our stay and nothing was too much for the staff. We were welcomed and upgraded by two levels (wedding anniversary) and the room was fantastic. A personal note from the Hotel Manager, chocolate covered strawberries and rose petals on the bed when we returned in the evening after our first day of exploring. The location of the hotel really is perfect for whether you want to explore uptown or downtown. Very close to subways. A five minute walk to Central Park in one direction and a ten minute walk to Times Square in the other. There is always someone on hand to offer help or advice. Our room overlooked Fifth Ave which is just an experience in itself. This was our first trip to New York and I believe that The Peninsula helped to make this the holiday of a lifetime for us. I would not hesitate to book this hotel again on returning to the City.We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but we did have room service breakfast on a couple of occasions which was really great. We also made use of the rooftop bar one evening and it was lovely. Our flight left very late on our final day and we were able to store our luggage at the hotel for the duration of the day and easily collect this in the evening. There was only one tiny point, in that the gentleman working on the gift shop (who ironically I believe was British) was brusque when I wanted to purchase something on our last day. This by no way takes away from our thoughts on the hotel, but it was so obvious due to everyone else working there being so happy to assist. This wouldn't stop us from returning to the hotel.Particular mention to Kayla on reception who welcomed us on our first day and showed us around the hotel, she is a real asset to your hotel.

We couldn’t have asked for better weather in October with temperatures reaching 23C (74F) most days.We arrived at the Peninsula at approx. 2.30pm on 19 Oct to be told our room was not available. We’d just got off of a long flight from England and were tired but having been reassured by the front desk staff that it would be rushed to completion, we were happy to have a drink at the Gotham Lounge adjacent to reception. Unfortunately, this left less than a desirable first impression as all of the (empty) tables were reserved and we were given no option other than to sit at the bar on stools with our bulky travel hand luggage. In the pursuant 60 minutes - despite 4 walk-ins which were seated without issue - at no point were we invited to sit down and yet paid extortionately for everyday drinks such as bottled lager.Finally, after complaint to the front desk, the room was changed to an available one from the 18th floor to the 12th - I’m pretty sure this was only because they had kept us waiting until 4:15pm before I became frustrated and realised that my first day’s plans in NYC were spoilt and irreparable.Upon eventually reaching the room, I found nothing but praiseworthy points to make. The room was spacious, clean, well-appointed and very modern despite the traditional, midtown building. The decor and technological facilities - all controlled by a central console - brought the old 1905 Gotham Hotel into the 21st Century. Similarly the bathroom facilities were second to none with a TV embedded in the tiles above the bath and control pad accessible from multiple points. Staying in a Deluxe King Room meant we had a separate walk-in shower with obfuscated glass door and bath big enough for two.The rooms remaining features included large wardrobe space with all the trimmings you’d usually expect from a 5* hotel including hairdryer (one which my wife approved of), iron & table (with dry cleaning/press order sheet), large safe, quantity of hangers (with plenty more delivered by housekeeping upon request), minibar and copious drawer and cupboard space. The climate and electrical items were all controlled by a central console which made for pain-free room convenience and housekeeping were very flexible with service timings etc.Now, despite a largely glowing review with the the hotel being accessible to midtown, having great overall facilities and staff and it being very well appointed, there were unfortunately some items which will preclude me from visiting again:The Gotham LoungeThis is not 5* and not staffed by individuals whom understand the level of service expected by those spending Peninsula prices. A parochial feel with limited seating and average service if that.Salon de Ning (the Rooftop Bar)Despite a fabulous setting and fantastic atmospheric vibe, the rooftop bar is let down by aggressive, ignorant bar staff whom are not only impatient but are simply rude. The outside seating staff are far amenable but when paying $26 for one drink, I would prefer not to have a sarcastic barman.Basic RequirementsNever in my experience of staying in 5* hotels around the World (Seattle, Chicago, Miami, Boston, New York, Paris, London, Maldives, Oman, Caribbean) and even lesser hotels, have I experienced one without basic tea and coffee making facilities in the room. When phoning down to the front desk to mention this, they informed me that they would send a “tea kettle” (“kettle” to the rest of us) to the room with the prerequisite features of enjoying a cup of tea. No sooner did it arrive than was it gone - upon the next turn-down/room-service, the kettle and tea and cups were gone. In a fruitless attempt to reestablish the tea-making facilities, we were informed that a $25 + sales tax charge would apply. I enquired about the previous night and stated my dissatisfaction with this policy - the hotel credited one of the two tea charges (one of which was made without signature or consent) - that was the best they were willing to do. To add insult to injury, on both occasions, the remaining tea (50%) milk and cups were removed and yet the same charged meaning that it was effectively $25 + tax per 8oz of brewed tea.The minibar, whilst a staple of the 5* hotel was prohibitively expensive - so much so that it rendered the minibar credit afforded to us by our VIP travel status irrelevant. $10 credit per day and not one thing except a $9 Snickers (yes just one bar) was less than $10.Finally, so as not to leave the review on a sour note (or an expensive second-grade tea one), the staff overall were exemplary. The concierge service was one of the best I’ve experienced and the front desk were very approachable regardless of the guidelines within which they had to work. The hotel car is not to relied upon (I mean the complimentary one) as each time we tried to use it - having been assured by the front desk and the concierge desk that it was not bookable and was first come, first serve only - was miraculously “booked” each time spanning several attempts around the clock over 6 days. Prior visits to the Mandarin Oriental have always provided access to such cars; not every time as one considers availability but nonetheless often.In summary, this is a 5* hotel for those whom have not experienced that extra yard that most 5* establishments are willing to go. At these prices, the cost of a tea bag or two would usually be overlooked in favour of the $150 two-person luncheons but unfortunately, at this hotel, every coin is counted.Worth a visit, make it short. Plenty better than this in NYC.","Billericay, United Kingdom",5,4.0

I have stayed at Peninsula properties in Chicago and NY before but I haven't stayed at the NYC Peninsula for sometime since is super pricey with room rates over 1,000$ a night. This time I got an acceptable deal through Hotwire and I wanted to try it again since I have not been there for sometime. Is of note that the Peninsula Hotels are always renowned for the impeccable service.....NOT this time. Upon arrival the bellman was from indifferent to rude. He didn't acknowledge me and he told me ""is this your luggage?"" definitely not in the most polite way...I was stunned... this would be the response maybe from a Motel 6 not from a world renowned luxury hotel. I went into the front desk where Marc was super nice and made me feel welcome although no upgrade available since the hotel was fully committed. I went into my room that was very well kept with good size bathroom but not a room that you would expect in 1,000$ per night plus hotel.... I have stayed at St. Regis and New York Plaza and the rooms are much more luxurious. Still location location location and Peninsula is located at the best corner in 5th Avenue. Next day in am I had breakfast at the Clement, the service was very good although the omelet was overcooked and dry.... that is unacceptable for a 50$ plus SPA breakfast (omelet, muffin, coffee, and juice). Later on the day I went with a friend at the rooftop bar. I have to say that they immediately accommodated us without wait in a busy night. The rooftop bar is a big plus of the hotel. The service was good on my first visit but again not a 5 star hotel more so a casual bar place...with 5 star prices....the guys are very personable but very casual like they never trained for a place like that. Next day in am I decided to have just a quick coffee and I thought to go and try the Gotham Lounge that normally serves tea but its a nice little cove on the lobby level....I enter and I see a waiter so I ask if its ok to have a quick coffee there....he very rudely responded Sir we are closed we can't serve anybody at this time ...he looked very irritated that I dared to ask him a question and looked very busy doing nothing....Saturday night the saga continues...We went again to the rooftop bar this time late around 1215am or so.....the waiter rushed comes on the table and ask us ""what do you guys want...its late"" we ordered two cocktails and he brought them rushed and looking at us rudely like we make him delay his going home time.....around 100 am i made the biggest mistake of my life to ask for a coffee ...4 different waiters came by telling us we have to ask the manager if we can serve coffee at such a late time because they are closing at 100am and finally they said ok will turn on the machine to make a coffee just for you because we had the coffee machine turned off like they were making me a big favor....Super disappointed by the service and ready to check out in am (front desk very helpful and polite and they granted me a late checkout) I decide to go with a friend at the Gotham's place to have a coffee....my friend have already walked in and they asked him if he wanted to drink tea or just a coffee....since was just a quick coffee they put him on the worst table of the bar...when i came in i told him lets move and sit by the window....the place was empty only one table was full.....a waitress along with another waiter come very rudely and tells us this table is only for tea not for just a coffee...... THANKS GOD I WAS LEAVING from this place. We moved to another bad table had a quick coffee that was terrible and they charged us 40$ for 2 espressos...probably most expensive espressos in the world...My friend complained about the bad espresso quality and they responded we never had a bad comment before.... got an UBER and the bell man without a single smile like was doing a big effort threw my luggage in the car without any delay waiting for a tip that never came..... I would say this being polite... This hotels service compared to a 4 Seasons is A FAR CRY..... I don't think I would ever like to stay there again except if I get a great deal $$ and there is no other place available.....is a service embarrassment for any luxury hotel and no way would justify 1,000$ plus day stays....",Salt Lake City,31,2.0

Having stopped over at the superb Peninsula, Bangkok some years ago en route from Australia, our expectations of the New York Peninsula were pretty high, though we did not really expect the level of service that seems only possible in the Far East. In fact, though, the service was generally excellent! But for a few minor deficiencies in the facilities, we would happily have given an Excellent rating.The hotel provides all the amenities one would expect from a top-class establishment in New York. The location on Fifth Avenue, in easy reach of Central Park, Times Square, St Patrick's Cathedral, The Rockefeller Center, the Empire State and Broadway, makes it a perfect base for the tourist visitor. We loved being able to walk out onto Fifth Avenue and be immediately caught up in the buzz and bustle of life in this great city. Unlike some other city hotels, The Peninsula also has some sitting-out/sunbathing space, in the form of a sun terrace at the top of the building, adjacent to the hotels spa and pool facilities. With temperatures in the early 30s, this was most welcome.Berfore travelling we had asked for a room at a high level looking out over W55th street. On arrival we were greeted by the very pleasant and courteous Nicholas Chow who told us that we had been upgraded to accommodate our request. Good! We were shown to our room on the 15th floor; spacious, well-appointed, large bathroom (love the TV over the bath) with a very comfortable bed, nice view up Fifth Avenue towards Central Park, all fine and dandy - except for a few small points. One of the curtain draw-rods had become detatched from the window curtain and was hanging loose (the Bangkok hotel has electric curtains). We also found that the door enclosing the room-safe failed to close properly, and one of the doors on the bedside cabinet was loose on its hinges. Small details, but they give a bad impression - lack of care and attention to detail. Definitely a no-no in an establishment of this class.As we had arrived early evening rather tired after a transatlantic flight, we decided to order a meal in our room. This took rather a long time to arrive, but to the hotel's credit, without prompting we received an apology by phone and the promise of a chocolate selection by way of recompense. Good! The food was enjoyable but not hot, a common problem, it seems, with room-service meals. There must be an answer!We ate in the dining room next morning and enjoyed excellent meals. However, the selection is a very far cry from what is on offer at the sister hotel in Bangkok, so we were slightly underwhelmed. Thereafter we ate out, partly because of the substantial costs of in-hotel dining and the rather stilted atmosphere in the dining room.We spent a couple of afternoons up on the sun terrace. Nice enough but no-one asked if we wanted anything to eat or drink, which seems like a missed business opportunity. The hotels's nightspot, also at the top of the building offers night-time views over the city, but we found it very dark and gloomy and lacking in any real wow factor.The only other critical point is that the hotel's security seems a little lacking. Although the rooms are secured by electronic keys, the elevators are not, so pretty much anyone could reach the bedroom floors. This is a matter of concern in this dangerous age.Having made these comments, I must emphasise that we enjoyed our stay at The Peninsula very much, were generally satisfied with the room, and found the staff very pleasant and helpful. We would certainly recommend it, but it was not quite good enough to make us feel that we must return on our next visit to the city.","Warrington, United Kingdom",66,4.0

We had a Junior suite on the 12th floor, the room was large for 4 ppl and very quiet. The bed was okay comfortable not the greatest but the pillows were wonderful. The sofa bed was horrid, the mattress was springy and needs to be changed. Housekeeping was on top of things-maybe a little too much, ringing the doorbell a few times a day but not sure if it's a bad thing. No coffee pot in the room but they will bring one if requested. The pool area is beautiful.If you want to go to the roof top, be ready and go right at opening - it's very small and fills up quickly. Our server on the roof top was extremely rude, when I tried to order he would look to my husband - not impressed with that at all. I think I can order for myself, thank you! We didn't eat at the main restaurant but we did have a drink/meal at the lounge and it was good. Some employees went above and beyond for us but others were curt and very rude.

I stayed for one night in August. This hotel is quite pricey, I paid nearly a thousand for one night in a standard king room. This was my relaxation splurge before meeting up with some friends in the Hamptons.I get that this is New York, and that hotels are generally much more expensive than other cities, but I have stayed in much nicer hotels in Manhattan for less than half the price of this one. The bell/door service and front desk staff were all very nice. The hotel itself is quite dated, and really not up to the standard of a hotel of this caliber. The room was large enoughand the bedding and amenities were nice. The bath tub was quite small and the shower was not great. I kind of just expected more for the price. The pool area was ok although there seemed to be quite a few local people who were using the spa in the pool area and they were quite rowdy. The bigggest disappointment for me was the service on the rooftop patio. I've debated not posting about this because I'm not here to get anyone in trouble and everyone has off days, but I sat up there for a couple hours after checking out and the male server who was working in that area pretty much ignored me the whole time, he walked past me a few times and I tried to get his attention but he was always busy. He then disappeared for a while, so I went looking so I could place a food order. I asked the woman who was cleaning this area and she was very nice and tried to find him for me with no luck. I eventually walked downstairs to the spa reception and asked if they knew where I could place an order for food, they called and said the server was back on the patio and that I can go up and order with him. I walked back up and still could not find him, the nice cleaning lady then said she would take my order and call it down to the restaurant. Right after I sat down again the server appeared at my table and seemed to not be happy about me ordering through someone else. When he brough my food up (which was a very over priced small basic ceasar salad with a 20% delivery charge added) He asked what my room number was and I said that I had already checked out, he then started acting like I somehow snuck up there and insisted that I had to pay right away before I could eat. I then tried to pay cash and he said he could not give me any change if I paid cash. I then gave him a credit card and he finally let me eat my meal that had now taken over an hour to recieve. After that he never stopped by to ask me how my meal was and kind of avoided me for the rest of the time I was up there. I honestly would have rated the hotel much higher if it wasn't for that last experience leaving a sour taste in my mouth. The hotel itself is quite average in all other aspects and I will say again that all other employees were fantastic, maybe that one guy was just having a rough day or he legitimately didn't think that a young person with lots of tattoos could be staying there?Probably wont be booking there again.","Toronto, Canada",30,2.0

They also have a rooftop terrace with an amazing bar and great views. Our suite was spacious and beautiful. The bed was super comfy, and a sleeper sofa in the living room was the best one any of us had ever experienced. Usually you wake up with a terrible back ache, but the mattress on this one was great. Although we didn't have time to take full advantage of the beautiful spa, one of us did join in a water aerobics class in the indoor pool that was great.

After numerous flight delays, we ended up arriving around 11pm to the hotel. Our cab dropped us off and when we got out with our luggage, the doorman just looked at us and that was it. Then up the stairs we went with our luggage. The way the hotel is designed with the check in upstairs, I would have expected at least an offer to help. Nothing - even though there were about 4 staff members milling about. Ok, fine, I thought I would overlook this. We checked into our room nice and efficiently and then immediately went downstairs to see if we could get a drink. The person at reception wasn't sure if we could get up to the rooftop bar so he checked and almost seemed like he was doing us a favour by getting us in. No biggie once again. The bar staff were extremely friendly and service was good up there. After getting back to our room, we ordered room service as we were hungry and the rooftop bar was not serving food when we arrived. Room service was relatively quick and the food was good. The room service staff were very nice.The spa was real nice in the hotel and the gym wasn't bad either. What i loved about the hotel and really the main reason we chose it was the flexible check in and check out policy. Kudos to them. I've stayed in four Peninsulas around the world - Bangkok, Tokyo, Manila and New York. I expected the New York location to be on par with Bangkok and Tokyo - which were absolutely marvellous. I give it three stars simply because for a luxury hotel, our experience was not up to par with other Peninsuals or the Four Seasons for example.","Toronto, Canada",18,3.0

Worst was that our room had a terrible musty odor of cigarette, as if it had been a smoking room prior to the property going smoke-free and they hadn't repainted the walls or changed the carpet in the transformation.

Booking through the hotel website got me an upgrade with a view of 5th Avenue, instead of the wall of the adjacent building. The included breakfast was good and the staff service was nice enough. However, the hotel lacked that x-factor which the Manila and Hong Kong Peninsula Hotels have the minute one walks through the door.

On the whole, there was nothing seriously wrong I could put my finger on, but it was just a little lacking in something, perhaps service. The staff were not at all rude, but they just weren't welcoming. I didn't feel like they wanted me to be there. We checked in, got our room keys and that was about it. We did get a few head nods or hellos when we walked by the front desk but it felt forced.Here's an example of what I'm trying to describe. Out of perhaps two dozen times I walked through the front doors of the hotel, the door was opened for me three times. This is with multiple people(staff) standing around be it outside or inside. One of those times I was following someone else through so otherwise I might not have been so lucky. I can open the door myself, but for a luxury hotel with staff to do such a basic task and it not be done is suspect.I also don't like asking for basics like ice or an iron. I know they do this for you, but having an iron in the room and an option to get my own ice at 2:00 in the morning would be nice.I will say that we had a slight billing issue and they couldn't have been nicer in explaining and fixing it.I've visited the Peninsula in Tokyo and loved it.

There is no question that both are absolutely 5-star category hotels.But for proximity to the places I like to visit on trips to NY, hands down the Peninsula is better situated among the previous two.I go to NYC to watch Broadway shows, to visit St Patrick’s Cathedral, to go shopping, to eat at fine-dining restaurants in midtown. The Peninsula is definitely better situated. So, really, the Pen takes my vote for location, location, location.There is one other thing which made me sit up and take notice and for which I will now consider booking my next trip at the Peninsula again.I booked my online reservation on June 1 for a superior room on June 22 for 3 nights. The following day, I immediately got a confirmation email directly from the Reservations Coordinator of the hotel. I thought: great follow-up.Two weeks later, browsing through the Pen’s website, I noticed that they released a new room rate package that was better than what I got and prepaid for. On top of the usual amenities, this package included breakfast, a bottle of red wine, late check-out, plus discounts at the Spa. I called the hotel and got routed to another Reservations Coordinator who worked with me to modify my reservation and get all the perks of the new package. Thank you, Soreily Santos! That never happens elsewhere. Once you have pre-paid, that’s it. Apparently, not at the Peninsula. And then, when I arrived and checked in early at 8:00am – guess what?

Why so long? First, I always went for ""sexier"" hotels - Ritz Carlton Central Park, The Plaza, St. Regis, Four Seasons, etc. Second, their room prices are really high, even for me (starting around $895 for a room with a view of the interior courtyard). I was delighted to find - and took advantage of - the hotel's ""Pay for 2 nights get the 3rd night free"" summer special, and I was able to book a Grand Luxe room on 55th with a great view up 5th Ave. I arrived on a Thursday around 12, fully expecting to check my luggage before heading off for my 1:30 lunch reservation a few blocks away. Surprise! My room was ready - so I was able to check in, go up and leave my luggage and even sit down for a few minutes before heading back out. The only very slight disappointment here was that the promotion says room upgrades would be given if available, and I know from checking that there were, in fact, rooms available. But, that's okay - the room was certainly big enough for one, I was able to check in several hours early, and was given a room on a high floor, which I prefer.My room was next to the elevator, so I heard the occasional dinging, but nothing that disturbed my sleep or visit, and I never heard any noise from the rooms on either side. As you walk in, the room itself had a small foyer with a built in banquette on one side - I used it for all my junk when I walked into the room. There was a closet with a small safe, and a bathroom that was about the same size as the bedroom. The bathroom was all marble with a separate WC, single sink, sunken tub and walk-in shower. The only complaint - unless you are 6 feet tall, don't even think about trying to adjust the shower head - it isn't going to happen! They also have a hand-held shower wand if you prefer. Amenities are Oscar de la Renta, and they are not ""chintzy"" with the refills as needed. In a hotel like this, I admit I was expecting a tv in the bathroom, but there wasn't one.The bedroom itself was quiet and understated - the chair with ottoman was surprisingly low to the ground, but comfortable enough for watching tv or reading. The room is ""smart,"" so there are controls for everything next to the bed -lights, tv, temp, privacy light, etc. Biggest complaint -no place to plug in a cell phone by the bed. The bed in my room was a king size - the mattress is a little firm for my taste, but was fine overall. There is no sheet - only a covered duvet, which I don't really like since I tend to sleep ""hot"" and end up kicking off the covers, but still like a sheet. This is, of course, incredibly personal to my own taste, however. The tv seems to be about 40""...maybe a little smaller - very nice picture, huge array of channels, etc. There is also a very nice working desk and the free internet is MUCH appreciated! Each room can accommodate up to 10 devices. Upon check in I was offered a choice of daily paper - it only came 2 of 3 days. Not sure what happened the first morning. And I was also offered some chocolate covered strawberries since I was celebrating my birthday, and it wasn't until I spoke with Heidi (the fantastic front desk manager) that I was able to finally get those on the third night. She also arranged for my dessert the night I dined in Clement, which was much appreciated.I cannot say enough positive things about the Concierge service - there were 3 men in particular who were all incredibly helpful. I believe one was named Frederick, but I don't remember the other 2. They helped me arrange for the free shuttle down to the theater district each night (which was me in my own limo 2 of the 3 nights) - what a fantastic amenity! They also assisted me with a package on a day it was raining - finding a perfect bag so the gift I was carrying didn't get wet.My review of Clement will be done in a separate post - and it, too, is outstanding.Sadly, I didn't take advantage of the spa, which I understand is outstanding.

I have been in search of the best five star hotel with service that matches up to its ranking and so far, I must say, it's the Peninsula NYC here in NY. What I loved:1) Five star service with no evidence of pretentiousness. I HATE staying at hotels where the staff treat people differently because they are in an ""upscale"" hotel. Thank you to the staff for being kind to everyone. That goes a LONG way.2) Convenient location: on corner of 55th and 5th Avenue. Super easy to walk up and down and shop without having to take transportation to other areas.3) ESPA spa. Yes, it's expensive but I love the ESPA brand as the service is generally impeccable. I didn't take advantage this time but at least I know the option is there for next time.4) Rooms: we received an upgrade to a deluxe King. The rooms were well equipped and beds were CRAZY COMFORTABLE! Bathrooms were huge and for NYC, that's hard to find. The ONLY negative I would suggest to the hotel is to equip each room with an expresso machine. We were told that it would be a$50 additional charge to have the machine with ten capsules in our room. Please note to the management that in all other luxury hotels, this should be a part of the service you pay for in a five star accommodation - NOT an additional charge. This should definitely be changed. Other than the expresso machine, we loved our stay. Shout out to Christian at the front desk who was kind and sweet when we got to the hotel after a long day of travel. Overall, exceptional and I will likely be back end of the year to stay here during the holidays!","Dallas, TX",38,5.0

The location is excellent - we ran around Central Park on our first morning and then walked to Bloomingdales and the MOMA afterwards. The room is a perfect size and clean and fresh despite retaining the New York Art Deco style vibe. The bed is large and comfortable. The bathroom amazing - huge bath, separate shower that has excellent water pressure.We had our room upgraded too which was great.Needless to say the hotel staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable. Nothing quite like the good service you get in New York (compared to the uk sadly)! We ate at the Clement Restaurant in the hotel and it was wonderful. We've eaten out a lot back home, and despite the portions being a little on the large side, the actual food was impeccable. My husband had the best pasta he'd ever eaten!

This review is long overdue. We thought it would be fun to stay a night in midtown NYC - we are native New Yorkers and live about 30 blocks from the hotel. The hotel is located in a wonderful location. The check-in process was smooth. Our room wasn't ready yet so we were invited to go upstairs to enjoy the gym and swimming pool. My daughter enjoyed the pool a lot. The sundeck was great as well. The gym was very nice. The room itself was a good size and clean. The issue we had with the room was that it had a very strong chemical/paint odor. This was due to renovation that was happening on the floor. At no point during the reservation process was there a notice that stated that the hotel was under renovation. For example, I will be traveling to the St. Regis in Rome and it clearly indicates on its website that the hotel is undergoing renovations. During check-in, I was NOT informed that my room would be located on a floor undergoing renovations. At a minimum, I should have been notified of this fact at check-in, and optimally during the reservation process! How did I know that there was renovation on our floor at the Peninsula? Because half the floor was blocked off and there was a giant fan-like object in front of the area, and most importantly, the entire floor smelled of chemical fumes. I believe the giant fan-like object was to remove the chemical/renovation fumes. My young daughter was with me so as you can imagine, it didn't sit well with me that my daughter would be inhaling such fumes during our stay. When I called the front desk to notify them of the strong fumes, they told me that they would take care of it (no apology). By taking care of it, they sent housekeeping to spray the room with industrial strength Febreeze. An underwhelming response, especially for a hotel of this caliber (and the amount I paid per night - over USD $800). Not great service.Checking out was extremely slow. There were not enough front desk staff to handle the number of guests checking in/out. As you can see from my other reviews, I have stayed at many other luxury hotel properties around the world, and I was completely underwhelmed by The Peninsula New York. I just expected more and left wanting more.... Will not return.","New York City, New York",23,2.0

The gentleman on reception basically made me feel totally untrustworthy and I was mortified at my card being declined. I had to call my husband in the UK when it was 3am his time and he had to send an email with his details to the hotel. The whole time nothing was done to make me feel welcome or less embarrassed by the situation.Of course all was fine with card the next day, it didn't start the impression off well...On the up side the concierges were amazingly helpful (especially Peter!) and the treatment I had in the Spa was wonderful. The rooftop bar was also amazing even in winter and the views and cocktails are great.I would probably try somewhere else the next time as when I pay for 5* I expect it very consistently throughout including when there are problems. My yard stick would be the Savoy in London where I have always been made to feel like a VIP guest (even if I'm clearly not, and of course it makes you want to spend money in the facilities and return).I would come back for drinks at the rooftop bar and also breakfast was very nice but would seek out another 5* when I return again in June.","London, United Kingdom",3,3.0

The Peninsula New York is stunningly beautiful, especially at the holidays. The public areas are lovely. The rooms are bigger than most NYC hotel rooms, with super comfortable beds and impeccable housekeeping. The duvet is like a cloud! Especially nice is the foyer and ambient lighting if needed. The spa is nice with an extensive menu of very pricey services and a skilled staff. It's not as gorgeous as the one in Hong Kong, but definitely feels like a retreat. The private room doesn't have a view of Kowloon Harbor, but what other spa does? My one critique of the spa experience is that, during pre-arranged treatments, we were offered ""enhancements""--extra treatments at an extra charge. When you're relaxing in your hot mud wrap, you don't really want to hear about extras. Please offer the add-on treatments at check-in, not in the middle of the experience. It's distracting. Standouts for us--They were very accommodating with early check-in and later check-out to fit our schedule. The bell staff took our luggage at the door and delivered it promptly, and on checkout day, we were able to leave it in the room and come back for it in the lobby later. There was an intern named Tony (I think) on the pool deck who brought us each a glass of champagne when he learned it was my husband's birthday. Also, a gorgeous complimentary small cake was delivered to the room. Thank you, Peninsula!Early morning complimentary coffee for takeaway is a nice touch. Wish they would extend the hours of this.Most of the must-haves are present--bedside reading lamp, robes, magnifying mirror, hair conditioner, full length dressing mirror, wi-fi at no extra charge. Very minor demerits for minor flaws. When you call the main number, there's a lot of switching around and hold time to get you to the right extension (and this was for a simple question). The concierge wasn't able to get us into Nobu (a nearby restaurant) but we were, which was odd. There's no tub in the bathroom, just a shower. The TV, radio and other media are extremely new and high-tech--and not in a good way. We're tech-savvy, but were not able to make most of the functions work for us, and who wants to spend their birthday weekend calling for tech support? It's simply not intuitive or user friendly. Bring your iPad and stream something instead.

We had an Executive Suite and a Grande Deluxe Room. There were six of us altogether--2 in the Grande Deluxe Room (my mom and my sister) and 4 in the Executive Suite (my husband and our two sons ages 17 and 15). A few days before our arrival, we asked for two rollaway beds so my boys wouldn't have to share the pullout sofa. The hotel said there would be a $600 charge for the four nights of our stay so we declined the rollaway beds. The hotel website said that those in suites could have a 3-hour tour of New York City in a Mini Cooper with a refrigerator for each day of their stay. When I emailed the hotel to reserve it, the hotel said it was already booked except for the Friday of our stay and reserved it for us from 2 pm to 5 pm. Upon checking in to the hotel, I re-confirmed this reservation. I was also asked to select which newspaper I wanted delivered to my room during my stay. I selected the Wall Street Journal. Well, during the course of the stay, I did not receive a single newspaper delivered to my room and when we showed up for our Mini Cooper tour, they seated us in a Cadillac sedan with a driver who had no idea he was supposed to give a tour and seemed to have never given one before. He was very nice and dutifully drove us around for an hour and a half but we had to supply most of the commentary ourselves. It seemed odd that the hotel staff was completely unaware of various offerings advertised on their website/or just failed to deliver them. Also, once we checked into our room, I saw in the hotel information book left in the room, that rollaway beds were provided at no charge for children under 18. Hmmm. Of course, at this point, the front desk staff said they were out of rollaway beds.All in all, it was a pleasant stay with a very friendly staff and nice accommodations.

Our room, an executive suite with the sitting rooms made up into a room for our three children nightly had fantastic views over the surrounding city. On arriving in our room we found champagne, treats for the children and fruit The rooms was very comfortable and was impeccably cleaned whilst we were there. All compliments to the excellent housekeeping team.The staff were all absolutely lovely. The waiting staff at Clement were great. The pool was brilliant - great for our children, and us after a hot day in the city. We also really liked the roof top bar - a lovely spot for a cocktail at the end of the day.I have nothing negative to say about the hotel. The lobby felt a little dark but it is a traditional hotel.

NYC isn't short on hotels and given this was a family vacation and we were travelling a long way we were hoping to cover as many bases as we could ie great location and a good nights sleep, quality food, facilities like gym and pool and staff that could both add to our NYC experience as well as be a part of it. We have three boys between 7 and 13 so we had interconnecting (fabulous) rooms. With a reasonable dose of jet lag we were all sleeping odd hours - which was really easy because the beds were super and the rooms were quiet. Lots of room for our bags and for kids to stretch out with ipads, laptops etc. Nothing seemed to be an issue for the staff at the Peninsula (servicing the rooms at odd hours and staying away when needed). Our boys were made welcome everywhere including at the surprisingly large in-door pool which is connected to the fantastic gym - amazing spot for a swim with views towards Central Park down 5th Ave. Breakfast at Clement was a great way to start the day and the concierge gave us fabulous tips for getting around town and booking the right style of restaurants for us - even with last minute changes. We could easily walk to most of the uptown 'destinations' (The Rock, Empire State, Museum Modern Art, Broadway, Central Park - and importantly for my boys the NBA store - and all the other brand stores for my wife). We also stayed with the family at another reputable 5 star hotel in Soho but would definitely stay at Peninsula again next time - it ticks all the boxes.","Sydney, Australia",0,5.0

I'd be happy to stay here again if the price was competitive but if I wanted all out luxury, others in NYC would come first. None of these issues significant but all small things that are better elsewhere.1. Being promised a welcome amenity on arrival which we then never received. Not sure why a member of staff offered it to us in the first place if it was not going to happen. 2. Rooms quite outdated. TV in our bathroom must have been a few decades old at least. Marks on walls and generally signs of wear and tear compared to rival hotels. Very old shower head where a rain shower would be expected. 3. One of the concierge team wouldn't try and change a time of our restaurant booking saying there was no point trying; incredibly dismissive and pretty rude. Luckily his colleague Elise was absolutely amazing and persistently tried until we did in fact get the time slot we wanted (an amazing meal at ABC Kitchen).

We’re very glad we did: we had a wonderful stay. The Peninsula is a beautiful property and a great choice in New York City. Our deluxe suite was stunning and so well appointed and comfortable that we didn’t want to leave: we could imagine spending a weekend in the city just hanging out, ordering room service and looking out the windows. The suite included a living room, with a fireplace and comfortable seating area along with a desk and dining table. Down the hall the other direction there was a small guest bathroom, a beautiful large bathroom and dressing area and a quiet, large and very comfortable bedroom. We slept very well in the king bed. Our overall impression of the suite was one of grace, elegance and comfort. It was really, really lovely. Service was somewhat inconsistent on our first visit, but much better this time with particular standouts including the staff in the Gotham Lounge, Clement (the restaurant) and housekeeping. We were lucky enough to get a seat in the very popular Salon de Ning on the rooftop and were impressed with the waiter’s attention to our dietary needs and follow-up on drinks and food (he did a better job of paying attention to a single gluten free request than many other waiters in similar properties). Unlike our experience in February, in the sunshine and warm temperatures of Memorial Day weekend, Salon de Ning was terrific on this visit (including the newly opened side terrace which is a great place to kick off a holiday weekend).We’re really glad we gave the Peninsula New York another try.

My stay was flawless. The staff was very on the ball. What makes this grand older hotel for me was the service. Anything I wanted, boom, it was there. I got in at 1am, needed some lozenges, they ran to the drug store as their little boutique was closed. I needed a humidifier, it was there so fast. When I forgot to turn off the ""privacy"" light all day and came in late, I asked for service and two housekeepers were there like they were paramedics. It was impressive to watch - one threw the pillow to the other, who would load it with a new pillowcase. They really raise the bar on housekeeping. Also, it is a very thoughtful staff. Unlike most other hotels, the bath soaps, hair products are by the tub, not only in the shower. Their room automation system must have been something before iPad systems, because there are industrial buttons by the tub, next to the master bed that work great and are truly charming. I could even be charmed by the old-fashioned CRT Sony TV facing the master bath because it was kind of in line with the button-automation system. The rooftop spa is jaw-dropping (see photo). The restaurant, ""Clement"" was fantastic. Their breakfast menu is really fantastic... you can choose a japanese breakfast, chinese breakfast (with dim sum).Where do I go on? Buttery soft linens, super plush towels, even a bathtub drain that doesn't growl!If you read my other reviews, I am very very picky about hotels. This one is honestly, and I'm not kidding - a cut above. From top to bottom you can tell that someone (probably the general manager) really inspires the staff to be amazingly attentive to all of the little details.This will be my place to stay in New York City, which I normally have dreaded because of the hotel choices (I know there are many, and believe me, I've tried).

NYC premium hotels scene is much more complicated than in Shanghai. There is no single leader. There are leaders in categories.  Being relatively active traveler, recently I stayed in four hotels in NYC: Mandarin Oriental, The Plaza, St. Regis and The Peninsula. All of them are great hotels with premium location, very high standards of service and in the same price range.  But, what sets Peninsula apart is people. People who work there and people who stay. Only in Peninsula I felt like honorable guest, because everyone there is. Peninsula is like oases in overcrowded NYC where you get very personal attention. If it's appeal to you, you should definitely stay there. Especially, I like to distinguish one person in particular - Victoria - the concierge. Not only she admirably cope with her professional duties, but also have impressive set of knowledge about culture and history coupled with deep understanding of customer needs. (Just imagine how different in fact could be questions that sound alike). I was really impressed and that actually made me write this to reveal my gratitude. ","Moscow, Russia",2,5.0

It is an older building and as much as they have tried to renovate it, it still has some issues that are due to it being an old building. Combine that with somewhat indifferent employees and you have a 4 star hotel. It is luxurious and comfortable. The public areas are all chopped up. You have to climb stairs everywhere - to get to the reception and elevators, to the bar, to the restaurant, to the fitness center. We upgraded to a junior executive suite because of a deal we got with American Express. It was a very nice room wth a very ugly view (caffeine lovers note there is no coffee maker in the room). My wife was a bit surprised that a suite did not have double sinks in the bathroom. Usually in a 5 star hotel someone always opens the front door for you. Here, like most service in the hotel, it is hit and miss. Service in the restaurant for breakfast was awful one day (food was excellent), great the next. We had a similar experience with room service and housekeeping. On the plus side, the fitness center is really good, spacious, very bright, with lots of cardio equipment, free weights and machines. The roof top bar is fun and particularly nice when the weather allows you to sit outdoors. We will not be coming back to this hotel.","Los Angeles, California",64,4.0

After giving it a few swings at the plate, I've come to conclude it just isn't for me.For the premium costs charged, the service just didn't make the cut for the second time in a row. There are many positives, the rooms are well designed, the control counsel next to the bed is actually easy to read and use. The room can be totally dark at night for good sleep. The people working there were all very nice. This is certainly not a bad hotel.I was only there one night, but ran into a few bumps. I had promised to take a group up to the roof top bar and when we went to the lobby we were told it had closed at 8:30pm despite it being advertised as open until midnight. This was the second time I've tried to take a group there after calling to see if it was open ,and upon arrival learned it had closed. In my room I got three calls over 60 minutes from confused hotel staff on questions that weren't relevant. On one they asked why I vacated the room, mind you I was sitting in my room. I was told all my belongings were gone from the room and I assured them I was actually looking at my luggage, some clothes on the floor and my briefcase. The calls kept coming on things that had nothing to do with me. After awhile I just feel like enough is enough. Every place has a bad moment, and I get that, but in the case of a brief stay and premium prices, these bumps just shouldn't be part of the experience. I was no fan of the lobby area also, small, dark, tucked away on the second floor and not open and spacious. Different strokes for different folks, but in the case of myself and The Peninsula, I think we're better off apart.","Los Angeles, California",160,3.0

I was given the use of an extension cord and power bar but have to remember to keep the night light on or there is no power.

Expensive, but wonderful. It is located at the top of the Peninsula New York, is conveniently located when one is in midtown, and has fabulous views of the city. It is not inexpensive. One glass of wine ranges from $19 - $22, but it is a generous pour, and is not ""house"" wine. Tables are served with a bowl of mixed snacks of nuts and mini-pretzels, service is smooth and professional, although they do rather rush you to leave when you decline a second glass of $22 wine to clear the table for a long line of those waiting. Because it is outside, smoking is permitted so if that is a problem, then it's a problem, but it's breezy enough that unless you are downwind of a table of smokers it isn't too bad. It's been around for a long time - I think the first time I was there was 20 years ago, and was one of the first rooftop bars in the city. There are a couple of outside locations available, and there is also seating inside if you aren't interested in a bit of a breeze and the view.

Its never late than better. Had been to this wonderful property in Nov'15. It was my client who booked this for me for my 5 nights 6 day stay. Had a long delayed flight from Mumbai and by the time I reached my hotel I was almost late by 3hrs. Was too tired and my client took me directly to this fab property which is almost a hour drive from the airport. Thank god there wasn't much traffic. I was helped in directly and the check in was smooth and quick. Thanks for the lovely welcome drink though. Every person was good starting from the door man to the elevator attendant and the wait staff too. My executive suite room was nicely done with all amenities and good usage of technology too. Simply loved my room and it comprised of a large comfy bed, a living room, a kitchenette and a warm nice butler service too. The room had a good view balcony and the best was the rest room that was huge n tastefully done. The mini bar was with plenty of options and they had spirits in my room which I got to taste it during my stay. Simply loved the champagne and the red wine though. The best was the master light control so that I needn't have to switch off all the lights every time I leave the room. The indoor pool was good and I had the best long swims everyday and the gym over there was gud but I was there only a day but couldn't attend for the rest of my stay due to my busy schedule but the guy over there was friendly n sweet too. My work place was just a 20 mins drive and the commute was nice too. A big big thanks to my client who made my stay truly magnificient n comfortable. Thank god I got to explore a bit of the city and loved the museums, nightlife and to the central park too which was quiet nearby.

We were happy to have the opportunity to visit on a recent long weekend in New York. We are big fans of Four Seasons and tend to compare all high-end hotel stays to those properties, but this was our third visit to a Peninsula property (the first two being Tokyo and Beverly Hills) so we had previous brand experience to compare this visit to. The Peninsula New York is a very nice property. The rooms have been (are?) being refreshed and the new look is well-done: in fact, it reminded us a bit of an older luxury hotel with its tasteful surroundings and quiet elegance. You can see the age of the hotel in the bathrooms: even though they’ve been freshened, traces of their 1980s past remain. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s worth noting. The bed was a bit of disappointment - at least compared to the always wonderful Four Seasons beds - it took a bit of getting used to and wasn’t as comfortable as it should have been (a bit too firm and not luxurious enough). To our surprise, service is where this hotel falls down. It was inconsistent at best. The staff in Clement, the main restaurant, were very good and made the two meals we had there even better. The housekeeping staff we encountered in the hallways were kind and professional and a bit nicer than some we’ve seen in other properties. Bar staff were good and bad: good enough in the Gotham Lounge where we had drinks with friends and bad in the Salon de Ning where we had late-night drinks on a cold night in NY with sullen staff that could hardly be bothered to be helpful. The front desk staff were nice enough, but we wish they had done a better job of describing the property and amenities. The bell staff were awful: we were greeted once on our many entries and exits and were only offered help with a cab once. On several occasions, there were no bell staff in evidence at all when we entered and left. Perhaps we’re have just been spoiled by other luxury properties in New York, but this was surprising. The spa at the Peninsula is a real high point.

Name/price/reputation lead to lofty expectations, and while I really dont have any specific complaints I just wasn't as overwhelmed as I expected and hoped. The room was lovely and comfortable, and certainly on the larger side for NYC, but not noticeably better than what you would find in any other high end hotel (Ritz/FS/etc). Service was very good, no shortage of people to wait on your every need. The rooftop bar is a really fun spot on a nice night, with great views and equally spectacular people watching. If you're an infrequent NYC visitor this location is probably ideal, near top shopping, famous restaurants, the park, etc. But for those looking for a slightly less touristy experience (most likely not the typical Peninsula guest) I would steer them further downtown to a more interesting neighborhood. Nothing to complain about and I wouldn't be upset about staying a couple nights again in the future, perhaps just not as great as the price and reputation might lead one to expect.","Denver, CO",52,4.0

No matter where in the world you are, you can always count on The Peninsula Hotels to provide you with an exquisite experience, with a wonderful location, never-say-no service, great food, fruitful local partnerships and above all, a sense of occasion everytime you step into the lobby. The Peninsula New York was no exception. The Peninsula New York accommodated our reservation request at extremely short notice during the peak season, applied Signature Travel Network amenities though I was booking directly (time difference disallowed my agent from doing so) and generally granted all requests. The hotel's location is excellent- tucked away on a corner of 5th Avenue, New York City is at your doorstep, yet the fact the main entrance was not on 5th Avenue proper made all the difference in terms of both discretion and being on a far less busy street. The cuisine was excellent, as were all members of staff that you came into contact with. The signature Peninsula bell boys are there to do all that they can to assist, including picking things up from around the city and delivering them no questions asked. This is not to say things did not go wrong- indeed, there was a misunderstanding in regards to an event that was taking place at the hotel, including miscommunication between flyers and staff in regards to the dress code and pricing, but it would be unfair to say this was representative of The Peninsula experience (which made the episode all the more shocking, but alas these things happen). The not insignificant amount was promptly refunded soon thereafter. Most of all, and more than the few things described above, The Peninsula, weather in New York or elsewhere never fails to deliver a canvas on which a guest can do as they please in a beautiful backdrop of tasteful elegance and attention to detail. In no way is The Peninsula cheap. There are many five star hotels in New York that charge a third of what they do, but perhaps their greatest achievement is that you walk out feeling you have received great value for money, even with the highest of expectation.","Manama, Bahrain",79,5.0

I was upgraded to a Deluxe Grand room which was spacious and very comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable, all the amenities in the room were excellent but no shower caps or cotton buds which are not essential but quite useful! I was also surprised that there was no turn down service but maybe that is something not offered in US hotels.The highlight of my stay there was going to the Spa and gym located on the 21st and 22nd floors. The gym is fantastic with state of the art equipment and is open to non-residents. I attended two classes - these are offered complimentary to hotel guests. The therapists are all extremely professional and top tip ask for Jeanine for a really great facial and Sasha for a truly excellent massage. I also used the hair salon and would recommend Bobby.The other tremendous highlight is their roof terrace on the 21st floor which is open in the evenings for cocktails and great music. Outdoor heaters at this time of the year are essential but they possibly want to consider naval or fur blankets like the bars in the Alps offer during the winter months.Clement Bar was excellent but the restaurant at breakfast was a bit hit and miss on a couple of occasions when they were busy.

The entrance is cramped and on a side-street, with loads of construction going on.

The main bar (left at the lobby up the stairs) is also great.

Our room was situated on the 7th floor, we didn't have a 5th Ave view, it was at the centre courtyard. Although we had no view to speak of, it was very quiet, with no NY noise.Only complaints I have was that there was no Tea Tray in the room, when I come back from sight seeing, I enjoy a cup of tea, ordering from room service will set you back a shocking 25 dollars!","Lancashire, United Kingdom",30,5.0

They were aware that we were there partly to celebrate our daughters birthday and brought a cake to the room on the evening that we arrived.We spent 7 nights here and would absolutely recommend this hotel.

Unfortunately, our time at the hotel can only be discribed as disappointing! This was our first trip to NYC and we had extensively researched luxury hotels in order to ensure we had the best possible New York experience. We selected the Peninsula after reading excellent reviews and are saddend to have to share our bad experience of our time spent at this hotel. I have never written a review of a hotel before, however I felt that strongly I am writing this at the airport travelling home! We arrived at the Peninsula at around 13:00 after an 8 hour flight. We were not aware of check in times and were told our room would be ready at about 15:00. The staff took our baggage and asked us to leave a contact number so that they could 'get in touch' when the room was ready. We were practically ushered back out of the main door! It is understandable that the room wasn't ready however what I find difficult to comprehend is how an establishment such as the Peninsula which considers itself to be a luxurious hotel, can justify the sheer lack of customer service by not offering two guests so much as a glass of water after a long haul flight. This poor first impression of the Peninsula continued for the duration of our stay. It was very clear (as is mentioned in multiple other reviews of this hotel) that those guests who book their stay through a third party are treated differently. In our experience this was most certainly the case. For example, we noted that several other guests (staying in larger rooms) were offered drinks and directed places to wait comfortably whilst the hotel prepared their rooms, and were given updates in regards to how long their rooms would take. We weren't even acknowledged and at 16:00 my fiancé asked for the third time if our room was ready to be told 'soon'. Our luggage then took a furthur 30 minutes to locate. This service would not be out of place at a holiday inn but a five star hotel? Appalling. We were made to feel like they were doing us a favour. The room was spacious and clean. We requested cups and waited an hour. When they did not arrive we requested them again and they arrived 30 minutes later. A furthur example of the hotels lack of customer care.During our stay my fiancé proposed and requested some champagne. This took over an hour to arrive. The reception staff didn't acknowledge the occasion furthur than a typed card.Finally, we spoke to the reception staff regarding the use of the swimming pool to be told it was not in use. This was incredibly frustrating and would have changed our minds immediately when selecting a hotel.In conclusion I'm sure that many guests have had a wonderful experience whilst staying at the Peninsula. However please be aware that if you book through a third party or don't fit the demographic of the hotel, you will be treated differently, regardless of how much you have paid. This did spoil out experience staying in New York and we would certainly not recommend the Peninsula New York to family and friends.","Scotland, United Kingdom",14,1.0

So familiar are we with the Pen, I didn't even post a review for our last stay in 2013. Las year, we egregiously skipped the Pen to try the much-buzzed-about-at-the-time NoMad hotel and its buzzed about restaurants. The restaurants were great, but the hotel was only meh--we found ourselves missing the Pen and its perfect midtown location. For this Pen stay, we used some vouchers purchases from my favourite flash sale website.I have booked the Pen's least expensive room, the Superior, on more than one occasion, including this one, but have never actually stayed in that type of room; we've always been graciously upgraded. I will say for this stay, our upgrade was of lower value than in the past--not complaining, just stating the facts. The receptionist said we were given a Deluxe room, but I thought it was a Superior because the bedroom area was definitely smaller that previous rooms. Then I noticed how large and open the bathroom was--it turns out we were in an accessible Deluxe, so the bathroom's shower was larger (so one can roll in, had a fold down bench) and the WC was not enclosed as usual. Most disappointing was the interior view into the U-shaped hotel's ""courtyard"". The room had a metal balcony and a sliding door that did not open fully, so the balcony was ornamental only. The sliding door seemed tinted, so that and the interior view itself made the room rather dark. Also, one can see into other rooms. The only advantage was the lack of street noise.There were no noticeable changes in the room's decor or amenities, except that the TV was even more current, with a huge selection of channels and movies with exquisite high definition.The overall hotel experience was lovely as usual. The doormen and bellmen, the front desk check-in, the concierges, the spa, fitness centre and pool staff all wonderful. Do take the time to enjoy the large fitness centre, the pool, the outstanding spa, and the beautiful and scenic Sun Terrace. The only niggles were: no acknowledgment as a return guest at check-in, turndown service that did not come within the time frame requested, and some confusion at check-out with the aformentioned vouchers, which seemed to end up in our favour. In the past, there has also been confusion at check-out with package inclusions.We did not experience the rooftop Salon de Ning or the redone Gotham Lounge this trip, but we did try the new-ish Clement restaurant for dinner. Situated in the former Fives space, it's pretty, with 3 dining rooms with individual decor. We dined early, so the staff told us they had a pre-theatre option where 3 regular-sized courses can be chosen off pretty much the entire a la carte menu for a fixed price--a great value. The meal was yummy, as were the cocktails, which are as pricey as at Salon de Ning. Service was friendly, but slightly unpolished (ie--staff talking loudly to each other from across the room). The tasting menu looked delicious also.Nearby, we revisited several dining spots--La Bonne Soupe, Five Guys, Benoit, the Halal Brothers carts. We also tried the new Polo Bar restaurant beneath the new Ralph Lauren store across 5th Ave. from the Pen. I remember when that space used to be the Disney Store. The media talks about a revitalzed Midtown--the Ralph Lauren store and the new Baccarat Hotel and Residences across from MOMA are often mentioned. The woefully missed Takashimaya Store space is thankfully no longer occupied by Forever 21, which has moved. Yes, 5th Ave. is clogged with tourists, especially in the summer, but it's a small price to pay for easy access to so much--shopping, MOMA, Central Park, Times Square and the theatres, Rockefeller Center etc. Another wonderful stay at a wonderful hotel. I know in the future I will contiinue to be curious about the newest, latest Manhattan hot spot. Even this year I actually booked, then cancelled, a Baccarat Hotel stay. It's comforting to know the Pen will always be there to welcome us back, regardless of past transgressions.",Los Angeles CA,1201,5.0

The service was top notch. The staff had an incredibly accommodating attitude, and made sure to take care of the little details. For example, one rainy afternoon as we were leaving the hotel, we were given a huge wind resistant umbrella. Everyone was very friendly. The spa and pool area is quite nice, and the rooms were extremely clean. We liked the smart light controls next to bed, which allow you to control the entire room from right from your bed. We wish that we had more time to sample the restaurants, and look forward to checking them out on our next visit. We were in town for a wedding and have lots of friends and family in NYC, so we were away from the hotel for our meals. We had a problem with a smoke smell in our room that was promptly taken care of by Samir, director of front office. He had an ionizer placed outside the room, and offered to upgrade us to a large suite. We declined the offer (we were about to go to the wedding and it was our last night at the hotel), but it was an extremely kind gesture. Samir personally met us at the hotel car, which he arranged to take us to the wedding.

I also went to the Salon de Ning bar on one occasion. And the concierge assisted me.The manicure was fantastic. It lasted a long time (i.e. the polish didn't chip for a long time) and was flawless. The spa staff were friendly and their ginger-based ""relaxation"" tea was delicious and refreshing. The Gotham Lounge was often a little crowded but in spite of that the staff were consistently excellent and very warm and friendly. Sure, the drinks are not inexpensive but the service makes up for it; seriously, I'd take the service here over the service at the HK Peninsula (yep, you heard that right: the NYC Peninsula does ""Peninsula Service"" better than the HK Peninsula). Two particular staff members were especially good (but I can't remember their names unfortunately! One was a female African-American actor (a lot of NYC bar staff are actors waiting for the next show opportunity, interestingly), and the other was a male Asian-American who's been tending the bar since the place was known as the Gotham Hotel). Salon de Ning was an excellent bar with great drinks and two incredible terraces with expansive views. One of the bartenders (an Irish man by the name of Ronan I believe? Sorry if I forgot) made sure that I got to see both of the terraces since one was still closed. I was very happy for that.The Concierge staff assisted me in locating a nearby bar as well; since I was not a room-guest I did not expect that at all. Yet they extended their services to me and I had a great evening at the bar they located for me. If I remember correctly, it was the actor-at-the-Gotham-Lounge who got the Concierge to assist me so my sincere thanks to her for that. The Concierge themselves were incredibly efficient and skilled!I honestly preferred the service culture here to that of The Peninsula Hong Kong (HK Pen is fantastic but also rather stuffy and makes-you-feel-like-a-colonialist-overlord which sort of makes you feel guilty). I didn't stay in the rooms however the location is reasonably close to Central Park (a few blocks walk), and right in the middle of the 5th Avenue shopping district. Also, out of all the ""major"" NYC luxury hotels (Pen, St. Regis, Plaza, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton) I think this is the least expensive of them all (room-rates wise)... given the quality of the service, I think it is fair to describe this one as the best value.Also, the building is very beautiful and historic. I can only give this place 4 stars since I didn't actually stay in the rooms (and I don't want to be unfair about things), but everything I did see was absolutely top-rate and the staff were phenomenal. The only real drawback is the price, but you do get quality for your purchase so it isn't a ""rip off.""",Australia,19,4.0

Also, the housekeeping staff can be very loud when in the hallways. They are trained to knock and say ""housekeeping!""

Lastly, there was definitely the smell of smoke in our room, two nights in a row. I called the second night and they offered to freshen the room and assured us that the hotel is non-smoking. If you are sensitive to smoke, consider a hotel that has fewer international travelers. It may be difficult for this hotel to enforce their non-smoking policy.

The next day, as a suitable room became available, we were upgraded to a Grand deluxe room on the 5th floor facing 5th Ave. The room, as you would expect from a 5* star hotel was well appointed, clean and very well maintained. Other visitors have commented on the street noise, particularly at lower floor levels, however we did not notice any such noise. Due to a limited budget we did not have many meals in the hotel but during breakfast on the first day the staff were informed of my gluten intolerance. This information was then, obviously, communicated to all the hotel's catering staff as I was told which meals I could have from the menu without having to ask myself. This is obviously a hotel that prides itself on attention to detail. All staff, bellstaff, reception staff, restaurant and bar staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. To be honest it was a great shame to leave after a week and I already planning for my return visit.Finally, it is surprising that this hotel has a lower than expected Tripadvisor ranking of all New York hotels.

From the minute you are greeted by the doorman you realise that you have stepped back in time and you are entering an establishment that has an awful lot of historyCheck in really smooth and prompt we were whisked up to our suite within 5 minutes of arriving.The room was as you’d expect for this type of hotel and oozed style and quality. The view wasn’t particularly great but the size of the room was very generous with good size living room dressing area bathroom and large bedroom with seating area. Having stayed at the Plaza previously and been given a shoebox to sleep in, I have always been conscious that the cost of space in New York is at a premium and room sizes can be pretty mean. Not in the Peninsula.Room service very prompt and courteous which is not always a given in 5 star hotels but we were impressed at the short league times for any request we had.Roof top bar Salon de Ning is a must if you are staying there with individual heaters perched above your head to keep warm from the NY winter weatherUnfortunately the pool was closed whilst there and a noisy family moved in to the adjacent room where it was acceptable for jumping on the bed and shouting without any parental interjection.One phone call and we were offered a quieter room and within 30 minutes we had been moved in entirety by the helpful asst. duty manager Chris and his staff.This made our experience much better and we could enjoy the peace and serenity of the Peninsula whilst looking on to 5th Avenue watching the rat race from 10 floors below.Without question we would return and thoroughly recommend to anyone who appreciates a Grand Dame hotel rather than the boutique flashy hotels that are available today. This hotel resembles the Dorchester, Principe di Savoia, George V etc. and we have come away looking forward to our next visit as soon as possiblePS to the parents of the room next door: We also have three children and understand they should be allowed to develop as individuals however teaching them manners and giving guidance when behaviour is unacceptable is an essential part of the parental role!!!!!!!!!","Leeds, United Kingdom",97,5.0

(Our reservationist was very friendly and helpful over the phone and we booked a King Grand Luxe Room.) We had a very warm and personalized welcome upon arrival and were escorted to our room.The room had that NYC-elegant feel to it. This room is the largest room under a suite and the bedroom area was a bit smaller than expected -- basically a decent standard-sized New York hotel room. The bathroom was huge and outfitted with shiny marble, a large tub, separate shower, a magnifier mirror, two robes, lots of fluffy towels, and an old TV behind glass above the tub. The separate area for the toilet lacked a wastebasket, which would have been handy. The entry hallway had a nice upholstered built-in bench which was a handy place to park our luggage. There was a desk complete with a printer as well. Other reviewers mentioned the ""control center"" on a nightstand -- it was handy for controlling lights, the privacy and make up room buttons, etc. It did look a bit dated, sort of in the way technology looks in an old Bond movies. In general room was very clean but surprisingly (for this level of hotel) there was an obvious stain on the ottoman of the chair at the foot of the bed. The next morning we also noticed a weird thing up at the top of one of the curtains -- it looked like maybe a small wad of tape or something -- it didn't bother us but we noticed it. The hot pink roses on the desk looked like they were just about to dry out -- I love fresh flowers but I would rather a hotel not have them if they don't look really fresh. With the exception of the restaurant Clement and the rooftop bar, all of the staff we encountered were really personable and attentive. My hubby loved the fitness center, particularly when a staff member offered him a cool minted towel while he was working out! He also lucked out and was able to use the beautiful pool (suggested by a fitness staff member) -- the next day it would be closed for renovation. Lunch at Clement was good but not great. The setting is inviting and lovely. Our salad was spectacular and they poured an enormous glass of champagne, but the rest of our meal was just OK. Surprisingly again, the service wasn't that attentive. We had to call someone over to refill water glasses, for example. At the recommendation of one of the lobby staff, we went up to the rooftop bar for a before-dinner drink. It was moderately busy indoors and we chose to go outside as we saw a bunch of heat lamps and it wasn't quite that cold out there with coats on. Even though we were acknowledged when we first stepped out onto the terrace, It took a really long time to get any server's attention. There was one unused heat lamp we asked for, but were told it was out of order. Eventually we ordered and got our drinks but by then could only drink half of them before having to go to our dinner reservation. It was a really a nice space and probably would be a great spot to hang out at some point. We didn't make it to The Gotham Lounge down near the lobby but surely wish we had as it looked like a super wonderful place to sit and sip and have a conversation. Perhaps we'll pop by even when we are not staying here.All in all we had a very comfortable little stay here and felt really good each time we walked into the lobby to go up to our room. The little issues were just that -- small (although unexpected from a hotel like this one).","Mahwah, New Jersey",400,4.0

The hotel has a great location on 5th Avenue, just a few blocks from central park. Note that the actual entrance to the hotel is on 55th Street and not 5th Avenue. I arrived quite late on a Wednesday night and was allocated a Grand Luxe room on the 7th floor (one category higher than I had booked).The room was quite spacious on the whole. The actual bedroom area didn’t feel very spacious, but the bathroom was very large and there was a separate area near the entrance to the room with closets and room for luggage. Some of the things I liked about the room – very comfortable bed, lots of mirrors, a view of 5th Avenue, TV in the bathroom, high-pressure shower, and nice toiletries (from Oscar de la Renta). It was a well-appointed and luxurious room, which is what you would expect from a Peninsula property.I did have a couple of complaints however – firstly, noise from the street was far too audible inside the room. Given the cold weather at the time, my window remained firmly shut throughout my stay, but I could still hear all kinds of sounds from the street below. Secondly, the electronics in the room were very outdated. The control panel next to the bed (alarm, radio, lighting, etc.) looked ancient. The TV in the bathroom was integrated into the wall, but you could see it was actually a box (CRT) model. Now, this wouldn’t have been that much of an issue if everything worked perfectly. But this was not the case – the radio didn’t work, the ‘Do Not Disturb’ indicator turned itself off a couple of times, and a few of the sockets didn’t work when trying to charge my phone. All minor niggles, but it did feel like a refurbishment of the electronics was due.The service I experienced at the hotel was exceptional. All staff were very friendly and courteous. I loved their attention to detail during turn down service – my iPhone charger cable was tied up with a ribbon, and they noticed a case for my glasses on the table and left a lens cleaning cloth underneath it!I knocked off a star from my rating due to the poor sound insulation and electronics, but on the whole this was an enjoyable stay, and in many aspects the hotel was excellent.

Having recently stayed at the Plaza, I was able to compare the two. NYC hotel rooms are quite small as real estate is expensive, but I found the rooms here to be decent, and this time was upgraded to a junior suite, which at 620 sq ft is pretty good for NYC. There is still some street noise so if you aren't used to city sounds, I suggest you ask for a higher floor. The location is great- walking distance to Central Park and all the shopping your heart desires on 5th Ave and Madison. Service was excellent on all fronts- from the bellman to front desk people to room service. AMENITIES: Great spa with an extensive array of services. There is a nice fitness center to use for people who need to stay fit while traveling, but I was disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations during my visit as it looks very nice from the pictures online- wish I had known that when I booked!FOOD/DRINK: I did not get a chance to enjoy the restaurant on site, but the room service menu is extensive and service is quick and to-the-point. I did, however, get to enjoy some rooftop drinks at Salon de Ning which were fabulous. Although the weather wasn't really suited for staying on the roof for more than 1 drink, I can imagine that when the weather is nice in NY it would be a great place to hang out and have a few more rounds.Overall a great hotel, I'm a little disappointed about the pool but would definitely return.","San Francisco, California",206,4.0

I always ask myself, why do I have to stay in such an expensive hotel and what do I get in return. In general, my expectations with these more expensive premium hotels include friendly helpful staff, great location, beautiful surrounding, large room, turn down service and fine bed with a good mattress and comfortable high quality bed sheets. I also love to have a helpful concierge and an onsite restaurant that produces edible food, in case I have to eat in the Hotel. In general these expectations were mostly met at the Peninsula, with some failings. Let us start with the room, even though I have a deluxe room, I felt that the room was too small. It was however, comfortably furnished. I just expected it to be larger particularly that I was upgraded from my original reservation. I just can not imagine how small my original room would have been. I had breakfast in the hotel every day as it was included in my rate. Every day I had to struggle with the waiter who would serve me orange juice which was probably purchased in a cartoon rather than the freshly squeezed orange juice I requested. The staff have a little of a sharp edge when you bring anything to their attention. The overall quality of the breakfast was just OK. I ate snacks and had drinks in their Gotham lounge. The service was better but the quality of the food was not up to expectations. I ordered duck spring rolls which were not fresh , my Ahi Tuna was fresh on the other hand but not well presented.The fitness area is nice but you have to fill in a form every time you walk in , I would have preferred to use my room card to access the area. And because it is next to the spa the receptionist has to ask you where you were going every time . Kind of annoying.Also unlike other large luxury hotels where you could find a seating area to read or just sit, only a small couch and a couple of chairs were awkwardly placed in a high traffic area. I would say that the location of the Hotel is great with close proximity to central park and to shops.So overall it is a good hotel, but I think there are better options at this price range.","Chicago, Illinois",51,3.0

Excellent Bell Boys too. The room was slightly on the small side, probably because of the amount of space the King bed and our four surviving suit cases occupied. The room was clean and the bathroom very nice apart from the bidet size bath. I'm a big guy who prefers a bath rather than a shower every now and then. Also, I felt that it was all ready for a spruce up.The concierge department were really helpful too and got their teeth stuck into the missing bag mystery as well as advising on anything New York.The biggest plus point about this hotel, apart from the wonderful staff, is that it's in the most fantastic location.

When we arrived, we were able to receive a noon check in (due to booking through Amex Platinum) and a late 4 pm check out the next day. The staff could not have been friendlier to our children. When we arrived they gave them snow globes and stuffed animals; they asked them to ""register"" and fill in their favorite colors, favorite things to do, etc. They made them feel enormously welcome. We liked the room as well. Spacious, with two queen beds. Very well appointed. The bellman came and gave us complimentary boxes of chocolate when we checked in. Comparing this to the Mandarin Oriental (which is also fantastic), I would say this place has an edge in terms of friendliness of the staff. The Mandarin probably has an edge in terms of lobby lounge and food in general. The ONLY thing I would criticize is that for a hotel of this caliber, the beds were just OK. The mattresses felt a little bit old (saggy in the middle). To make this place an A plus, I would say the management needs to take a look at the beds. They weren't horrible, but just not extraordinary. The other thing I would criticize is that upon immediately leaving the hotel, you make a left and are met with garbage, linen service delivery and pick up, and very shoddy sidewalks. I think they could make an effort to have some of those things hidden away a bit more. Then again, this is NYC and space is a premium.

I had very high hopes as I grew up in LA and the Penninsula there is considered the creme de la creme. Upon entering this hotel I immediately knew it was going to disappoint me. Service is weird and somewhat unfriendly - and a little too casual considering the prestige and luxury the hotel aims to convey....The lobby is understated and bland and rooms are just your typical generic hotel room, nothing special. Toiletries are the usual stuff and the amenities are also run of the mill.The service is so informal - it's strange. I called the concierge to ask them to book me into the afternoon tea in the lounge...after putting me on hold to check he comes back on and just says 'you're good' and then hangs up. This was my fourth attempt at booking this afternoon tea. I had emailed the dining manager per the dining brochure's instructions (no response), emailed the concierge - they told me to call the lounge myself (weird), and two attempts to get the lounge on the phone. I would later wish that I hadn't gotten my wish....I was really looking forward to it as it was a 'special holiday afternoon tea'. It was maybe the biggest disappointment of my trip. The sandwich portions were small and the pastries were way too sweet, unimaginative and somewhat stale tasting (specifically the macaron and scones). At $65 a head you'd expect to leave satiated and happy. We left feeling dizzy from too much sugar and hungry for some real food. They should ask if people want more sandwiches and also try to come up with more creative options for the pastries/scones.We asked the concierge to book us a table at a steak house with truly great steak. They booked us into a restaurant I've never heard of with very mixed reviews.Some good things:The hotel is very conveniently located, in walking distance to everything you'd want to do in NY.They gave us a free upgrade on arrival to the next room size upFree apple cider and gingerbread cookies in the lobbyNice big bathtubs and separate showers in the roomsComfortable bedsMore than anything this hotel is just unbelievably overpriced. If they want to be a $1000 a night hotel they need to step up their service, pay more attention to the details (better toiletries, fresher more imaginative food, tea/coffee makers in the room, etc) and work on the general guest experience. If I had paid $400 or $500 for my room I'd be much happier. Right now I'm feeling completely ripped off.","Greens Farms, Connecticut",126,2.0

Wonderful bedding, great bed, good layout.Bathroom - wonderful. I love great bathrooms, and this one was particularly nice. I always like when they have a tv in the bathroom because if I decide to take a bath I like to watch the business news in the morning.Service - spectacular. The concierges were very responsive and the housekeeping service was sublime. My friend and I both staying at the hotel would compete for what was the craziest or nicest thing at the hotel. She decided it was the scrungie that came with the shower cap. My personal favourite was that when I went out to dinner, housekeeping came in for turndown service. As part of turndown service they tied my Apple charges with Peninsula ribbon to make them neat and tidy!Value - this is a tough one. This is a very expensive hotel even by New York standards. I was able to stay there due to a corporate rate that made it only slightly more expensive than staying in a more ""standard business hotel"", but this hotel isn't really catering to people that have to worry about the rate.Given the opportunity, I would definitely stay there again.

The quiet, dignified welcome; the quick check-in was just what I expected. The facilities were, also as expected, very nice. I used the swimming pool and steam bath.But where the hotel really helped me was upon the arrival of my 90 year old father and my 85 year old mother. My Father was very sick (104 fever) when he got off the cruise ship. We wentback to the Peninsula and rechecked in. The staff provided wheelchairs and got my parents to their room.Unfortunately, my father's condition worsened and I had to call the Hotel Doctor. He recommended paramedics who then came to my father's room. The Hotel security person, Michael, stayed with us until the paramedics arrived. We eventually went to Lennox Hill Hospital where my Father stayed a week. My mother and I, in the early hours of the morning returned to the hotel and later were given by the restaurant staff a basket of baked goods. Ultimately, We returned to Alabama where my father is now in a rehab facility. Also, and most kindly, the manager of the Peninsula called me to inquire how we were doing.

Didn't partake in any of the mini bar items as the prices were astronomical, but as others have noted, most people that stay in this hotel probably don't even look at the prices.The price of the hotel is very expensive, but in Manhattan, it's probably a decent value compare to some of the smaller boutique hotels with incredibly small rooms and not great service.

So close to all the designer shops - dangerous if you're anything like me! I did visit downtown and have to say, although it's quieter and less hefctic, I'm glad I chose to stay uptown (the Piccadilly Circus of New York) as there's a lot more activity and easier to find something to do if you're not sure.The hotel is pricey, especially drinks etc, but it rerally is a very nice hotel and I'm happy to pay for that standard.

Not the case with the Peninsula in New York. It really feels like a step brother hotel - has the same name but different DNA. It is a nice hotel, staff is friendly, rooms are ok-nice but there are many hotels like that in New York with more than half time cheaper. The lobby keeps the old world run down luxury feel. Frontdesk area is a bit dark and is not very welcoming. The staff at frontdesk could be more welcoming. I arrived after 12 hours of flying and was not looking at my best and felt I was being profiled and questioned by a disinterested officer rather than by welcoming frontdesk staff. I was not asked for help with my luggage, neither I was offered to be accompanied to the elevator or to the room (as any well mannered 5 star luxury hotels would do). Rooms are small, appliances and furnitures in the room felt a bit outdated. Although bathroom is big and nice. In fact the bathroom was the nicest thing in the room and bigger than my living area. Above mentioned gets compensated by very nice gym/pool and relaxation area and the restaurant Clement. Excellent wine list, not overdone with dish choices, nice service and incredibly well food. But to use these facilities one does not have to stay in the hotel. Stayed once, probably will not stay again, unless prices come down more than half to make it worth staying.

The bed was huge and super comfortable. The alarm clock became very useful for my early mornings and it was lovely to be able to turn the lights off from the same device without getting out of bed. I never normally use hotel toiletries but with cabin-only luggage space was limited and the hotel’s toiletries turned out to be very good – shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, cotton buds, cotton pads were all used! Heavily perfumed but actually was very nice!They also provided 2 bottles of water and free newspaper every morning. On the second night I had food from the in-dining service. They wheel in a table covered with white cloth, silver cutlery and bread and butter. The food was good and portion sizes were big! I could access the gym facilities free of charge. They provide sweat towels and bottles of water on each machine. They offer classes during the day that are also free and use of the pool although I never got to try these. The gym facilities were good though and very handy for me to fit in a work out whilst being away! One of my colleagues had an issue with her hairdryer which was frustrating for her. Staff tried to fix it but by the time they realised it was a fault with the hairdryer and not the plug/socket/switch, it was too late and she needed to leave to head off to meetings. It would have been easier to just provide a new one. Although I couldn’t work out how to use mine either and it was a case of pressing the switch on the plug socket. So complicated for a hair dryer!! Free self-service tea and coffee was provided in the lounge early in the morning which was nice as the room I was in had no tea/coffee making facilities. Perhaps this is just for rooms that are booked for business guests as I’m sure regular rooms have tea/coffee making facilities? Would be nice to have tea available in my room. Staff were always very pleasant. One even ran out and down the street to help hail a taxi for us at 6am in the morning as we came out. The location is great, on Fifth Avenue.

The location is perfect for us, close to the park, most of the main shopping venues, and even walkable to the theater district if you enjoy a brisk walk on city streets as do we.The Peninsula has a sophisticated but low key vibe with an international clientele. It wasn't a surprise that we were seated at breakfast next to a famous Hollywood producer/director, but no one there would think of intruding on someone like that's privacy (I do however wish my hearing was better when I happened to overhear them talking about Sinatra). Since our last visit, the dining room has been very tastefully remodeled and renamed Clement, and the one dinner we had there truly was excellent - competitive I believe with the big name Manhattan restaurants. There is also a new small bar in the restaurant, where the head bartender is a master mixologist, and most personable to boot. Normally a plain dry martini man, the bourbon concoction he fixed me and the Tiki drink my wife were both superb, complex but not overdone and, for a change, fully worth NYC prices.The gym is very well equipped, with great views and a personable and knowledgeable staff. Indeed the entire staff at the Peninsula is what you expect but don't always get in a top hotel: well trained, friendly, there when you need them, but not intrusive.Give the Peninsula New York a try.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",13,5.0

For example, no coffee making or tea making facilities in the room. You can ask for a kettle, but tea will cost you US$25 + tax + service! Likewise, there is no shaving kit, no toothbrush or toothpaste. The service is nice so long as they are expecting a tip - if not, forget it! Especially I felt the concierge was more there to line his own pockets rather than be helpful towards guests. On the positive side, the location is the best in NYC.

I have to say the location is very convenient (3 min walk from the E line) with almost everything within walking distant. Our plan was to arrive early and leave our luggage at the hotel; instead, the front desk not only upgraded us but also found a room for our extremely early check-in (around 11:00 am). We were able to walk to the New York public library and buy our broadway tickets, then returned the hotel for a quick swim before the show. I used the female spa, the lady who helped me get acclimated was very nice. The gym was not too busy that day and I was the only one in the steam room. The individual shower room was great, water was hot enough with good pressure from both rain shower and hand-held shower heads. We went to their new restaurant Clement for breakfast. The service was impeccable-our waiters paid attention to every single detail. For example, I was shaking my teapot because I thought the tea pouch was not completely soaked causing a lighter tea taste. Within a minute, our waiter came to me and asked if I would like a stronger pot and replaced the whole set. There are also other examples demonstrating how this hotel pays attention to every possible detail-even the trivial ones. There are only a couple of things they can modify:1. No bath salt nor body scrub thingy in the bathroom. I am not sure if this is a "" upon request"" thing.2. I need to request for hot water because there is no water kettle in the room. I waited for about 20 minutes and no one came so I gave up.I will return for sure.

The hotel is in a very convenient location for shopping and Central Park. It is a bit longer to walk to the theaters. There is no real lobby area for relaxing, except a small bar on the second floor. Thus there is no real ""wow"" factor as you enter. The negative for us was in the area of service. When you are paying as much as you do here, it should be perfect. We had a package which included a bottle of champagne which was to be delievered on the evening of our arrival. It was not and we had to ask for it the second day.

Rooftop terrace is hard to beat when the wheather is good. Go for an outward facing room, the rooms which face the inner courtyard can feel a bit dark and does not give you the city view you want when in New York. If travelling with your family, I would consider: the neighborhood is hectic and shopping mainly consists of high end brands (Prada, Chanel etc), although there is an Abercrombie & Fitch for the teenagers, perhaps a SoHo/West Village location will feel more family-friendly. Location is close to Central Park so breaks on the lawn are possible, watching the yellow cabs on 5th from your hotel room is great fun for most children.

The first time to this property, I was not disappointed with the level of professionalism and hospitality that I am familiar with at other Peninsula properties in the Far East.The accommodations were pleasant and comfortable with every imaginable upgrade. Cleanliness was impeccable with nary a thing out of place. I rather missed the interaction with the pages at the front entrance. I only saw two the entire visit and never at the front door. Their smiles and wonderful habit of remembering your name by the second day is part of the charm and uniqueness that defines the Peninsula.The new main dining area Clement is a lovely spot with utmost in trendy decor. The menu however is thoroughly uninspired. Presuming the venue is named after Kwok King Man, CFO (aka Clement), you would think there would have been a higher level of culinary expression to celebrate this Peninsula icon. The other think I found a little surprising is the lack of hand made crafted cocktails, that is to say, the most elaborate cocktail that could be ordered with Bourbon was a Manhattan. The King Cole Bar across the street at the St. Regis was able to offer a slightly more current selection in the realm of hand crafted drinks. Judging by the clientele demographics upstairs in the rooftop bar Salon De Ning, a wider selection of slightly less traditional cocktails would be warmly received.All in all a lovely stay.

On our first day, as we sat there for a late lunch (our room was not ready for 1.5 hours), the waiter first got the order on the table to our left wrong and had to change it.. Then he came back to ask us again (15 minutes later) what our order was again -- he'd forgotten it. Then he got the order on the table to our right wrong. All of this taking place very slowly. The food itself was fine. Second, a room service dinner of chicken wonton soup turned out to be wontons full of shrimp (to which I'm allergic). I pulled out the shrimp and heaped them on a plate, then called room service to let them know they need to be careful about letting people know what's actually in the food, especially if it's shellfish. They were apologetic -- then called back 5 minutes later to say ""there was absolutely no shrimp in the wantons."" That was chutzpah. (Did I show them the plate, you ask? My husband had eaten them.) And then a series of small annoyances when you're spending so much money-- the tv remote in the room didn't work; when I was sick in bed with the ""do not disturb"" sign on the front desk called to say something was being left outside the door, but the staff person leaving it pounded on the door till I had to open it; other sorts of minor incompetence involving the front desk and staff; etc etc. Generally we came away feeling like the hotel was being run rather badly.

Chocolate covered strawberries and champagne were waiting for us in the spacious room and things only got better after that.

The highlight of our stay was on our wedding day, when we learned at the last minute that the city clerk’s office required us to have a witness simply to enter the office. I had previously arranged with Peter, the Peninsula concierge, to have the hotel’s mini-cooper take us to the city clerk’s office, so now, one hour before heading out I called again with my dilemma.

Upon arrival the door men scooped up my bags and led me into the lobby. The lobby is currently beautifully decorated for Christmas and enhances the luxurious feel of the hotel. After being directed to the check in desk, the process was quick and smooth and I was offered a free newspaper delivered to my room every morning. I stayed on the 15th floor in a superior room which was very luxurious. No view from the window but just what I needed to get away from the hustle and bustle of Fifth Avenue in full Christmas shopping swing! The room was wonderfully quiet and spacious. I had a king sized bed all for myself and a lovely bathroom complete with shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, sewing kit, shower cap and cotton buds. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and complimentary bottled water was provided daily. There was a mini bar and snacks in the drawers.The large desk came with a drawer containing a stapler (on a work trip this came in useful!), highlighter, paper clips and even a jogging map for routes in New York. There was also a printer but when I turned it on, it instantly started printing junk mail and wouldn't stop until I turned it off! I could get free wifi too which was great. I used their in-room dining service one night which was great, although I ordered too much food. The meal was very pleasantly presented (like I was at a restaurant) and came with bread and butter. The onion soup was delicious as was the risotto. I used their laundry service too with no complaints. I called them early on the morning to pick it up and by the time I returned to my hotel in the evening my shirt was hung up in the wardrobe. The housekeeping was great and the staff are super friendly. At one turn-down service, I was enjoying the in-dining service and the lady told me not to move and continue eating whilst she swiftly got slippers out for me, filled up the ice bucket & put a breakfast menu on my pillow.One evening the lever to switch between the bath and shower didn't work. So I reported it the next morning and they sent someone in straight away, it was all fixed by the time I came back in the evening! The location was great for me. It's a 15/20 minute walk from Times Square and on the way I could admire the shops on fifth avenue and at this time of year, see all of the Christmas lights. When I checked out, there were no issues and it was done within a few minutes.

We booked a Superior King Room. What we got was a tiny, cramped room that couldn't fit our luggage opened with room remaining to walk around the room without stepping over it--or into it. (See photos). The closet was a cupboard (see photo), and the room had a total of three drawers (not counting the one drawer they took up for the hair dryer), so unpacking was not an option. We asked for a different room and were told we were out of luck, all booked. I washed my hands and she took a short shower. The room obviously had not been inspected because both drains stopped up and did not drain. (See photos). When I tried to show this photo of the slow drain to a night manager, he looked at it briefly, turned his back and walked away. Of course, we could always gaze at our ""city view"". (See photo). Price for all this luxury: $1,199.14 per night, including tax, just under $6,000 for our five night booked stay. Meals and extras not included. We could at least save on room service, for there is no possible way a tray table could have been wheeled into the room. Folks, this is the most basic, no frills room you can imagine, which barely accommodated the short king bed, and cannot comfortably accommodate two guests and their luggage. Superior? Superior to what--a Motel 6? I think not. I have stayed in them and the rooms I've had were much more spacious. Do yourself a favor, find one of the many fine boutique and non-flagged hotels in this city, save some money and be far more comfortable than this popular-I-know-not-why ""luxury"" chain hotel.

The staff always superb, the hotels clean and the rooms ""crisp"". This NYC started out with a room upgrade and then went downhill from there. The suite was dark and not particularly clean. The turn down service came after I called and requested it after 9:00. When I turned down the sheets to get into the bed, the sheets were stained. It wasn't a new stain, but one that was embedded into the sheets, not a pretty or comforting sight. The HVAC control system has been upgraded, but it seems the mechanical aspect of it wasn't. It was hard to adjust and maintain a comfortable temperature in the room. To the point, it just didn't work. The final straw was when we woke up to a very foul odor at 5:27am coming from the ventilation system.

The only downside in our entire experience was really getting to the hotel for check-in because 5th Avenue was closed for the Columbus Day Parade and the taxi driver had to stop two blocks away. Lugging our bags in the midst of the crowd was NOT fun. However, that was quickly forgotten once we entered the doors of this hotel. Check-in was smooth, although the room was not ready until after we had returned from our matinee performance of the NYCB at Lincoln Centre. Service all round was top-notch and personal, from the reception who kindly extended our check-out time so that we would not have to endure too long a wait for our pick-up to the airport, to housekeeping who enquired not once but twice on the morning of check-out whether we required interim service, to the porters and bellhops assisting us during departure.Hotel location was perfect apart from the road closure, and the room was luxurious and very well appointed, without being over-the-top. I liked how simple it was to operate the shower head (not to be taken for granted!), and the plush comforting King-sized bed where you sank in and did not want to get out of. The one quibble I had was the hairdryer in the room, which had a fair amount of lint and hair dust on it and was rather in need of cleaning.

Many hotel I have used charge up to $10 for each package.The rooftop bar is excellent. Good cocktails, nice vibe, great bartenders and great views. It is a bit pricey though and both time we went there it was very busy (at 6 pm and 10 pm).The breakfast was excellent. They just opened the restaurant the day after we arrived and the three egg omelet was amazing.We had a 5 pm pickup with Dial 7 before heading to the airport and asked the day before if late check out was possible. The receptionist gave us a complementary late check out until 5 pm which was great. The day we left there was a parade going on on 5th avenue which closed the 55th street to our hotel.

The shining part of our stay at the Peninsula was the breakfast, which was very well prepared and served. As for room location. The first evening of our stay I was awakened at 4:30 by the guest next door who were coming in from partying all night. The walls seemed paper thin as I was trying to go back to sleep. I informed the clerk at the front desk about the situation she seemed unconcerned about the problem.  I normally stay at The Ritz Carlton hotels when in larger cities. I wanted to give The Peninsula a try but was sadly disappointed. The Peninsula, New York City, is not in the same class as The Ritz Carlton or St. Regis so do not expect the same stay when you decided to give The Peninsula your first try.","Louisville, Kentucky",5,2.0

What a disappointment! After having stayed at other Peninsula Hotels - Hong Kong, Beverly Hills, and Chicago, this place was a major disappointment. It does not hold a candle to the quality or luxury of the Peninsula brand that I have enjoyed elsewhere. I found the service staff to be adequate but surely nothing special in the world of luxury hotels. I am baffled at how some people can describe this as a great, luxurious experience. This place has no ambience. it is dark and dingy and has no lobby to speak of and very mediocre surroundings. During my recent visit, there was a black drape masking something ( i have no idea what they were hiding) in the area on the way to the elevators. It looked shabby and out of place in what is reputed to be a ""luxury"" hotel. The only thing about this hotel that compares with real top notch luxury hotels are the prices they charge! $9.00 for a diet coke! Another $9.00 for a bottle of water. $20 for 2 scrambled eggs. I have no problem paying those prices when I am enveloped in luxury. This hotel, however, DOES NOT MEET THAT STANDARD IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM! It is a very average/mediocre hotel. On a positive note, the location of this hotel is excellent in that is very conveniently located in midtown Manhattan and only a short walk to museums, restaurants, shops, and a comfortable walk to the theater district (if one enjoys walking). I would not return to this property again. I would much rather stay at the Four Seasons where I have stayed previously or the Mandarin Oriental for a REAL luxury experience!","Palm Beach, Florida",8,3.0

Tucked away on the corner of 55th St and 5th Avenue the hotel lacks the presence normally associated with the Peninsulas in Hong Kong or Tokyo. The entrance foyer is small and dark with stone and dark wood panelling. This is compounded by refurbishment of the restaurant which adds to the shortage of public space........but that's where the gripes end! The bedroom was spacious, comfortable, well appointed and bright. The service was absolutely of the standard you would expect - (rice milk sourced specially after a chance remark to a member of staff in the lounge) and combined with a great location adjacent to 5th Ave shops (and a shuttle to theatreland) we were very happy to have been recommended to this hotel.

We sat on the small balcony on the north side looking up Fifth Avenue towards the park, as it was shady. Great cocktail menu, ordered at bar but served at table. Second stop, the following evening five of us had ""dinner"" at the Salon de Ning, on the large open terrace facing down Manhattan. We had cocktails and then chose all the small plates on the menu and shared. The food was delicious and the wine, red and white and American by choice, was excellent. The service impeccable. On leaving discovered there was another large terrace looking towards Sixth Avenue, just as attractively set out.

This is a wonderful hotel. It always feels as if we are ""at home"" here.Staff is kind and helpful and discreet. Victoria at the Concierge desk is excellent. Rooms are large and very comfortable (except for the annoying lighting controls on the bedside tables); beds extremely comfy with lovely linens. Blackout curtains and double glazed windows make for a dark and quiet room at night. One of the reetaurant/bars is closed for renovation, so the remaining lobby bar is pretty busy these days. Breakfast room service is very prompt, courteous, the coffee is excellent, by the way. In the lobby bar, the music in not appropriate; however, no music would be better! On a recent short visit on our way home from Europe, I had a bad cold, and reached into my pocket for a kleenex, and a uniformed employee came rushing up with a wooden box of tissues; the very idea of a guest using crumpled up tissues was worrisome.

I go to NY often. With a lot of options in NYC, this place is expensive. However, it's a great hotel to stay if you are in town for business, a power conference or to take important meetings. Also if you can afford a more deluxe room, this place is good. The price may not be as worth it if you take a small room and it doesn't face a major street. If you are a looking for a place to travel with your family, or if you are looking for a ""hip"" place - this would not be my first suggestion. I'm in my 20s so I stayed here when I was in town for a conference. Most of the customers are international from Europe, the Middle East and some American businessmen. It is great if you are looking for a sophisticated business-like travel or you prefer the Peninsula elsewhere. There's another hotel in NY I stay at when I'm making more social calls to NYC where I can relax with a more younger vibe in an area closer to trendy restaurants and bars. Peninsula is located on 5th Avenue near the high end shops (although lately H&Ms and Forever 21s are taking over this ritzy shopping avenue), Central Park (the closest area to the hotel with good food options) and Rockefeller Center. There's also a fantastic view upstairs in the Terrace Bar. The bathrooms are nice and big (at least my room as it was an upgrade), beds are comfortable and you can print documents from hooking your computer to a port on the desk. It's great if you are in town for an important presentation and want all the 5 star amenities. The hotel isn't really handicap friendly though, since you have to take stairs to the lobby (there probably is an elevator but I think it's hidden) and then a second set of elevators from the lobby to the room... if that's important in making a decision. I'm a picky eater and there's fantastic restaurants around NYC, so I didn't really stay in the area often to eat - so I did take cabs, however the restaurant in the lobby is high quality if you plan to go to NY just for work and don't have time to venture out.","London, United Kingdom",2,5.0

Whilst this is undoubtedly a lovely hotel, with many excellent staff, I just can't give it 5 stars when I consider some minor flaws and a very high price tag. Some of the positives were:Excellent check in staff and bell staff on arrival - very helpful, welcoming and efficient. We got an upgrade to a room overlooking 5th Avenue.Rooftop bar was very nice and staff were great there too, although the weather was quite inclement at the time so didn't get to enjoy it as much as I would have liked.Room was very nice, as you'd expect for the Peninsula. Bathroom was really the highlight. The shower was without doubt the most powerful I have ever encountered - it was actually more like a water cannon when the showerhead was changed to ""soft"". But the stay wasn't without a few flaws, and even though I'm nitpicking, I feel I have earned the right to nitpick having spent over $2,200 on 3 nights here.Door staff were inconsistent. Other than arrival and departure, there was only one occasion in 3 days when the door was opened for us, even when we were carrying shopping.Noise from the next room - for almost the entire stay, I could easily hear my neighbour's TV.On the subject of TV - no HD! For $700 per night, I can't believe they don't have HD. The room had an HD television, but there is no HD content. The movie selection is very limited, and even the movie menu itself looks like it's from the 80's. A 5 star hotel must do better than this.I called for directions to the rooftop bar and was sent to the furthest corner of the hotel to catch the elevator. It was only on my way back from the rooftop bar that I noticed the elevator stopped in the lobby, so I have no idea why the front desk gave me directions that sent me right past it.All things considered, it is a very nice hotel, but at that price, those inconsistencies should be ironed out.

Rooms are roomy, especially by NYC standards. The bed and linens are very comfortable and luxurious. Location is great if you prefer to be close to upscale shopping, a few blocks from Saks, and within walking distance to the theatre. Getting a cab is difficult at 5th and 55th so leave extra time when you're going to dinner or a show. We saw Motown (fantastic!) but had to walk to the theatre because the bellman couldn't find a cab. Café Europa is just across 5th avenue if you want to grab breakfast (eggs, bagels, wraps, etc.) or a snack (muffins, cake, fruit salads, yogurt). Prices are really cheap and the food is fresh and good. We ordered a salmon BLT room service and it was delicious. Hotel bar is inviting and relaxing place to kill an hour before going to the airport or to rest after a long day shopping. A couple of negatives.....elevators are either up or down a set of stairs from street level; housekeeping is good, but could be better (only one bathrobe, bath salts and Qtips not replenished). Finding the wall safe proved to be difficult. It's behind the mirror next to the desk. Large bathroom, really clean and lots of counter space for make up, etc. We got a deal with Expedia. Unfortunately, our great deal also came with a view of a brick wall and the gigantic heating/cooling system. If it matters to you, make sure you're not facing the interior courtyard (a.k.a. the brick wall) when booking a room. We would definitely stay at The Peninsula again.",Toronto,217,4.0

This is going to be my first tripadvisor hotel review and I had decided to write a review for the hotel before checking in so, I was noting everything down and heres what I have to say:Check in: We were checked in by Diggy and it was a pleasant experience. He informed us about the closed restaurant (renovations - they are coming up with a new concept - makes me want to go again) and also walked us to our room. The attention made us feel like celebrities and Diggy answered our questions efficiently about the hotel and New York. Once we were at our room he showed us all the room features and also noted our news paper requests. I offered him a tip but he refused to accept it saying that he is doing his job, this was the first time I saw someone at a hotel refuse to accept a tip and quite frankly it left me thinking. Our luggage was already placed in our room before we arrived.Room: I must say the room was very nice. A few months prior, I was staying at The St. Regis and was told that the Peninsula is outdated but this clearly is not true. We had a interior facing room and it had everything we needed. The only negative I could pick out would be that it lacks natural light.Housekeeping - The housekeeping in the hotel is decent and every evening after a long days in new york city we came back to fresh, crisp sheets. Food: Since the restaurant was closed we tried room service the first night - the food was on time however it tasted bland much like airline food. We tried they're lounge food and it was much better but still not up to the standard I was expecting. Try eating out when you stay here. Luckas at the lounge was very professional and always had some good suggestions. Randy was a great host as well. We tried the rooftop bar and I must say it exceeded my expectations.Richard at the concierge desk is very efficient and was fast in recommending places/restaurants, he would instantly offer to make reservations for us and he has a good knowledge about the city.The hotel is very well located on 5 avenue in heart of Manhattan close to central park.The accommodation at this hotel is fantastic and the staff is always smiling and ready to help - Diggy would always enquire about how our stay is and if we needed anything. He knew that it was my wife's first trip to the city and was quick to send some magazines and maps to the room for her. The housekeeping staff on our floor would always greet us with a smile. I would say if you can afford it and are looking for luxury home away from home then look no further.","Denver, Colorado",4,4.0

I got the room on the 12th floor with views over fifth avenue. There is not much view given that it is 12 floors up, so perhaps street view is not that relevant at all, except that you do get some sunlight into the room in the afternoon, which can be nice in the winter months. There is free wifi in the room which is convenient for the business traveler.The bed is very comfortable, soft mattress and pillows, and down feather blankets, which is a recipe for good night’s sleep. The gym and the pool are located on the top floor. The gym is well equipped with instructor, but can be quite crowded in the morning. The pool is indoor heated but relatively small (around 12 metres long and maximum 3 lanes) and needs some touching up around the edges (there was some rust around the edges). It is quiet before 9a.m. so it is a nice way to start the morning with some laps in it, followed by a short rest on the pool chairs next to the window for some spring morning sunshine going through the daily newspapers and then breakfast by the pool side. The concierge team is quite helpful with all the restaurant bookings, recommendations, and can arrange late evening messages in room after the spa centre closes at 9:30p.m.Overall, it is a well-located hotel that provides a very comfortable stay, but needs to undergo some refurbishment soon to keep its edge on its competitors.","Hong Kong, China",40,4.0

We were deciding between this and the Ritz, and a friend suggested that the Peninsula was the less touristy hotel, so we decided to stay here. First, the location can't be beat--right on 5th Avenue, within running distance of Central Park and strolling distance of shopping heaven. The hotel itself is really nice--the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms amazing. I think of all the luxury hotels, the Peninsula has the best (and roomiest) bathrooms. I also thought they had the best gym--there's an indoor pool and the gym has all the latest cardio machines along with a generous area for weights. We didn't eat here--we had drinks in the hotel bar which were typically overpriced, but hey, that's what you get for NYC. Two drawbacks: oddly enough, the TV--neither the remote nor the regular button worked so literally we could not turn the TV off. I had to call several times to get them to remedy the problem, but they eventually did. I would definitely stay here again; second, the guy who helps you get the cabs--he was never able to hail us cabs.

When we checked in we noticed our junior suite didn’t have a door that separated the living area from the bedroom. To most guests, this isn’t an issue. However for us, one of us is a super early riser and does work in the AM while the other sleeps. When we booked the reservation we were assured by the reservationist that our room had a separate living space with a door. We stay in tons of hotels and every place we go we insist on the separation. On a typical night checking in we would have brought this issue to their attention immediately. The problem was we were late for a sporting event at MSG. Furthermore we stayed out pretty late following the game for a few adult beverages. When we returned to the hotel that evening we thought we’d mention the issue with the front desk just so they could make a note to the reservation department. We never expecting a room change given how late it was. To our utter surprise, Frederico (front desk) was able to move us into a room with a separate living area and cater to our needs…. At 3:30 AM! The Peninsula went above and beyond the call of duty and exceeded our expectations in terms of their customer service (then again, it was just as magnificent in Chicago so maybe we shouldn’t be surprised).

Room was certainly stunning looking, mini bar prices even made my eyes stretch and I'm a very seasoned luxury hotel dweller, and bar drinks were crazy. But, the money isn't really the issue. It's the fact that only the guys on the Gotham Bar could be bothered to smile and greet us. Not terribly important but noticeable and not what I have come to expect from a high grade NYC hotel.

I do not mind spending money on hotels because I like the comfort, service and accommodations they offer. However, if you are going to charge $900/night, then I certainly have expectations to match. In this case, the hotel failed.Booked a room online and requested double beds. Received a call from the hotel saying they did not have double beds available and if I wanted a rollaway I would need to upgrade my room. Thus, spent over $500 for the upgrade and $80/ night for the rollaway. When I arrived, I inquired about the cot and was told it would be delivered at turndown service. Cot never appeared.When I contacted the reception desk and told them I wanted to make sure I did not get charged for the cot as it did not arrive. They assured me I was not being charged. Upon checkout, I was shocked to learn the rollaway charges were on the invoice. The man at the desk said he would make the corrections as I went up to my room to get my bag. When I came back down, he handed me a new invoice and I left. When I was on the plane home, I took out my invoice and saw they only credited me for 1 night of the rollaway but charged for 2 nights despite never having received the rollaway AND checking with them during my stay.The hotel restaurant and rooftop bar were closed leaving the small Gotham Lounge as the only place to eat or drink at the hotel. Picking this hotel for the beautiful bar and arranging business meetings there left me frustrated at the lack of communication by the hotel to their guests. It would have been nice to receive an email or something from the hotel indicating the closures.The hotel was clean, bathroom was spacious, room service arrived promptly and the staff was very friendly...except bell man who was busy texting instead of hailing me a cab.When I returned home, I called and spoke to management about my dissatisfaction for charging me more for a room to accommodate a rollaway and then never receiving it compounded by the fact that they charged me for the rollaway anyway. The manager offered to credit my bill for the rollaway and upgraded room which I thought was the right thing to do.

Once the two phone lights are covered, the room could be made to be completely pitch black which was nice. No noise from the street but corridor movement could be heard. A couple of negatives were: 1) the fact that a late check-out was maximum 2pm (and they acted as if it was a huge effort) 2) we ordered a film but you are unable to pause it 3) the doormen were being paid kick-backs to allocate taxi drivers long fares or trips to the airport 4) roomservice cost was high (several additional charges) with portion sizes small even for European standards","London, United Kingdom",63,4.0

(Must point out there is a complimentary Nespresso machine at pool side which was VERY welcome at 5.30am when pool opened and kids had been up for an hour!)Apart from the pool I agree with LuvLuxTravel review..service was VERY slow at times, concierge waited for us to have carried the pram half way up the stairs before offering to help and staff on the roof terrace (Really beautiful setting and a must to visit!!) tried to tell us the outside area was closing (other people were out there) and they didn't want to put a patio heater on for a new table (at 8pm and the bar was open until late) until I suggested I go speak to management about that before they obliged (you don't expect that in a 5* hotel!!) also waited 45mins for breakfast in room as restaurant was closed for refurbishment (no mention of that anywhere when booking!!)The food is really good though and the beds super comfortable!

Was told to enjoy a drink and it would be ready - 45 min later I had to remind the front desk and then another 15 min wait. Meanwhile, the lounge/tea area was empty, service was slow and we had to find someone to pay for our drink - not the way I normally begin a stay at a Peninsula (or other luxury hotel). The room was nice, but not all I would expect. Carpet a bit stained and the walls around the dressing area are scuffed and banged up. The bench area and drawers for luggage (a fav part of a Pen room) was scuffed/dirty. We enjoyed a lovely breakfast in Fives one morning and the next the staff was inattentive and a bit rude.

What I found very odd however, was that there were no extra blankets in our room and just one pillow in the closet and no sheets on the pullout bed. We called Housekeeping and they were very pleasant of course and came to make up the pullout bed while we were gone. When we came back that night, we found that they made up the bed but didn't leave any pillows, so we wound up using the one extra pillow in the closet and pulled one of the pillows from the King bed in the bedroom (there were 4 on the bed). Because we had our toddler sleeping in the bed with my husband and I, we needed a 3rd pillow and another blanket. The next day I stopped at the front desk on our way out to ask for two extra blankets and an extra pillow (it's just much easier if the kiddos can have their own blankets when we're at a hotel & sharing beds since they move around so much when they sleep). When we got back to our room hours later, they hadn't been delivered. I called Housekeeping to repeat the request and they brought a feather duvet and a sheet instead. I wasn't in the room at the time so they delivered it to my husband who hadn't realized what I requested. After one more call, they finally came back with the blankets. Not a huge deal, but really, why would they not have extra pillows and blankets in the closet (which had plenty of space for it) like most hotels do??!My husband and I had dinner plans that night, and after we had left for dinner and our nanny and kids were in bed, Housekeeping knocked on the door at 9:20 for turndown service. My nanny had to jump out of bed to open the door to try to keep the kids from waking up. We didn't have the Do Not Disturb sign on, but nonetheless I would never have expected Housekeeping to come that late at night. And, for a hotel of this caliber and at this price, and who knew we were travelling with two young children (we gave their names and ages when we made the reservation), I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that Housekeeping be made aware of this and schedule our room earlier in the evening. Then, after Housekeeping came to clean the room on our second day, they took the half empty bottle of body wash out of the shower, but never replaced it with a new one. Which of course I didn't discover until I got in the shower the next day, which was the morning we were leaving. These things were not huge deals, but something I would absolutely not expect at a hotel that charges $1100/night for the room we stayed in. We found a deal on Jetsetter and paid half-price, but I would have felt very annoyed, to say the least, if had we paid the full price. Again, nothing major and if we were at a Hilton or Marriott, I wouldn't give it much thought, but for the prices they are charging, those small details are completely unacceptable. We often stay in Four Seasons or Ritz Carltons in other cities and never have any issues like that. During our last visit to NYC, we booked two rooms at The Palace on the Concierge level, for about the same price (and had no issues. In our experience, that was a much better value for the money.","Moorestown, New Jersey",4,2.0

We travel round the world staying in hotels for at least 6 months of the year and this has now become our favourite. The room (although without a view) was very quiet and beautifully furnished to a high standard. Immaculately clean. Breakfast in the hotel surpassed our expectations as did the drinks and snacks in the bar after shopping. Only one inconvenience....our limo had deserted us at the airport as our plane was 2 hours late so we had to get a taxi. There appears to be some kind of hierachy with the doormen over cabs allowed at the door because they refused to let us disembark outside the hotel, even though limos were doing so. This necessitated us being deposited with luggage on 5th Avenue and carrying it round ourselves to the hotel.Similar experience when we left for the airport. Our company had ordered a car to collect us but like 'Kazbird72' we were left over an hour waiting with no help from the doormen.

Upon check in we were immediately offered bottles of water and our daughter was presented with a small cuddly toy. We asked for a roll away bed for our daughter to sleep on but were told that due to ""health and safety"" this would not be possible. They then tried to get us to upgrade to a larger room at additional cost. We refused as we were pre warned that they would try to do this. Upon arrival to our room it was apparent that there was more than enough space for an additional bed.The spa on the top floor was amazing with fantastic views of 5th Avenue. We visited it every morning and the staff were very welcoming and one man went out of his way to make sure our daughter had a hot chocolate daily.I tried to arrange a session in the kitchen with the pastry chef for my daughter one day. Unfortunately no one called me back to arrange which resulted in a very upset child the next day. The food and beverage manager went out of his way to arrange a 30 minute session for my daughter that afternoon where she had a tour of the kitchen and then had the opportunity to decorate cupcakes and dip strawberries and cookies in chocolate. She had the most amazing time and I cannot thank him and the pastry chef enough.Upon departure from the hotel I asked the concierge to arrange a taxi for us at 4.30pm to JFK. It was nearly one hour later before we managed to get a taxi. We were told that an SUV could be arranged at the cost of $300. We saw that taxis were being turned away to force us to take this option. When the concierge left the front of the hotel we were offered a private transfer for $150 from a gentlemen outside who couldn't speak to us when hotel staff were there. Goes to show that even the staff were trying to make money out of us! To be honest we were so worried about missing our flight we nearly paid the $300 but luckily a yellow taxi saved the day.

The hotel is well located in the heart of Manhattan at the upper end of midtown. If you like shopping you can walk to all the big name stores, Henri Bendel, De Beers, Tiffany & Co, Bergdorf Goodman, FAO Schwarz, Saks & Co the list is endless and the shops at Christmas unforgettable. The Peninsula is by New York standards a boutique hotel, the rooms and suites are large, spacious and kept immaculately clean by the housekeepers. Bathrooms are large, very clean with mood lighting, radio, tv, telephone. Deep step in baths are a luxury after a walk around Manhattan, the shower is seperate, hot and powerful. Complimentary products are high quality and all the usual conveniences are available. On arrival in our room there was a complimentary platter with a wonderful cake and drinks. Rooms were made up at least twice a day with a turn down service at night. Breakfast was served in ""Fives"" restaurant with great views over Fifth Avenue and was ""A la Carte"". It was of a high quality, beautifully presented though prices did reflect this standard. Dinner was equal, nearing Michelin Star quality for the meal served at New Year.The Gotham Lounge is a downstairs lobby bar where you can take the famous Peninsula afternoon tea. I gave this a miss as it did not have the same atmosphere as the Hong Kong Peninsula and lacked some of the grandeur and theatre that comes with this type of occasion. The Dorchester and Claridges still do this better. The bar can get very busy with non hotel residents and this will certainly put you off from having a casual drink after an afternoon shopping or sightseeing. I didn't try try the bar at ""Fives"" as it appeared to be lacking atmosphere. The rooftop bar ""Salon de Ning"" on the other hand is a totally different experience. New Yorkers in the know come here after work for cocktails and this place had a really good vibe. It has an outside area where you can take in the sights and sounds of New York whilst looking up Fifth to Central Park or Downtown to the new World Trade Centre buildings. The barman here was outstanding.The rooftop Spa is exceptional as you would expect, the treatments according to my wife were fantastic. The whole Spa is extremely well maintained with superb attention to detail in every aspect of the experience. Please try the relaxation room and follow up with a massage.What makes this hotel stand out from it's competitors is the people who work here. There will always be a level of ""service"" at a hotel of this quality but I have never stayed anywhere where the staff all knew my wife and I by name and went the extra mile to ensure we had everything to make our stay comfortable. For the benefit of the hotel management I will mention those staff who should be praised for their friendliness and customer service - Sehiba (Spa), Lauren (Spa), Faisal (Concierge), Katrina, Cornelia, Amir, Nicholas (Fives Restaurant) and finally as truly outstanding Lukas Zehnder.

The property was noticeably busy relative to other times I stayed this year. The front desk was still accommodating at check-in, proactively finding us one room for earlier check-in and honoring a change to our requested bed type (switch from one king to two queens) for the second room. That second room included two children and there were two small plates of sweet treats in the room for them which was a nice touch. We did enjoy the location, the free wifi, the complimentary poolside Nespresso machine and gym. The kids also loved the TV in the tub. It also appears that an upgrade of the TVs may be underway since we noticed an instruction card in our room noting how to operate the new plasma screen TVs, though it doesn't appear ours had been swapped out yet.The one item that fell short of expectations was an apparent oversight with regard to the perks that we'd expected the kids would receive. I'd inquired in advance and provided their names and ages and understood they'd receive personalized folders/ business cards and Peninsula teddy bears. Perhaps it slipped through the cracks because of the busy holiday period. I had inquired with the front desk when I picked up the keys to the second room to ensure that was the one to which the bears would be delivered and was under the impression we were all set. I also asked the room attendant at turndown and she was going to contact the desk. That said, I think the kids had plenty of fun regardless and we were all quite pleased by the flexibility we were afforded with regard to early check in and the bedding type.This hotel is a good holiday destination for families if you can swing it, especially if the in-room technology is indeed in the process of being upgraded.","Dallas, Texas",68,4.0

We were given a large corner room on an upper floor where we had a lovely view of the city skyscrapers. The staff was very cordial and helpful. No sooner had we entered our room, there was a knock on the door and we were presented with a welcoming floral vase filled with lovely red roses. There was also a yummy fruit plate setup and a bottle of red wine waiting for us. The room was lavishly decorated and super plush and comfortable. Although not this time around, I was lucky enough to be the recipient of a gift spa treatment not too long ago and enjoyed it immensely. It was extremely relaxing. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough time to use the pool or visit the fitness center. Upon returning to our room after dinner and a nightcap at the Salon da Ning rooftop bar, we were presented with a bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries. What a night!!!

I asked to see other rooms but we were told they were full and would have nothing for at least several days (fair enough, this was a few days after Hurricane Sandy). I said that that the website suggested windows on two sides, and was told that a few did not have this feature - so we were unlucky on two counts: not enough windows and a low floor! This was met with a shrug. So we set about moving, and as soon as my cancellation was in place the next day, an alternative room was produced by magic. Too late - we were on our way to the Four Seasons (which I will also review separately). The room itself was perfectly acceptable, but over priced. It needed all the lights on, all day, even in the sunny weather.

Overall, The Peninsula is a wonderful choice for your next visit to New York City, even with your kids!:)","London, United Kingdom",12,5.0

As a group, Peninsula is one of the best. Their hotels in LA and Hong Kong are favorites. Sadly, we were less than satisfied this time as well. It could be that you are greeted by employees smoking on the side-walk next to the entrance, or that the lobby bar (which is closed till 11 AM) is far from being good as a lobby bar of a hotel with the ambitions of Peninsula should be (unlike LA) or the fact that the breakfast room is not very personal and a bit chaotic. We had four breakfasts and four out of four days we did not get the poached eggs made to our order. We were charged USD 9 for half a tomato with the eggs. Needless to say - not good enough. The location is good for shopping, but if you want an upscale 5 star hotel, you have better options.

The common areas are limited/small with no grand lobby. However, this also means no large groups or meetings, and more personalized service. This hotel could almost be characterized as “boutique” in nature. Though it depends on the city and the property, I have a marginal preference for Peninsula hotels vis-à-vis Four Seasons: Peninsula owns all of their hotels (with the exception of Beverly Hills, in which it owns only 20%), whilst Four Seasons is “just” a property manager. Also there are over 100 Four Seasons hotels and only about a dozen Pens. If I am not staying at a private club, my desired choice is the Pen NY. Now for the details.Location:Since I like to be between the theatre district and Central Park, the location at 55th and 5th is perfect. I am not a shopper but numerous haute couture shops are adjacent the property and I like to look at the Patek salon at Tiffany’s. Whilst 55th is a relatively quiet street, 5th Avenue is 20 feet away and is busy. There is a subway station at 53rd and 5th (E and M lines) and I will use the E line getting to JFK (you must transfer at Jamaica Station to the AirTrain) during traffic periods and when I have little luggage. That said, I doubt if many other – or any – Pen NY guests will take the subway to JFK. The most direct nearby luxury competition to the Pen is the St. Regis directly across 5th Avenue. It has a famous bar and an Alain Ducasse restaurant but the hotel feels too ostentatious for my tastes. The Lanesborough hotel in London – a St. Regis property – is much better. A further caveat to the hotel is that it does not have any panoramic views. If a view is your main criterion, look to the Plaza, Pierre, Essex House or (my recommendation) the Mandarin. That said, there is a nice view from the rooftop bar.Dining: There is only one restaurant in the hotel and it is called “Fives” (after the hotel’s location at 55th and 5th). In contrast to the Four Seasons (L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon) and the St. Regis (Alain Ducasse), the restaurant is managed by the hotel – not a celebrity chef. There is a new Spanish restaurant manager at Fives from the Carlyle so changes may be afoot, but nothing as of October 2012. The dining room is typically busiest at breakfast; lunch and dinner tend not to be busy. Much of the breakfast/lunch staff have remained unchanged since I started visiting the hotel ten years ago, and they are great (especially Nicholas). They remember my drink and food order, though I might eat breakfast at the hotel only six times a year. The kitchen is small and it must cook for the restaurant as well as room service. So if everybody arrives at once, you might have to wait during breakfast. Also, note that the service charge is automatically added to the bill for breakfast – but not lunch or dinner. There are two bars in the hotel – one is at the lobby level and the other is on the roof.Concierge:The service from the concierge is outstanding – even by Pen standards. I believe the entire concierge staff are members of Les Clefs d’Or. While I have been assisted by Tas, Faisal and others – all superb – my favorite is Victoria. In addition to a command of a number of languages, she has an arts background. So she was able to answer questions on specific pieces of art and artists. Last week when telling me what was playing at the Metropolitan Opera, she was able to provide a review of the production as well as a critical assessment of the opera in general. Her restaurant suggestions have been excellent also. I might suggest e-mailing the concierge desk prior to arrival to obtain suggestions regarding restaurants (as well as reservations), exhibitions and theatre recommendations. When I was once disappointed with the quality and timeliness of the concierge suggestions from a European luxury hotel, I provided a Pen NY’s e-mail to this hotel as a possible template for the future. Rooms:Large by New York standards – and very comfortable. Large bathrooms and nice amenities. Quiet. Avoid rooms whose windows face internally – it could be disheartening opening your curtains (and would say this could be the only serious drawback of the hotel).Spa:If you stay at the Pen NY, it would be a waste not to avail yourself to the gym/spa/pool. It is located on a couple of floors with an excellent view of 5th Avenue from the pool. I noticed people eating lunch around the pool, in addition to swimming and lounging. The gym is large and various fitness classes are offered during the day. I never have had any spa treatments. Unquestionably, this area of the hotel is special.And finally, here is my Judy Dench moment from years past. Unbeknownst to me, I dropped a glove in the hotel lobby. I hear a woman with an English accent say: “Sir, I believe this belongs to you.” It was Judy Dench and she had picked up my glove. If this were a MasterCard commercial, the tagline would have been “Priceless.” I have also seen a number of celebrities and international politicians at the Pen NY. Being from west LA, these sightings have no meaning for me; however, it does reflect the caliber of clientele choosing to stay at the NY Pen.","Santa Monica, California",18,5.0

We arrived at 3.30pm and were told our room was not ready as the previous guest was late checking out and the room would not be ready for at least another 40 minutes, if not longer. This threw all our plans into chaos as we were meeting friends at the Plaza for afternoon tea at 4.15 and wanted to change. The staff member checking us in was very apologetic but was a disappointing start.When we did get to our room it was on the 8th floor, which was also disappointing, but we were just thankful to get a room. The room itself was clean, large and well appointed with lovely comfy beds. Plenty of towels and nice amenities in the bathroom and a lovely big tub. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Double glazing helps to dampen the traffic noise from 5th Avenue but you still do hear some. Perhaps on a higher floor it is less. Large windows give good light in the rooms. Good sound proofing of rooms - we didn't hear our neighbours or any noise from the corridor.Position is great. Subway close by and great for shopping alomg 5th Avenue. 55th Street has a lot of restaurants in the block between 5th and 6th and we ate at a chinese one (can't remember the name) and the meal was good and inexpensive.Staff were good but I would not say exceptional. We were always greeted and the staff were helpful but nothing that stood out. We had the feeling as those on a short stay were not really that important. Maybe I am being unfair but I stay at the Peninsula in Hong Kong and the staff there are exceptional.All in all a good hotel well appointed but not exceptional and at the price would be among the most expensive in NYC.

The hotel is a wonderful combination of being a ""grande dame"" while also offering the style and convenience of modern discerning guests. The common areas were beautiful. The restaurant Fives was quite good as was the Gotham Lounge. Our room was a Grande Luxe Room on the 16th floor that looked out on 5th Avenue. The view out our window looked out on the St. Regis Hotel across the street which is easily one of the most beautiful buildings in the city. Our room was beautiful and comfortable and the spacious bathroom suited all our needs. There was even a tv near the deep soaking tub that the kids could watch while I bathed them. The hotel was immaculate and I never saw anything out of place. My niece came in from Brooklyn and was kind enough to watch the children while I enjoyed a 90 minute deep tissue massage at the Spa. The Spa was gorgeous and I felt relaxed from the moment I arrived at this urban oasis on the 21st floor. I was in the relaxation room before my treatment and a radiant, serene asian woman introduced herself and led me to the treatment room. She was amazing. She was strong, but gentle. Her voice was soothing and I was almost hypnotised by her. It was simply the best spa treatment I ever had. I thoroughly enjoyed the Peninsula Hotel. I would go back there without a second thought.

They are extremely polite and efficient and are not afraid to go out of their way to help accommodate your wishes. After a long flight with many delays I ended up not sleeping for 42+ hours before arriving at the Peninsula. The staff was very helpful in arranging an early and efficient check-in. After a couple of hours my room started to smell like smoke and we discovered there was smoke coming in from the hall between our room and the next room. I am still not sure whether an other guest or staff was smoking in the hallway, but fortunately the front desk arranged a new room within 20 minutes. Once again, they handled it professionally and efficient.Other positive points are the relaxing and luxurious Spa with sauna, steam room, great showers and massages. A unique feature is the swimming pool as not many hotels in New York offer one - let alone on the 22nd floor boasting great views over 5th Avenue and Manhattan. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed with the different restaurants and bars at the hotel. Maybe my expectations were too high as I have am a frequent visitor of the bars and restaurants of the Peninsula in Shanghai, which are absolutely superb! I had an average lunch at Fives - which lacks atmosphere. Staff was very friendly though and it is decent for breakfast. The Salon de Ning has great views over Manhattan, but the environment is empty and cold. Drinks are extremely expensive and besides the view, the bar was nothing special. I was extremely unimpressed by the Gotham lounge. Mainly due to the fact the waiters and bartender seemed to have missed out on the hospitality classes the rest of the staff did attend. Cold and uninterested, not even trying to pretend to be interested in serving the guests in the lounge. I would have given 5 stars, if I wouldn't have had this unpleasant experience in the lounge.

This was my 4th stay at the Pen, including last year's stay, which was inadvertently extended by Hurricane Irene, and during which the front desk was not up to task. Happily, this visit was redemption, and then some, for the hotel, as this stay was nearly flawless.The entire visit, in fact, was the friendliest I've ever encountered in NYC. Not only were all the people you expect/hope to be friendly (hotel staff, store staff, restaurant staff) friendly, but also unexpected folks like airport TSA staff, drivers, staff at tourist sites like the 9/11 Memorial, and especially the NYC woman running to catch the subway who thanked us when we stepped aside. It was as if the city's oxygen had been supplemented with nitrous oxide.Our stay began with the taxi driver asking to drop us off across the street from the hotel, us schlepping the luggage to the entrance whereupon the doorman scrambled to help and apologized profusely for the taxi driver's action. Up to the jewel-box reception area we went, scene of last year's misdemeanors. This time, we were greeted by Marie Anne, poised, professional and courteous to a fault, with a lilting French accent. We had booked the Manhattan Retreat package, of which she knew all the nuances--30% off spa treatments, a hotel credit, daily continental breakfast (or $90), late check-out. She escorted us to the elevator.The room was an L-shaped Junior Executive one bedroom Suite featuring a living room and bedroom separated by a dressing foyer with closet and luggage bench, and the large bathroom (about the same size as in Grande Luxe rooms). With the addition of a kitchen, the suite would have been a charming and large Manhattan pied-a-terre. The windows faced west and south with city views including the MOMA sculpture garden and Rockefeller Center/Top of the Rock. We could almost see the Hudson River. There was a large ""Welcome Back"" fruit plate on the coffee table. Since last year, the hotel has combined and modernized the TV and DVD remotes into one unit. Alas, I still couldn't get the photo memory card reader to work.Besides the breakfasts we had in-room, we did not try any of the hotel's restaurants or lounges this visit. I would like to try the Gotham Lounge afternoon tea someday. The restaurant Fives was not serving dinner for some reason. and we were a bit unimpressed with the rooftop Salon de Ning last year (go to the Sun Terrace for the best views).The Peninsula ESPA Spa remains the hotel's crowning achievement, rated the #1 US hotel spa by Conde Nast Traveler magazine in 2012. The facility has 3 levels--1) reception area, treatment rooms, men's and women's locker rooms and relaxation rooms, saunas, steam rooms, 2) Sun Terrace, a beautifully decorated wrap around space with chaises and dining tables, 3) pool and fitness center with yoga studio. I had been notified by email about the pool's closure for maintenance. Spurred on by the discount included with our package, I splurged on a Men's Retreat Package, which included a Deep Tissue Experience (foot bath, body brushing, massage), Men's Facial, and, unexpectedly, a bento box spa lunch, taken on the Sun Terrace with a view of 5th Ave. and Central Park. Such pampering helped lessen the small amount of guilt felt by whiling away half a day in a zen retreat instead of exploring all the city has to offer.Nearby restaurants we tried included The Modern Bar Room at MOMA (we had tried the Dining Room last year), and La Bonne Soupe, a casual restaurant serving French bistro food just west of the hotel on 55th, run by French expats. The more upscale Benoit, another French bistro a few doors down with the cache of being part of uberchef Alain Ducasse's culinary empire, was closed for remodeling. Also nearby and new since last year is the largest Uniqlo branch in the US; a Soho branch has been open a few years. Think of this clothing store as a Gap in its heyday, only larger and Japanese-owned.When checking out, we were graced again with the services of Marie Anne. Knowing from past stays how some details of package inclusions can be missed, I had requested a copy of the folio the night before, and Marie Anne took great care in making the necessary adjustments, a far superior experience compared to last year's exit. There was a small misstep upon leaving the hotel, when a sudden rain and late arriving car service left the doormen and valets scrambling about without offering an umbrella, despite the security man's request for one. Still, it will be hard to top this latest NYC visit, but I will continue to try, annually if not sooner.",Los Angeles CA,1201,5.0

However I did ask the front desk staff to mail a letter back to the UK which was never received. When I emailed the hotel a week or two after arriving home to enquire if perhaps it was still at the front desk or if there had been any issues, I did not receive a reply which was a little disappointing.We found the breakfasts a little chaotic, perhaps the kitchen or waiters were short staffed and one morning our breakfasts arrived luke warm. However they were happy to redo them when we asked.Our room was wonderfully comfy and there was no noise at all from the road which I was a little concerned about. I would only ask that the doors to the little balcony opened fully however I understand the reasons for this.The spa was divine as were the gym and pool facilities; I've never stayed in such a hotel where the gym was as good as this.Everything about the hotel exudes elegance and beauty, we loved our stay there and wouldn't hesitate to return when we next visit New York.The only negative? The rooftop bar, Salon de Ning, we felt the service was not in keeping with the hotel service. The serving staff are undeniably rushed in such a busy and well used bar however the service slipped and at times we were left waiting a very long time for our drinks or even trying to grab the attention of staff to order.I would definitely recommend staying at the Peninsula when in New York.","Hong Kong, China",39,5.0

Upon check-in we got a double upgrade to a beautiful room that was extremely clean and cool after a long bus trip (Limo Line) from Boston.The hotel staff was excellent and the room rate (Jetsetter) is well worth the luxury price. The check-in staff and bell hops could not have been any more helpful. Had drinks (expensive) on the roof deck one night and sat on the lounge chairs one afternoon.

Our package was called Manhattan Retreat (booked through Expedia) - which was a standard king room overlooking the courtyard, free continental breakfast and a $50 credit. When we checked in we were told that it was credits that they gave towards breakfast so we were not limited to the continental breakast and could choose whatever we wanted. It was $90 per breakfast, for two people. We managed to spend every dime - very expensive breakfasts! we spent our credit in the roof top bar. I had mentioned in my reservation that it was our 28th wedding anniversay and they provided a wonderful bottle of champage plus chocolate-covered chocolates. The hotel is spotless, the beds are very comfortable and the room a very good size. Very good location. The service was impecable and the concierge was excellent! We did not get to try the pool, however we did spend some down time on their lounging chairs on the roof top patio, very beautiful views. We did not use the Spa as it was very expensive and we just did not have the time. Subway was close by and we could walk to many locations like Central Park, Times Square etc...Even though we just loved our stay, we only stayed there because of the special deal as it is a 5 star hotel and very expensive.","Quebec, Canada",23,4.0

It's incredibly well located, the staff couldn't be nicer and more helpful and we were upgraded to a wonderful room. Unfortunately, the air conditioning in our room was not working properly - it was quite warm. Not bad enough to move to another room which the hotel offered, but definitely not comfortable. Each day we asked them to fix it and they said they would. We went three days like this and finally, on Day 3 it was fixed. If it could be fixed on Day 3, it could have been fixed on Day 1.Also, we stayed at this hotel specifically so my wife could swim. They have a modest sized pool that met her needs. Unfortunately it closed of maintenance half way through our stay. So, just unfortunate timing for us.On the other hand, the staff was incredibly helpful when I discovered I had left one of our suitcases on the baggage carousel at LGA, in making restaurant reservations at some of the top restaurants in the city, directions, etc.While we chalked this up to back luck, the bottom line is that we will stay elsewhere next trip.",Cincinnati,16,3.0

I had stayed at the Chicago property and thought it was amazing. Suffice to say, this hotel is still on top of its game without doubt. I called ahead to the Concierge (TAZ) to help make some special arrangements for my girlfriend's 30th birthday. From there on they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and appreciated. At check-in, without asking, I was given a double upgrade to a Grande Luxe room with a great view of 5th Avenue. It's interesting because #1 I know I didn't ask for one and #2 I paid a rate significantly less than advertised and that wasn't held against me. Everyone on the staff we came across wished my girlfriend a happy birthday. They sent up a cake our first night too. Amazing. The room was gorgeous, spacious as NY hotels go and perfect in every facet. The bathrooms are inviting and luxurious and above all, the hotel was so quiet at night you were guaranteed a restful sleep. On Saturday evening we were waiting for a cab as one approached. The doorman signaled to us and we stepped toward the cab only to be literally pushed out of the way by an obnoxious (and poorly dressed) individual who claimed he was waiting for one too. The doorman, like us, was a little surprised. Rather than make a spectacle, he let the man get in the cab and go. What he did next was the reason why i'm telling you all this. He summoned the chauffeur-driven forest green sparkling clean 7-series BMW that that the hotel keeps nearby. He apologized to us for someone else's rudeness and saw to it that we got to our destination on time, free of charge. THAT, my friends, is service above and beyond. In addition to all the above, the hotel even allowed us to store our Sprinkles cupcakes (3-dozen/they don't ship) in their freezer on the last night ahead of our early morning departure. EVERYONE in that hotel exuded class, polish and professionalism to the highest degree. I can tell you this hotel will make you want to return again and again. My sincerest compliments to everyone we came across on our stay. We had room 1417 which had a great view, was right off the elevator and wonderful in every aspect. The rooftop bar is not to be missed either. Drinks were creative and well put together and the scene is quite lively. I get to NY 2-3x per year and I can tell you the Peninsula will be my first choice next trip without doubt.","Naples, Florida",211,5.0

Clean and quiet rooms, friendly staff, unbelievable spa/sun deck, great food and awesome rooftop bar.

These factors combine with two other characteristics of the Peninsula to make the best in Manhattan: first, the unique location on Fifth Avenue in the middle of the shopping district surrounded by the top name stores and Rockefeller Center; and second, a concierge staff with fantastic connections and knowledge of Manhattan who can arrange almost anything with speed and flair.",Miami,27,5.0

We slept very well at this hotel.I liked the convenience of the electronic console that controls everything; lights, TV, telephone etc even the privacy option which mutes the doorbell.I wasn't able to connect to the free WiFi at first with my iPhone, but a call to the front desk fixed all that. An internet technician came to our room in a suit (everyone who works here is well dressed) and in minutes had it connected.Victoria at the concierge's desk was very helpful in her suggestions.The pool is small but it is located on the roof with windows offering great views of the building around. It was refreshing after a day of walking. At the pool, they have complimentary coffee/ tea, bottled water and apples.A visit to the sunroof is worth it as well (one floor below the pool).

The views are nice, as well.Fast forward to August of this year. I was there for drinks with five other people. The first round of drinks came quickly enough. And then a busboy picked up an empty....and another empty....and another empty....and soon no one at the table had a drink. I was watching the wait staff while this happened and saw three of them hanging out talking to each other, and one leaning on a table while talking with somebody else. Tired of the game, somebody at our table flagged one of them over and asked if we could have a refill.I don't know if something's gone down hill or not, but four staff should have seen that we were running low on $13 bottles of beer and $20 glasses of wine, or the busboy could have mentioned something to them.

Superb location, right in the middle of Manhattan just off 5th avenue of just south of Central Park. Very elegant, grand old style hotel with some lovely period features. Check-in quick and painless - apart from the constant handing out of $1 bills to various people who 'help' with your bags! Was in a standard room; asked for an upgrade and offerred to pay but the hotel was full. Room itself clean, but nothing special. Bed comfy but not on the large side. Bathroom fine, but lacking in amenities. Towels fairly miserable (though i left a small tip for the chambermaid the next day, and there was a marked improvement!), but again nothing too bad. Dreadful aspect though, looking into a dark courtyard so even during the day there was almost zero natural light. The room seemed to be in a 'new' wing. See below about the 'old' wing.Had dinner one night in the bar off the lobby, Fives. Very ordinary. I was jetlagged and in a weak moment ordered a pizza. Dreadful, especially for $20. The menu itself was poor, and the ambience of the place awful, like a business lounge in an airport. Staff were great though. Granted, it is all about the roof bar, but that isn't great either. Its FULL of tourists, the drinks are outrageous (4 beers, 1 soda, $95 with tip) and the view isn't that good. Overrated, with a lot more cooler, hipper and cheaper places to go. Again staff were fine, but they are working for tips so you come to expect this. I didn't go to the Gotham Lounge, which is oft touted in their website. Its tiny, and more of an after thought. Certainly not somewhere you'd be settling in for a few pints.Had a night in Boston mid-week, and when i came back i complained again about the standard room courtyard facing, but this time right by a/c units. They moved me to another room in the 'old' part of the hotel which was much nicer. View onto the church across the street; massive bathroom, nice lobby, proper bed, high ceilings. Might be worth the extra few dollars when booking. So overall, its a good hotel in a great location. If you can get a deal it certainly is worth it.

I would not hesitate to stay again. We had a deluxe room and our travel mates had a superior room. For the space difference, I would take the deluxe even with the price difference. You get a larger entry way, larger room and a huge bathroom. I love peninsula beds, they are really comfortable. We had an inward facing room, but this didn't bother us. The condition of the room and all facilities were excellent, clean and well-kept. The staff consistently greet you on your way in and out of the building. Everyone is very eager to please and provide excellent customer service. The only minor complaint I have is the front desk staff, while courteous and efficient, I found that we needed to ask questions to items I would have expected them to be more forthcoming with, for example, our room rate included many extras (breakfast, hotel credit, newspaper, etc.). However, the front desk personnel (two different people) did not alert us to any of this (us or our travel mates), we had to ask. It was nice to get our morning papers for example, when our travel mates did not (because they didn't know to request it). Very minor criticism though. The concierge staff, doormen, restaurant staff, and fitness center/spa/pool staff all went out of their way to provide their best service.The spa, pool and fitness center are top notch. We enjoyed taking a break from site-seeing and shopping by relaxing at the pool and exercising. The gym is great - all the equipment you will need in a nice environment. Water, coffee, tea, fruit, etc., all available on this floor. We enjoy the small touches and details. That is why we prefer Peninsula hotels around the world and this one does not disappoint.

Vanity set in the bathroom lacks alot of things, such as razor blade/toothbrush/comb etc.. 3. no coffee/tea maker or kettle in the room, thats quite important when you fancy a cup of coffee4. no iron and an ironing board in the room, most hotels have them in the cupboard i dont see why the peninsula doesnt have any, although there is ample space for it.5. Tv in the bathroom is tiny and can only be controlled from the entrance so your stuck with the same channel,look dont get me wrong, these things are petty and small, the hotel in general is good clean and upto the mark, so i like it, but with these cosmetic changes i am sure it will be more convienant to guests on their first or second stays,","Abu Dhabi, Uae",22,5.0

I am not a ""city girl"" (went for my husband's birthday) but surprisingly enjoyed the sunrise and sunset view from our room. The only issue we had was with the food. Sorry Peninsula - we just didn't enjoy it (food was bland/tasteless). We were exhausted the first night so we ordered room service; however, we then ate all other meals outside of the hotel. Its hard for me to pay for something or enjoy something that I feel that I prepare much better or improve upon at home. However, I've experienced this with a lot (but not all) of hotels.

The location is fantastic on 5th Ave, right in the heart of shopping and close to the Park and Theatre area, although a decent walk or short cab ride to Times Square. Car valet was immediate and pleasant and bags went right to room. Check in was also easy. Lobby is elegant and not stuffy in feeling. It is also relatively small. Great Christmas decorations. Our suite had a king BR plus living area with pull out couch and we also added a cot. It held 3 kids. We were extremely comfortable and ordered from room service 3 times. Not a huge selection but enough to get by and very good. Downside, but to be expected would be the price as breakfast could easily exceed $100-$150. Room size was good for NYC but not big. Room rate was reasonable value for . Outstanding roof top bar with great views of 5th Ave, perfect at night. Great selection of signature drinks but service was a tad slow. All other staff was extremely curteous and always attentive. Our car was delayed 40 minutes for departure and were immediately comped parking. The hotel was a wonderful place to retreat from the hustle of the city and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely return.","Newton, Massachusetts",5,5.0

Are you serious??? A BOTTLE costs $4.99 at Total Wine at various locations so I doubt the hotel pays any more than that. You want to charge $8 or $9 for a glass of wine and the bottle costs you $4.99 and it's NYC, I kind of get that, but $17 is a total rip off.We also had drinks earlier in the day at King Cole Bar and the prices were a lot more reasonable than at the Peninsula.

Plus we were heading to New York for Christmas how much better could it get?!Well, the rooms are smallish which is fine as after all we were in New York. The location was great, right on Fifth Avenue and 55th. The rooftop bar was fantastic as we sat there and had a drink watching it snow outside. However that is as good as it got.The service is appalling. I came in one day, freezing cold and carrying at least 10 bags of shopping. I struggled through the door as over 5 staff standing in the foyer just watched me struggling. I made a complaint to the manager who was a lovely woman and responded promptly to my complaint but one day later, the same thing happened again so obviously it is not a random act.Their mini service is fantastic though I have to say and their breakfast is great too. We actually ended up trying another hotel in New York - the Pierre which is a Taj Hotel and opposite Central Park. The rooms were not quite as nice as the Pen but were half the price and the staff MUCH kinder, more helpful and friendlier.We are heading back to New York and needless to say, we are not staying at the Pen this time which is unfortunate as we love the Pen in Hong Kong.

It is located at upper-east side in 5th Avenue, a couple of streets from FAO and Apple Store. The metro station is very near too.

My go-to hotel was booked as was my back up (which happens to be across the street) so I was lucky to get a room at the Peninsula. I've had drinks at the Gotham lounge a handful of times but this was my first time actually staying here. Front desk was a breeze and I was actually able to get my room about an hour and a half before check-in time. I had a Superior room and it was quite large (according to the site, 370sq/ft) very tastefully decorated. Modern, clean lines, stylish (not that tired minimalistic look) neutral tones... Not too much furniture to crowd the room. The view was a wall or some alley; nothing to look at basically but I wasnt there to peep out the window all day. VERY comfortable bed and linens. The bathroom was quite large but water managed to get everywhere when I showered, no matter how careful I was with the shower curtain. Soft and fluffy towels and bath robes. Overall I had a nice stay here. I did get a decent rate. But on the few occasions I though about staying here again Ive noticed sometimes that the price for a superior room can be outrageously overpriced (sometimes more than it's neighbor across 5th ave) I dont think I will stay often because of that - but I have no qualms about going to Gotham bar.","New York City, New York",31,4.0

All standard category room windows face a 1000 meter or higher brick wall a few feet from your room window. There is hardly any light at all and certainly not enough to use the room without the lights on.When you leave the hotel and go outside it as if you have escaped a prison cell and it takes a few minutes for your eyes to adjust to the light outside.The hotel calls this wall facing room their 'courtyard view room'. It is a misrepresentation in the extreme and whether you realise it or not the lack of light affects your well being over extended stays. I think I would have a pretty good basis of recovering some if not all of my money based on this misdescription and the consequent stress of staying in such a dark room for a week.Jason Ledoux (the Director of the Front Desk) could not be bothered to pick up the phone to help us work out what the alternative options might be but instead informed his staff that we could pay 300 USD extra a night to upgrade to the next room category (which also has much smaller windows than average for NYC hotels). My best feature of the hotel were its home brand of bathroom amenities as they seemed to be very gentle but effective. They were not available in the Spa areas only in the rooms.The gym is average for a 5 star hotel in NY. The entrance to the Spa Reception area is very clean and dimly lit but the pool area is dirty and slippery as are the ladies spa facilities and not maintained as you would expect from a hotel of this calibre.The Spa oversubscribes membership to non-hotel guests as the ladies steam/ sauna facilities were so busy that you would have to queue to use them- this is why there were benches to wait outside each one.In short, if you are looking for a nice relaxing stay in NYC filled with spa visits, and spending time together with your partner indoors or working in the room my recommendation would strongly be to find an alternative.",london,207,1.0

The concierge (Frederick) was incredibly helpful. From rose petals, to chilled champagne, to chocolate covered strawberries, it was all taken care of. I was greeted nicely by the staff as well. Service was fantastic and exactly what I expected.The room was also very nice, typical Peninsula quality. Luxurious, elegant, well appointed. I was in a suite and it was not very large (NYC hotels...) but again, it's what one would expect. One warning though...it's not cheap, but comparable to other top-tier hotels in NYC. I paid ~$1,000 per night for medium season and that was comparable to Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental. However, the location right on 5th Avenue was what ultimately won this over. The Four Seasons is also closer to 5th Ave but it's also on a busy 57th St. The Mandarien Oriental is further out of the way at Columbus Circle.

(Indeed, some we've stayed in don't even seem to care.) Not The Peninsula--at least not during our four night stay over Labor Day weekend. Admittedly, I'm a bit strange on how to spend travel money. On some things, I don't mind splurging, and on others I balk. As much as I loved the Peninsula, I had both reactions.The rooms, of course, are expensive--even if you get a bargin price on a Deluxe room promotion (as i did through Expedia). That, I didn't mind, because the room was beautiful! For a grande old hotel, it was thoroughly modern. The audio, HVAC, and lighting system was the most sophiticated I've seen in any hotel. All functions were controlled bedside in a dedicated remote control box. The buttons were backlit for night viewing, which lit only when the box sensed your hand movement over the box. How cool is that! The TV in the bath over the tub was likewise nice. And great kudo's to P. for including the Tennis Channel on their satellite system--great since the U.S. Open matches were carried mostly there during our stay. Thanks, Peninsula!I even splurged for the room service price of a pot of coffee for two, delivered quickly an in an excellent carafe that kept it hot. Yes, $20 for coffee for two is over the top, but I felt like royalty having it delivered. It's a nice feeling.But about balking: I just couldn't make myself pay their tab for breakfast. I get chinchy about prices of breakfast. So if you're like me and just want a simple breakfast, go down the street to Cafe Europa or its like.Service by the bell staff, check-in, and concierge team was superb. The restaurants they selected for us were all memorable. The hotel's location gave us great access to Broadway theaters, shopping, subway connections, and the park. (Travel Tip: it's not an unreasonable walk down Fifth Ave to the Morgan Library and Museum--well worth visiting!)If you like magnificent old hotels, not too large, with wonderful staff and very modernized rooms that maintain the historic charm, The Peninsula is a great choice.

All are located midtown--a rather touristy area, but filled with well regarded restaurants, shops and the Museum of Modern Art. It was a pleasant shock when the Pen appeared on my favourite private sale website as part of a package that was an amped of version of their own Summer Splendour package--it included a room upgrade, hotel credit and a yoga or personal training session (usually you choose one), plus breakfast. And the Pen ended up being a none too shabby place to be ""stuck"" while riding out Hurricane Irene, which extended our stay from 3 to 5 nights (the last 2 nights on the traditional Summer Splendour package)--we were fortunate the hotel had rooms available. The staff, which overall handled the situation with calm and grace, were also fortunate the hotel had rooms available, as some staff spent the night, with staff either unable to get home or come to work, as all public transportation was closed for awhile. Alas, there were some regrettable deficiencies concerning the front desk both pre and post hurricane--far from five-star--which I will address last.Upon entering the hotel, you are greeted by a doorman, page (in their signature Pen uniform), bellman and/or security person. The 3 story entry has a grand staircase and chandelier, with an exquisitely detailed ceiling and mouldings. The lobby is a series of jewel box-sized spaces. At entry level is a sitting room and a bell desk with a sitting area, as well as the entry hall to the Salon de Ning rooftop lounge elevator. Up the stairs to one side is the Fives restaurant and lounge (breakfast, lunch, dinner). To the other side is the Gotham Lounge (cocktails, light fare, afternoon tea) and then the reception area, concierge desk, small but well-equipped (and free) business center, another sitting area, and the guest elevators. There is free Wifi throughout the hotel. We lunched at Fives once, taking advantage of the Restaurant Week menu, and it was a tasty and hushed experience with great service.Our room on the 17th floor (20 floors with rooms) faced 55th St. It was categorized as a Grand Luxe, the largest of the regular rooms, but seemed smaller than the Grand Luxe room we had on a prior stay. That room faced 5th Ave. The rooms are pretty large by New York standards and elegantly appointed with high quality hard and soft furnishings. There is a very functional upholstered luggage bench in the entryway. The desk housed a fax machine and some office supplies. The bed was exquisite, with a bedside panel to control lights, temperature, TV, radio, etc. The television console also housed the minibar, fridge, and DVD player. The TV was not HD, and 3 remotes were needed to use it and the DVD--the in-room operating instructions were not accurate, so I had to call for help. The tech staff wear white lab coats. There was no iPod dock. There was a photo memory card reader to look at your photos on the TV screen, but it was old and could not read newer memory cards. The bathroom was large and all marble, with a separate tub and shower, TV over the tub, enclosed WC. Only one sink, but lots of counter space. We always had room service breakfasts and were particularly fond of the Chinese breakfast ($42). Room service ranged from outstanding (with every conceivable food item, utensil or seasoning on the tray) to good. Housekeeping was uniformly excellent day and night. The Pen is crowned, literally and figuratively, by the Spa on the 21st floor and the pool/fitness centre on the 22nd, with a newly opened Sun Terrace on the mezzanine between. The rooftop lounge the Salon de Ning is on the 23rd floor, reached by separate elevator. All of these spaces were closed for renovation during our last visit. The Spa, Sun Terrace and pool/fitness centre are outstanding in every way--design, decor, service, amenities, concept. Very Zen. They are all not too common features for New York hotels. The Spa was so serene and tranquil (and quite large)--I enjoyed a 2 hour Peninsula Ceremony involving hot jade stones the day before the night Irene hit, and also tried the relaxation lounge and steam room. The only drawback--no jacuzzi in either the spa or by the pool. The glass-enclosed pool is of decent size and functional for laps--it is not the large bathtub in the middle of a frenetic bar scene that one sees on ""hipper"" New York hotel rooftops. The adjacent fitness centre is well-equipped and fairly large, with a glass-enclosed studio for classes. Service everywhere was very attentive, and when the rain from Irene sprouted leaks and water buildup, the hotel staff was very quick to respond and address. The new-this-summer Sun Terrace is also beautiful. It wraps around 3 sides of the hotel and has fabulous open air views to the north, east and south, up and down 5th Ave. including Central Park. Wonderful teak chaises and tables with umbrellas done in shades of saffron and russet fill the terrace. Food and nonalcoholic drinks are available here or poolside ($39 bento boxes).We wanted to love the rooftop Salon de Ning lounge (formerly the PenTop Bar), but it was just okay. The space is meant to evoke a lounge in 1930's Shanghai, with some western touches. The small indoor bar area, with a smattering of tables, is lovely, but the 2 outdoor terraces just did not look as nice as the photos on the Pen's website, pre or post Irene. The glass walls look onto the same views that can be better seen from the Sun Terrace. The service was lackluster here, and the drinks, while yummy (tried the Ning Sling), are a pricey $22, with light fare in the $20-$30 range.The front desk was by far the biggest, really the only, disappointment to an otherwise wonderful stay. For 4 major interactions with reception, 3 were sub par.1) Check-in. A stark contrast to check-in at our last visit, an idyllic memory of perfection: Car arrives, doorman retrieves luggage from trunk, looks at name on luggage tag and announces it into headset. Upstairs at front desk, receptionist greets me by name and with a smile, says room is not ready. Receive phone call that room is ready, return to desk, same smiling gentleman escorts me to room and points out features. For this visit, it went: Taxi arrives, doorman retrieves luggage and asks my name, which he announces into headset. At reception, one staff member is with a guest, the second one looks at me without smiling or greeting me by name, actually without speaking, until I say I am checking in and give her my name. Check in then proceeds rather zombie-like, with minimal oral interaction, like someone in the 10th hour of an 8 hour shift, as if speaking was a source of great discomfort. The room is not ready. Later, a different staffer phones me that the room is ready and gives me the keys (with a smile!) but does not escort me. To be fair, I never saw a front desk person escort any guest to their room.2) Extending the stay. Once we discovered our flight was canceled, I went to the front desk to try to extend the stay. This was a positive experience--Sheron was very patient and thorough and was able to keep us in the same room using the Summer Splendour room upgrade. She said I would need to check out and check in again, as the 2nd stay would be a separate folio.3) Check-out/check-in. Another unsmiling staffer who was rather ruffled by the somewhat unique situation and required assistance. The interaction was perfunctory and formal, straight out of a training manual.4) Check out. Yet another unsmiling staffer. A charge from the first settled folio somehow ended up on the 2nd bill, but receipts etc. that I had for proof were packed away. Settling this involved help and a phone call. The charge was eventually dropped ""as a one time courtesy"", a politically correct way of saying ""I don't believe you, but we'll drop the charge so you'll go away""--not the nicest way or impression with which to leave the Pen or New York.Unpleasantries such as this have kept me away from other hotels (the Four Seasons Chicago specifically), but I don't think this will be the case with the Pen, not when everything else about the stay was so enjoyable. We'll just try to arrive later and avoid hurricanes next time.",Los Angeles CA,1201,4.0

The problem was that we were directly above the front entrance - very gloomy outlook.

Full disclosure, I did work at this hotel over five years ago though I currently have no affiliation with them. The staff no matter where you are in the hotel is excellent and professional. I called ahead of time to get pre-checked (I booked same day with Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts) and when we arrived I just had to give my ID and a credit card and everything else was ready. They offer dog amenities (dog bowl with food, water and a little dog bed). Because of the fine hotel program with amex we were double upgraded to a city view room. The room was comfortable with a king size bed, desk, tv/minibar/printer, dvd and chair. Bathroom is spacious with TV by the tub, shower, separate WC and two sinks. Lots of storage in the foyer. Because the person who checked me in didn't know me I certainly didn't get any special treatment (based on my previous work experience at this hotel). Kathleen and Anna at front desk and guest services were very helpful. Couple downside I have to note about the room. The bathtub, though ""cleaned"", still had one or two hair in it and when I grabbed the shower wand to clean it, there was a piece of a couple longer ones sort of wrapped around it. The bed headboard had a decent coat of dust on it (see photo). The TV's were installed at least 6-7 years ago and there is no HD, the remote control is really not efficient and the media plug in system needs to be updated to something more modern (no iPod input for iPad, etc to display on TV for example). On the plus side the hotel does have excellent wifi throughout the hotel for free (with download/upload speeds around 11mpbs).Room service is very fast, well presented but oh so expensive. A turkey club sandwich with a simple glass of water was over $50 (with all taxes and gratuities). $14 for a bowl of Kashi cereal with a box that probably retails for $3.99 at whole foods. Now I know this is a luxury hotel and you in another situation you would just walk out to starbucks but when you have no other options it's tough on your wallet. Had breakfast at Fives (Main restaurant). Excellent staff and service, prices are a little more reasonable and it's a very nice atmosphere overlooking 5th avenue. Prices are normal for the area. The Spa on the top floors is outstanding. Managed by ESPA (Mandarin and other hotels), it was very clean, had a pool, outdoor space (to use when there isn't a tropical storm) and large work out area with top of the line Technogym equipment. Steam room and large changing room with lockers. I did not have a treatment this time, though but a 60 min deep tissue for men is $195 and 90 min $295 (+taxes and 20% gratuity).We valet our car and I must say that for $60 per 24h you should have in and out privileges. The idea that if you have to take your car out you will get charged $120 for valet is ridiculous. The car is valet'd down the street by a private garage but they should renegociate that. Briefly used the concierge desk for one reservation for dinner but Taz was very helpful with that and we were set. One nice thing is that the hotel has a courtesy car to take you to a nearby location (not the airport so don't ask), it's first come, first served but given the downpour it was great to have that available. Also should you bring a pet, a page will gladly walk your dog if you are out of the hotel during the day or before you come home from dinner. I am not aware if there is a charge for this so please inquire first.","Los Angeles, California",114,4.0

I thought it would be an excellent opportunity for a quick family excursion. I spent a couple of days researching the Manhattan area for the best 'luxury value' and ran across the Peninsula. Relative to other similar status properties in the area, the Peninsula seemed to offer us the best price for accommodations for three (husband, wife, young adult daughter).I learned the hard way to follow the wisdom of the trip advisor crowd. Here's my story. Typically, I would have booked this hotel through my Amex Platinum Card Fine Resorts and Hotel program, but I found a much better value by calling the Peninsula's reservation desk. The reservationist arranged our accommodations, king with roll-away-bed at 'x' cost per night for a 2 night stay. Ultimately, they tried to run a scam on us and up sell us unknowingly. Because I planned to meet my family later in the evening after my business meeting, I arranged with the receptionist for my husband and daughter to check in prior to my arrival. I was assured that everything would be handled seamlessly. On check-in day, my husband and daughter checked in as planned and I arrived later to join them. I thought the room was lovely, facing 5th avenue, with windows that actually opened. While the decor was a little dated, we were comfortable, in a great location, and the room was fresh. Mind you, this is not the Peninsula Beverly Hill's which is one of the most perfect hotel experiences that we have ever had. As some of the reviews have suggested and I should have paid attention to, this is like the budget version of a true Peninsula.I digress, let me cut to the chase. On check out, there were problems with our billing that I took issue with. The bill was corrected, but a month later, Peninsula NY recharged the expenses to my credit card. I called them to challenge the charges and honestly, they put what sounded like a trainee on the phone who spoke to me in the most condescending manner. When I told him that I would hand the matter over to Amex and tried to end the contact (because honestly I was concerned that I was dealing with someone unstable), he tried to call me again a couple of times. I immediately phoned Amex and the situation was handled. I have never had such an insulting experience in all of my days and this was the Peninsula, or so I thought! I should have paid closer attention to all those trip advisor reports that were implicit of something shady going on at that place cause folks, it's true! I was holding on to a fond memory of the Peninsula Beverly Hills and the two are not the same!Bright spots: food was delicious, room adequate value (until they tried to rip me off). Mediocre: rooftop bar drink was pretty bad. I actually saw a couple of drinks returned.","New York City, New York",72,1.0

We were disappointed. Compared to the grand hotel feel of the Chicago hotel, the common areas of this property are small and unexceptional. As Amex platinum card holders, we have become accustomed to receiving sometimes very substantial room upgrades at their participating fine hotels. Not here. Although the hotel did not seem crowed on a March weekend, we were put in a standard fare room in the rear of the hotel with no view. While there, we didn't have to worry about being bothered with turn-down service there, because there was none. Despite being located right off Fifth Avenue, with thousands of cabs whirring by, having the bellmen actually secure you one can be a problem. The second time this happened while going to the theater, we were finally offered the house car, but at a charge three times that of a cab. Fearing that we would be late, we accepted. Finally, when I recently received my credit card statement an additional charge of $204 was listed from the hotel beyond the total given us at check out, and dated the day after we left. Upon inquiring, I was told that this was for limo service (although the charge for the just mentioned incident was on our bill at check out), and that they would have to look into the matter. They subsequently did leave a message stating that this had been a mistake, and that a credit would be issued. Probably innocent, but it did make us wonder how many such mistakes are made, and how closely some of their well healed clientele audits their bills. We did have a fine time in NYC, though, and are contemplating a return trip next year. This property will not be on our list of hotel options.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",13,3.0

There was neither doorman nor bellman at the front door when we arrived. We hauled our own bags up the stairs to the front desk. There we found the man on duty pulling on his suit jacket as he roused himself from sleep. That pretty much summed up the general level of service throughout the duration of our stay. When there were doormen and bellmen at the front door during the day, they were usually chatting together rather than opening doors and greeting guests. To be fair, the rooms were clean and the cleaning staff were very friendly. However, we noticed evidence of various cost-cutting measures throughout the hotel and the room itself was actually a bit tired and could use new paint. One high note: the refurbished spa and fitness center are very nice. The last night we were there, we got back to the hotel about midnight after a concert. Again, no doorman or security in sight. We were stopped by a bellman of some sort leading a group of people to the elevator. He abruptly asked us for our name and room number. Please!

When I questionned this - the manager confirmed that I'd not been upgraded and arranged for me to move the following day - whilst the mistake was rectified - it caused unnecessary disruption in having to move rooms. When I originally challenged the size of room, I was told that it was all they had by the receptionist - only for the manager to say that this was not the case.Additionally, breakfast was just OK - however they got the order wrong pretty much every morning.When I looked to extend my stay - the female receptionsist asked me to call reservations as she was busy - I tried to explain that I was looking to stay at her hotel - but she said she was too busy - I left my number for her to contact me when she got a spare moment - but she did not return my call.

We stayed at the Peninusla for the fisrt time. It was perfect in so many ways.

It was quiet, pristine, warm, comfortable and luxurious. In simple terms, the room was perfect! Oh, and the bed, so, so comfortable. We enjoyed the location as it allowed us to walk all around mid-town and was convienent to catch a cab or the subway. Each evening we migrated to the roof top bar and enjoyed the setting and views. NY at night is so beautiful and this space is perfect to enjoy the romance of the city lights. The drinks were delicious dispite the $22 cost per martini - yeah it was a lot, but we enjoyed as we got wrapped up in the mood and setting. I did not visit the Peninsula's spa, but am told by my partenr who did, that is was beautiful and completely relaxing.

If at all possible we stay at Peninsulas/Mandarin Orientals as they are hotel groups based in Hong Kong, our home city.We checked in at about 9.15 pm in late Dec, booking made through Amex Centurion. The Front Desk had a pre-printed form on which I was asked to sign. I noticed that apart from my name, all personal details were wrong: address, telephone number etc. I brought it to the attention of the lady at the Front Desk and she insisted that she had my address right and then rattled out a previous stay of that other person at Bangkok. Naturally I told her that I knew my address, that I had not stayed with them in Bangkok and that the hotel had me confused with some other person. She then put the blame on Amex (which Amex subsequently vindicated themselves). This person was nonchalant throughout. Not a smile or friendly word at check-in. I felt like bothering the matron of some public clinic at peak hour - although we were the only ones at check-in at the supposedly 5-star Peninsula and made no requests.Our booking was for a suite and were given exactly that. Nothing to complain about the room but nothing to write home about either. Certainly not the best in Peninsula terms, nor compared to Four Seasons/Mandarin Oriental, not even with Ritz Carlton or Park Hyatt properties. We quickly went to Fives for dinner, at about 9.30 pm. No customers in sight, but staff were slouching and chatting loudly. We stood at the entrance as is custom, and waited to be brought in and seated. No one made any approach despite noticing us. After a few minutes, we approached someone who looked like a captain and asked to be seated. He shrugged his shoulders and waved us to a table. I saw a used napkin bunched up right on the floor, 6 inches from my chair. No one bothered with it at all. We managed to catch the attention of the captain again and told him to please take our orders. He asked me and my husband for our orders and left, without asking what our son (11 years old) would be eating and swaggered off. We politely asked him to return and reminded him our son had not ordered, to which he said ""Oh, you want to eat? OK! What?"". My food tasted like airline economy food. My son's fish was so heavily salted it was inedible. I summoned the same captain, told him it was too salty and without a word, he swaggered off with the dish, never a word of ""sorry you don't this dish"" or ""would you like something else?"" We saw some other members of staff standing at the landing and eventually discovered that one of them was responsible for food and beverage. Told him of our experience. He was not surprised at all but courteous and apologized.We had breakfast every morning at Fives. Food was basically fine, as was service, since a different team worked the morning shift. Funny thing was that there was the Oriental Breakfast on the menu which my husband ordered and it included a selection of Asian tea from which to choose. Husband was asked to choose, so he picked one from the options on the menu. Response was that the hotel had run out of that one, and could my husband choose again? Of course, so he tried again. Sorry sir, this option is also out. More tries but no luck. Eventually, my husband asked them what they had stock, and that anything they had would be fine. The answer was ... (guess) they didn't have any! Husband said coffee would be fine too. But why the run-around?House-keeping was fine.Tea at the lounge downstairs was good. Concierge was not only unhelpful, but downright rude.When we checked out we settled the final bill, as usual. A final receipt was issued. Then, after about a month, another charge of US100+ appeared on our Amex Centurion statement. Not knowing what it was, I emailed the hotel inquiring what it concerned, marked for the attention of the Accounts Manager and Front Desk Manager. No response. The exercise was repeated at least 3 more times and there was never a response.Through Amex Centurion I called for details for the charge. Eventually, it turned out to be supposedly for one breakfast. Yet breakfast was included in the rate. In other words, the charge was totally unjustified. No response still from the hotel, after 8 months. For those used to true Peninsula service, especially at its flagship in Hong Kong, this hotel is a shame, a sad shame. Quite clearly, it is very badly managed,",Hong Kong,17,1.0

Their fitness center is amazing, their rooftop bar and restaurants are great, the rooms fairly sized and luxurious, and service is spectacular. Room: I was in a standard King room. While the size of it won't astound anyone, it was large enough to feel spacious. The king bed was great (read luxurious), and the bathroom was sizable with a large bathtub. I was initially annoyed by the centralized lighting system, but after awhile it grew on me. My room even had a tiny grilled balcony. The room itself lived up to my expectationsService: I guess the entire niche of the Peninsula is hiring mostly Asian staff, and they were all very friendly and efficient. The cleaning staff was talkative, the waiter at breakfast was especially boisterous (though mostly in a good way), and the concierge / reception were concertedly helpful in all inquiries we had. They were even gracious enough to grant us a very late checkout. Fruits (not very fresh) everyday, and free wireless internet rounds out the services providedFitness Center: Aside from a lack of some weight-lifting equipment (bench press) and heavier weights, this fitness center should be a model for other hotels. Cardio machines are all equipped with digital TV, ipod/iphone jack, and memory card slot. Cold towels and bottled water for guests, there is a studio open for guests to do yoga / stretch, and helpful personal trainers to give free advice when you need it. I was actually sad to leave it.Location: Very downtown. A 2 minute walk from MoMa, 10 minute walk from Times Square or Central Park, with everything to do and eat within walking or cabbing distance. I loved it.Restaurant / Bar: I only frequented the restaurant for breakfast, which was more than enough to give me an impression. For those wanting lobster for breakfast, the lobster and crab hash with poached egg is a good bet. Be warned that the dish is very filling... Also, the fruits even at the restaurant were not particularly fresh, one of the big downsides of the hotel. The rooftop bar (Salon de Ning - I think) has a nice view of the city, and standard drinks, but it is quite expensive!

The staff at the entrance, in the lobby, at the reception and concierge as well as at the Spa has been extreme polite but also discreet. Everything went smoothly without any kind of hiccups.

I have also stayed at the Peninsula Beverly Hills and I prefer the staff here in NYC - they are more polished and pleasant. While we were checking out I overheard a staff person at the front desk try to get a new chair for a guest because he had back problems. I live in the NYC area so I don't stay at city hotels that much (3 -6 times a year maybe) but this is my kind of place.

Stayed in a grand deluxe room which was spacious (did not get the Amex Platinum upgrade to jr exec suite as it wasn't available, which was a bit disappointing). Overall we found the room comfortable and quiet, but lacking in details. I had to call to get a child's robe (though they knew I was bringing him), room service completely messed up our dinner (I ordered a tomato basil pizza and we got some chicken disaster, for example). We chose to stay her because of the pool, and it was nice, although the first time we went up there were 2 lap swimmers and so not enough room for a little one to play - its pretty small. In hindsight I think the Mandarin would have been a better choice - also has a pool and I Think would be better for getting around to do the stuff with small kids (theater, cental park - parts of it- kind friendly restaurants, subway, etc). Our stay was fine but I probably wouldn't stay there again. And we LOVE the Peninsula in Chicago, but this isn't quite as polished.",chicago,5,4.0

Overall the room was very quiet, well appointed, good bed, amazing bathroom and comfortable space - if you are travelling alone. However, with 2 people in the room, it can become a little crowded as the room sizes are not that big. The bathroom is big - well appointed, but still lacking the small things - like bath salts. Most 5-star luxury chains provide this without request. Here, it is suggested that these products are available in the lobby shop! While the room was very satisfactory, the hotel was not. Let's start with the lobby - there is none. Build on 2-4 levels (depending where you are), the main area is broken up into a small seating area just off the entrance steps, then more steps to the 555 restaurant (very average food from very unhelpful staff), or the other steps up to the lobby cafe (over-priced food with no view and average service), or to the front desk area with always no more than 2 staff behind the counter (lines build up quickly and the staff appear to be new and not very polished in relations or experience), and finally to the elevator/another small seating area. Overall, this odd layout makes it difficult if: (i) you are disabled in the slightest and find stairs difficult, (ii) to find a comfortable place to relax and enjoy the ambiance and feel of the hotel, and (iii) to truly appreciate the hotel's grandness (on the opposite side of the building [facing 54th] there is a private club with just about the best looking room, ornately designed and feel of luxuriousness).The staff are almost there when compared to other luxury brands (such as the Mandarin Oriental or Four Seasons) - very inconsistent service, don't really know their guests (especially if you are there for several nights and leave and enter several times a day), and almost unfriendly attitudes. The best staff are the housekeeping who always greet guests in the hallways and always have a pleasant nature about themselves. The worse are the frontdoor staff - never greet guests (or appear to only greet certain types of guests) and never open doors (which I must say are rather heavy).Finally the amenities - odd way to get up to the pool (maybe get staff to wait by the pool for guests to sign in and not make guests sign in one floor below?), poor pool service (generally the other Peninsula properties would have staff come with cool glasses of water and lay out towels for guests who swim), good gym but generally no staff in sight - have to hunt them down, and the spa is dead quiet with staff standing around waiting for other staff to 'serve' you. Overall, this hotel (especially considering what their Hong Kong and Bangkok properties are like) lacks that unique luxury brand. What sets the Mandarin and Four Seasons from this property in NY is the poor guest service from staff. Of only the hotel would spend more time training and encouraging staff (perhaps with incentives?) to be more consistent and pleasant to guests, then maybe the hotel could live up to this well established name.",Toronto,149,3.0

The hotel did not negotiate any special rates but we stayed because we had been there before and to its sister hotel in Hong Kong, and were perfectly happy with our stays. On this occasion we felt things had slipped a bit and were somewhat impersonal. For example three days into the stay we had a note posted under the door asking when we were going to be checking out. I rang reception and explained that I had prepaid for 5 days and queried their letter. They said that they had made an administrative error. Their resolution was to give us some new keys to ensure we could get into the room for the rest of the stay. On that same evening we returned to hotel and decided to have a drink in the rooftop bar at 10.45pm. This was dark and noisy and really not what we wanted. We went to the small downstairs bar and were told that they were closed but we could get a drink from the minibar then. At £600 per night per room this reaction came at somewhat of a surprise. Perhaps it was because of the United Nations delegation or maybe it was a change of staff but the tight management edge seemed to have gone off this place.

This hotel was cozy and the staff was warm and friendly. Our experience exceeded our expectations!The rooms were impeccably clean and well-maintained. The decor is warmer than the FSNY. We had adjoining rooms which were well-suited to traveling with three children. Though the views of 55th and 5th Ave cannot rival views of Central Park on the higher floors of the FSNY, I would not hesitate to stay here again.The design of the hotel is such that it feels more intimate than the FSNY (though we love the FSNY's I.M. Pei designed entry). A friendly staff member stood ready at appropriate points to guide us to our destination be it the elevator for the stroller, the front desk, the rest rooms, or Fives (the restaurant). We were greeted by name as we passed the front desk in the mornings which was really a nice touch. This hotel also has a pool in a glass room with a view of Central Park and 5th Ave) which can be hard to find in NYC. This makes a great diversion for kids after an afternoon in the park or museums.The concierge gave us two great recommendations for lunch and dinner (Cafe Milan down the block for Italian during lunch and Cafe Fiorello on the upper west side). Things to consider for those traveling with children or who require wheeled access. Wheeled access entry is to the right of the main entrance (Salon De Ning entrance). A quick elevator ride takes you to the lobby where you need to transfer to the elevators which take you to the guest rooms. Once the rooftop bar opens (after 4pm in our case), a member of the staff from the bell desk must accompany hotel guests in the first quick elevator ride because the elevator goes directly to the roof. I can imagine that this might pose a challenge later in the evening (after 10pm) as the rooftop bar gets quite crowded and the line for the elevator would be longer. Since we are normally in by 9 pm, this was not normally a problem for us. Also, Fives did not have a children's menu to my knowledge (though I didn't ask either). There were plenty of suitable foods, but breakfast for my husband and me and our two older children easily reached a pretty penny even with the kids having cereal or a bagel and a bowl of fruit with their chocolate milk. This is a fantastic property! I recommend it highly and hope to stay here again in the future!","Richmond, Virginia",313,5.0

Having stayed at most of the top NYC hotels, we liked the Peninsula's elegance without glitz and its genuinely friendly staff. Some other hotels seem to have the philosophy that a snobbish attitude on the part of the staff lends an air of exclusivity; that just puts us off. Every single employee we encountered during our stay had a smile and a pleasant greeting, whether a maitre d' or a housekeeper. We always felt welcome and appreciated.The public areas were elegant, but a little bit dim due to the dark wood and olive green carpeting. Because the lobby areas are on multiple levels and the ceilings are somewhat low in some spots, the feel was intimate rather than awe-inspiring. It almost felt more like a private club than a hotel, with different places to sit and relax.Our room was upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and very quiet despite facing onto Fifth Avenue. We had a drink in the rooftop terrace bar but didn't have a chance to enjoy the outdoor lounge area as it started to rain as soon as we arrived. Service was quick and polite, which we were glad of as we were in a hurry to get to our restaurant for dinner. Breakfast was very nice, though with the incredibly high prices that seem to be the norm in New York these days despite the economy. A guest at a neighboring table actually had her unfinished bagel and lox packaged to go, and at $32 or so, I don't blame her.In all, we were very happy with the Peninsula and look forward to staying here again.","Bryn Mawr, PA",504,5.0

We ordered room service Saturday night. They wheeled a cart into our room, opened the wine bottle and set the dinner table for us. They really took the time to go beyond our expectations. I have stayed in many five star hotels and never received the service I did here. One bit of advice, take your swim suites. We didn’t but they have a pool on the 21st floor with a gym and spa that you shouldn’t miss. Yes the price is a bit more than other hotels but if you can fit it into your budget it is all worth it.

When my wife checked in, she was told there were no rooms available so they upgraded us from a superior room to a deluxe suite. The suite was very nice -- understated elegance and it seems that a deluxe suite is the same thing across the Peninsula chain, right down to the design of the bathrooms.Our main beef here is that the hotel lacks certain things that make it a first choice property. Fives restaurant is a bit cramped for fine dining if you don't get your own table and wind up along a row of cushions, the food was decent but by no means outstanding at dinner (ie: my wife's fish portion was small, desserts were mediocre), and certain aspects of quality control on the property are inconsistent (ie: bathroom scale was off by 21 pounds and obviously nobody is checking to reset them; hot chocolate came out white which the server noticed when he started pouring it). Breakfast bakery on the other hand was excellent and what you expect it to be.Great hotels are supposed to meet special requests. I wanted the sides from the salmon entree on my bass fish entree. There was no reason it wouldn't work. The chef didn't do it. Instead, I was served the item I had listed as an alternate but wasn't told until it was served to me.Another important point -- there are a lot of Asians staying here and Asians tend to smoke. I don't know if the property is a non-smoking property but I smelled tobacco when I got up in the morning and I don't like that.When we checked out, it emerged that my wife hadn't spent the $50 spa credit because she couldn't get an appointment that was mutually convenient. The front desk manager offered us a $30 certificate. I said that we live in the neighborhood, that the spa treatments are rather pricey here (ie: $195 for a 60 minute facial plus tax and tip) and that for 2 certificates (they have them in denominations of $30) we would use it. He declined and therefore lost $200 in revenue from us since he wouldn't extend an extra $30. I didn't think this was very managerially smart and it probably helps explain why this property is just not up to par with its peers. If I were choosing a 5 star property in Manhattan, I'd try something else before I returned to the Peninsula.

The pool is nice, but nothing special, CERTAINLY NOTHING to compare with the luxury of Bayerische Hof in Munich, for example, where it is so lavishly appointed, with the sliding roof that opens on a nice day...Definitely Peninsula pales in comparison to its European top-of-the-line sisters.

What I am trying to get across is that this is truly a quality place to base your NYC trip from, and has been so for my family since it opened a few years ago. Last time it was truly an amazing visit as one of my son's biggest corporate profiles from Swedbank Markets shared breakfast with us this morning, a worthy getaway from the usual crowd. Among the interesting things, we even shook hands with Swedbank's new CEO Michael Wolf. The concierge is also very helpful, arranged atable at Bungalow 8 tonight for me and my friends.Warmly recommended!","Orange County, California",100,5.0

The normal rate is hideously expensive, but getting the second night for $20 made it only ""very"" expensive.It was definitely worth the expense, though. Beginning with the doorman who anticipated our arrival and greeted me by name, there was a genuine welcome extended. I was traveling with my wife & daughter, the latter enjoying a birthday shopping trip to New York. The front desk had upgraded us to a Junior Suite to make room for three, and when we got to the room, we found another treat. They had placed a bottle of champaigne and a personalized birthday cake for my daughter in the room!Throughout our stay the concierge helped with museum tickets, dinner advice/reservations and shopping guidance. We were treated like ""VIP's"" ... not at all like a family who could only afford to stay there on a special deal.  The Gotham Lounge in the lobby was a very nice place to relax over drinks or coffee. They also served 'high tea' which looked good, though we did not partake. There was also a penthouse bar, but that was the only negative about the whole stay. It was tawdry and ""cheap"" looking ... the decor lacked only a dancing pole to achieve the effect they appeared to be striving for. Fortunately, it is easy to avoid.","Austin, Texas",117,5.0

Yum!The roof top bar is very nice.It's outside terrace was still in use with the early november temperatures being so mild.It tends to be busy which is always a good sign.The new pool and fitness centre are also a big plus.Getting now to the major flaw during our stay and it's a big one in my opinion at a property of this stature.We found the concierge service to be very patchy.The first time I contacted them by phone from the room,I was told they would be there in 5 minutes [albeit at 730am].The next time I rang an hour later,I was put on hold for 10 minutes..before having to hang up-that was dreadfull!So then to the desk in person...We were greeted by a surly tired going through the motions representative.It was disappointing.Later in the stay,we asked for a comment on a specefic restaurant and were advised that we would need a months advance reservation.. [At most high end hotels I stay at I ask the concierge to do these kind of bookings because I expect them to be recognised at the restaurant rather than us trying on our own].We walked down to try ourselves anyway and were accomadated.So there you have it,I'm giving the pen NY's concierge team a C minus..but to be fair to the hotel as a whole this was an exception.It is however a serious flaw from our experience.Moving on...Afternoon Tea in the Gotham lounge is to be highly recommended-excelent service and a very friendly host.Another great plus with the Pen [Though I haven't reviewed it here due to time considerations,we loved also the Pen in Chicago!] is the free wifi and the complimentary business centre pc's with internet.Other high end hotels take note-there are ways to police over use/hogging of the business centre besides charging the earth for it.Othe hotels also take note that complimentary wifi at the type of prices charged at luxury hotels is to be expected!!All things considered then, staying at the Pen was a good experience and to be recommended.","Bray, Ireland",74,4.0

The remaining nights were spent at the Four Seasons, reviewed separately.I last stayed here about 20 years ago and remember the hotel being intimate and elegant. I recall my room being petite and dark, as was the bathroom, with an interior view. About 10 years ago , the hotel underwent a massive renovation with rooms reconfigured and a spa, pool and bar placed rooftop. The spa, pool and Pen Top Bar are again being renovated; this fact was made clear several times during the reservation process.My short stay was a joy. The hotel is in a historic Beaux Arts building on 5th and 55th, across the street from the equally elegant, also Beaux Arts St. Regis hotel, where I have also stayed. The Four Seasons, by contrast, is modern and grand in design. The Pen's lobby seemed unchanged from my last visit. The reception area is still intimate, the service top-notch. I arrived quite early and a room was not immediately available, but I was contacted by cell by 11:30 am when my room was ready.I requested and received a room facing 5th Ave. and thus had a lot of natural light. The room was either a Deluxe or Grand Luxe--not especially large but elegant and well-appointed furniture-wise and technologically. There was the signature Peninsula bedside phone console that controls all the lights, air temp, and everything else. I loved the outdoor temperature indicator by the door. The TV was plasma/flat with DVD player and also a gadget that accepts your digital camera memory card for viewing your photos on the big screen. Alas, I could not get this to work.While the St. Regis has thier butlers, the Pen has its distinctly uniformed pages to meet your every need. While the spal and pool are closed, there is a makeshift fitness center (2 converted hotel rooms), and there is access to a nearby health club with pool, which I did not use.The Pen has one restaurant and 2 lounges (plus the closed Pen Top), while the St. Regis has 2 restaurants (one with celebrity chef Alain Ducasse) and one lounge (King Cole Bar). Choosing between the Pen and St. Regis is a difficult choice with no clear front runner in my opinion.I have visited/stayed at 3 other Peninsulas--Hong Kong, Beverly Hills and Chicago. All are elegant with exemplary service, with HK and Chicago being grand, and BH and NY much more intimate.

Truly nothing special about the rooms or lobby. You walk in are faced with 3 stairways that don't really go anywhere. There were some problems too. The room (a deluxe king) was quite small and had poor ventilation. The room was hot (in January in NYC) with the AC on max and the window open.

However, it feels just like a hotel. When we pay this much I expect to really feel special. We had a 2 bedroom suite with a living room. We could not get the electronics to work in the living room. My husband is in the electronics industry and could not get it to work. It took someone about 45 minutes to come help us and he has problems as well. Once he got it working he recommeded that we not turn it off, but just turn down the volume when not using. However, housekeeping did and we had to go through the entire thing again the next day. This time my husband helped the staff member set the equipment up correctly so that it would work right! We should have received a discount on our stay!The Spa is very nice, however it does not go above and beyond. It wasn't quite what you would expect for a Spa at the Peninsula. I thought my massage therapist was just average. My facial was above average. It seems that the spa/workout facility allows NYC residents to join and the staff treated them better and I felt like an intruder at their gym.The Pen-Top bar is definitely a hot spot in NYC and is a stop for business people for happy hour. This was huge perk since we were traveling with another young couple for a fun getaway trip. It was fun to be able to go up and get a drink in such a happening setting. The host was wonderful and remembered us each time we went (every night!).I found the rest of the staff below average for this type of hotel. My spa treatments were included on our package and were on the bill. Our breakfasts were included on our package and were on the bill. It took over a hour to try to fix the bill and I don't think it was ever correct. However, we were going to miss our flight if we didn't leave so I just gave up. I tried to review it once home, however could not figure out their coding, etc. I have never had this be a problem at this caliber of a hotel.

This was our second stay at the hotel, and ironically we were in the same room on the 9th floor.

The location is absolutely incredible if you want to be able to explore 5th Ave. without having to hike a half mile just to get there. Only the St. Regis across the street has a comparable location. It's also close enough to the theaters in Broadway to walk comfortably. Rooms are quite large, are very quiet and have very nice bathrooms. Our room faced the church across 55th Street and unfortunately this was not a particularly memorable view. Not terrible, but not great. Service is excellent. There was some confusion over a special bed-making request - blankets instead of the duvet. It took them 3 nights to get it right, which was a little irritating. We only ate breakfast at the Peninsula, but that was a highlight of each day. Sitting next to the window looking down on 5th Ave. is pretty memorable.

But for this money it needs to be off-the-scale great, and I really don't think it is that.I was travelling on a client's corporate package, and was paying $700+ a night, which I guess is towards the cheaper end of things at the Peninsula, but even so I would expect a room from which I can see daylight. My balcony gave onto the brick-faced light-well, with 15 floors above me, and I existed in an all-day grey gloom: it was like living in the video-game Silent Hill. The room decor is fine, and comfortable, but pretty uninspired and certainly not distinctive in any way: I could have been in a Marriott in any town or state. And surely for $700, I could get bath-salts included in the room-price, rather than having to pay $10 from the mini-bar for them?As I mentioned, there are plenty of good points, and in fact the moment I stepped out of my room I started to understand how I could be paying so much. But for me, the room is at the heart of a hotel experience, and this didn't quite cut the mustard. It's good but for this money good is not quite enough.

It was a good size and we fitted an extra bed for our daughter in without compromising the space. The extra bed was a “proper” one and not a foldaway or camp style bed! The bathroom was nice with views toward the Hudson and had a large sink area with separate bath, shower (with seat) and loo. Apparently the hotel started life around the turn of the century as the Gotham and the lobby and bars keep the Edwardian look and feel.The Spa and Pool are on floors 21 to 23 and have been added onto the top of the original hotel. The pool offered excellent views around New York and was very child friendly with lots of attentive staff and complimentary tea, coffee and water. The changing rooms offer every available toiletry and hair accessory in a well staffed spa area, even down to sliced cucumber for your eyes! The hotel has 3 bars and one restaurant. We found the roof top bar very busy with “business people” on our only visit so we stayed downstairs for the rest of the time. We ate in “Fives”, their restaurant, on our first night ~ it was OK but lacked atmosphere and was almost empty then and on every other occasion we ever saw it. The adjoining Fives Bar overlooks 5th Avenue (hence the name!) and is very modern in style. You can eat there but it wasn’t overly comfortable. Our preference was for the Gotham Bar. It was more lounge style and you could get good snacks in it. It was never empty but equally never too crowded. Away from the hotel we found a really good Italian restaurant just opposite the hotel on 55th Street called Il Corso, which was recommended by the ever so helpful concierge. It is only small but has tremendous character, good food and feels very “New York”. I was waiting for the Godfather to walk in at any moment (actually I’m not sure he wasn’t already sitting at the table next to us!) We also ate at Del Frisco’s Steak House on 6th Avenue but were not very impressed. It was big, modern, noisy, expensive and the steaks lacked flavour. On advice we didn’t go up the Empire State building but went to the Top of the Rock on the nearby Rockefeller Building. It was great, only 10 minutes walk from the Hotel, no queues and had a view of the Empire State Building (!) among others and you could stay as long as you like. We heard from others that the Empire State Building got very busy, and you were given a limited time. Another point is if you are up the Empire State Building, you can’t see the Empire State Building!!! There is an excellent ""French style"" restaurant on the edge of the square at the bottom called Brasserie Ruhlmann. The special Lobster bisque and seared tuna were superb. The concierge was pushing “Circle Line” boat trips to visit the Statue of Liberty but we ended up getting a $20 cab the end of Manhattan Island where could walk past the Twin Towers site and then down to Battery Park. We took a Yellow Taxi boat that went around the end of Manhattan and the back up past Ellis Island, Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge, stopping for photo opportunities! It cost around $15 each and you could get off at the Brooklyn bridge area, as we did, where there is a shopping area and some other sightseeing opportunities. We also took the horse and Buggy round Central Park which is both traditional and a good way to see it, especially if you are pushed for time.If you are going to New York, particularly with children, then we would recommend the Peninsula. It is in a good location, a fine mix of traditional and modern and with nice, friendly and attentive staff.","Holmfirth, United Kingdom",206,5.0

I took my 15 yr old daughter. I was a little reluctant because there were so few reviews and not all were great. I was trying to decide between the Trump and the Peninsula. I chose the Peninsula for the old world charm. I'm so glad I did. There was no comparison.It was truly one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. Everything was perfect. The room was huge. We had a deluxe room on the 20th floor over looking a church. I entered the room, into a large dressing room/entry. Past this room was the bedroom--also huge. To the right of the entry was a beautiful bathroom, flat screen TV over the tub and far enough away from the bedroom that you never knew if the other person was even in it. In most hotel rooms the bathroom is so close to the bedroom,The service was excellent. Anything I asked for I had within 5 minutes, regardless of the time of day or night. On the wall, by the door, the outside temp and humidity is displayed. One person on tripadvisor complained about setting the temp in the room. The control is on the phone and does not display a number. I'm not sure why this would be an issue. I often have trouble getting a hotel room cool enough at night and had no trouble here.We met friends in the lovely lobby--there are several. We had drinks on the spectacular roof top bar. You could see up and down 5th Avenue. The locatin was incredible. Everything was close. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. Even my 15 yr old daughter was in awe and she's been to some pretty amazing places all over the world.

We also loved the fact that we were given complimentary mineral water which was needed in the 90+ heat. We did however have a couple of criticisms, one being that the restaurant closed for every evening in August and the other being that the concierge did not always have the correct times of ferries etc, other than these points we were thrilled and would definately go back again.","Hertfordshire, England",14,5.0

What once was a grand and glorious example of five-star luxury has apparently deteriorated to a point which will require a major intervention. I deliberately avoided writing anything here (I stayed nearly a year ago) out of sheer apathy...which, I'm sorry to say, reflected the apathy of the Peninsula's hospitality staff. This gleaming bastion of old-world elegance and grace on Fifth Avenue now contains an establishment trumped by dozens of three-star hotels at one fifth the cost. Between the condition of my bland room, which had a dingy, motelesque bathroom, tired, worn, perforated furnishings, and smelled faintly of mildew...and the apathetic staff...not to mention the horrible, overcooked, overpriced room service fare, this hotel made me glad to check out at the end of my two-night business stay. Out of courtesy and sheer exhaustion from travel, I did not ask to change my room as I did at the W hotel in July. ""But this is the Peninsula!"", I kept telling myself along the way...""...it has to get better!"". However, optimism languished through the first night into the realm of ""coulda, shoulda, woulda."". What left a particularly sour taste in my mouth is that when I repeatedly made an earnest attempt to comment to the staff of my observations, i was met with blank stares and inferences that the management didn't give two toenails who complained. I tried to keep an open mind after I returned home and wrote a letter to the manager, trying not to sound like an embittered young whippersnapper, but rather an experienced traveler offering constructive criticism. I received no response...in truth, I nearly forgot the whole thing happened until I stumbled upon a copy of my letter last night. Travelers, be forewarned. For this kind of money, you are entitled to a really special New York experience, not the most ordinary hotel that has rested on its laurels to the point where it seems to get by on its name alone. Go to the Essex House where the folks love their jobs and you'll get the best sleep ever. Go to the Trump, where you'll feel like a celebrity. Go online and get a great rate at the Four Seasons, where everything is designed to pamper. Get a suite at the W Court, which feels like your own exclusive apartment in the city...all for probably less than I paid for my Peninsula debacle.","Philadelphia, PA",40,1.0

The location is central to shopping on 5th and Madison. I was planning on staying at the Ritz or 4 Seasons, but stayed here based on a friend's recommendation.The first turnoff was the rather rude reception at check-in. She did nothing to make you feel welcomed, not even a hello or smile. At least the Ritz or 4-S's they muster up a smile and friendly hello, even if it's not sincere. The room was ok; The plasma tv was the highlight. The bathrooms were nice. Comparable to the nicier hotels I've stayed at. The cost of room service was beyond an exceptable amount, even for the high end hotels. I don't mind paying the normal overpriced room service cost at the Ritz and Four Season's, but for what I got here, it was beyond overpriced. The bed was not comfortable at all.They need to do something about their quality of beds. Unfortunately, checked out with the same rude front desk girl and pretty much decided not to come back again.
