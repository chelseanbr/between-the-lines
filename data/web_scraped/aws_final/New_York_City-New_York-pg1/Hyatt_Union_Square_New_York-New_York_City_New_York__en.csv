The noise of the elevator should not be a new problem, but they told me ""we have chosen a very nice room for you! Enjoy your stay!"". I did not sleep well the first night wondering what that noise was, but too lazy to pack everything and call front desk to change room at late night. The second night I called the front desk to change room, she was surprised how loud it was since she could hear the noise even from the phone. I think the right thing to do is: if that was the only room left, they should have told me about this condition, instead of hoping I wouldn't notice. If this was not the only room left, then an alternative room should have been prioritized. Since this was not what happended, I can only infer that either the person who checked me in didn't know the situation of the elevator, which makes him not a professional employee, or he did this on purpose to get rid of a bad room, which is even more unacceptable.

I’m a solo adult traveler who used to live in New York so I can’t speak from a true tourist perspective. But I think the location is excellent. You’re south of the midtown connection, but shopping and conveniences is only around the corner (DSW, Nordstrom Rack, MAC, Whole Foods a block away, higher end only a few more). Subway station is both local and express stop so easy to get around). And taxis are about as plentiful there as you’re going to get most times of day). I usually prefer something in Soho or Tribeca like Soho Grand or Sixty Thompson but I found this hotel have a cozier more personal feel than you’d associate with a big chain. I liked the fact there was enough space in the lobby to meet a friend or sit for a moment plus a full restaurant and bar. The room was not particularly remarkable with regard to decor, but I still thought definitely better than average. Love that you can still get a coffee maker in the room. Tiny niggling thing was I wish they’d update outlets to have more USB ports. Pharmacopia amenities were great, bed was comfortable, room size was pretty good for New York, I’ve definitely, definitely, paid more for smaller. Room service burger and fries were very good. Far and away the front desk staff was great. I wish I had caught their names. (Whoever was on desk from 13-19 December.).

This Hyatt has been very clever with their limited space and created what feels like a spacious room through streamlined, efficient design. My king room featured a robe and slippers, and an umbrella just in case. The ""closet"" is actually an in-room wardrobe with space to hang but no drawers to store smaller things, so I folded and piled my non-hangables on the taller part of the closet that held the safe and a smaller drawer below that (drawer-height, minus the drawers). Wall hooks by the door were a nice place to store my coat and purse. There are a lot of outlets in all the right places, the stand-up shower was spacious and modern with ok pressure and consistent temperature control. There is a sideboard-type table that holds a fridge on one side and the coffee maker on the other (mine was broken but they sent up a free pot in the morning and got me a replacement the next day). Real glass glasses (two sizes plus two wine glasses), a wine opener, and a nice desk setup helped make the space feel pretty cozy. There aren't a lot of surfaces to set things without clutter quickly taking over, but there is a bench seat as well as a desk chair and a carry-on stows nicely in the area under the TV.Cons: The blackout curtain didn't lay flush with the walls so my east-facing window bled sunshine on my last morning (fortunately, it had been cloudy most of the trip). The pillows are down and a little too firm for my taste, and the HVAC doesn't run constantly so if you are a light sleeper, BRING A NOISE MACHINE OR AN APP because NYC is loud all the time. The hotel knows this, so earplugs are provided in the valet kit on the sink. Not much neighbor noise at all but the street is always going. My noise machine worked like a charm.I was alone on business but I can't imagine trying to stay here with another person. There's exactly enough room for one person's stuff for a short amount of time. This hotel is not for long stays, in my opinion. I will stay here again when I travel back to NYC though, it was perfect for me.Close to all public transit, a block from Union Square, and perfectly located for nice long walks to Midtown and the Village.

The bed was incredibly comfortable, blackout shades for privacy and light blocking.

There are also white noise devices in the room, comfortable fleece bathrobes, and the alarm clocks are now Bluetooth speakers with wireless charging capabilities. The Hyatt staff was warm and accommodating each time I interacted with them and had excellent advice for directions or recommending places to eat in the area. Bowery Restaurant and Library of Distilled Spirits were also terrific options and the staff was fantastic at each establishment.

Alisha, at the front desk, had apparently drawn the shortest straw, and was patiently taking in a woman’s unhinged rant about her treatment. She wasn’t a guest mind you. Just how the world has been treating her. Paranoid and wounded, she kept up a relentless barrage. Alisha remained patient, fair and firm with her, giving her the space to unburden herself. Things changed when the woman decided that I had made a crack about her smoking. Uh, what? And all of a sudden she was making comments about me as I waited to be checked in. This is when I saw an interesting shift in Alisha. She got very stern with the woman, and said she was not to bother our guests. The woman protested, and Alisha was having none of the fake “what? Me?”.I wasn’t exactly bothered as I understood that this woman had something going on. But Alisha made sure that the drama didn’t spill into my experience. To me, in addition to the deft people skills, it showed Alisha’s strength in personality and commitment to ensure things go smoothly for guests. It could have easily been an eye-rolling experience.

There was an issue with the canceling of my car from the airport, after finding out it would cost me $95 one way, I canceled the car with the HYATT but the customer agent didn’t cancel and didn’t really offer an reason why other than miscommunication. WHAT MISCOMMUNICATIONS? I Asked BRIANNA to cancel the car because I found other transportation cheaper. So, I was out of $200 for transportation and no one seemed to care. Ms. Brianna did say she called the air link transportation company and they said they would give me a partial refund but I won’t hold my breath. Ms. Brianna was a lot nicer than the young lady that checked me in though. I never got her name. The trip to NY was overwhelming too expensive and too many people. If I EVER stepped foot back into NY I would probably give the Hyatt another chance it’s close to everything and I would like a bigger room with a view. My daughter wanted to see the Statue of Liberty and was accomplished that so all is good. She’s 7 and will probably remember this forever. ",,0,3.0

Located right at Union Square and close to the Flatiron district, the hotel location is the greatest plus - convenience stores such as Walgreen's are just steps away and there are all kinds of great restaurants within walking distance. Maison Kaiser, an all-day breakfast and pastries eatery, is just a block away. There's a Starbucks about two blocks away and an all-day Chinese dim-sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan just half a block away. Reputable restaurants such as Gramercy Tavern, East 15th and the Union Square Cafe are all within walking distance.The hotel's restaurant The Bowery Club did not have good breakfast (limited menu and bad coffee) but the Cobb Salad during dinner time was very good and reasonably priced. The hotel bar is actually quite beautiful and exotic during quiet times, but for most evenings, the bar was extremely noisy particularly during weeknights. The bar does not take reservations and good luck with finding a table. Drinks were good but very expensive!At about USD$400 per night, the room was good value for money for a Manhattan Hotel. There's free Premium Wi-Fi (maybe because I'm a World of Hyatt member) everywhere for up to three devices anywhere in the hotel. I also had 2 free bottles of Evian water every day. I opted for the King-Bed room facing the Courtyard and the backs of other nearby buildings because the hotel is located near a fire station and I wanted to be free from sirens of fire trucks. The room was small but quite well equipped with sufficient closet space and drawers even with a big hotel umbrella inside the closet. The bathroom shower offered good water pressure but the water often overflowed beyond the shower stall if the door was not closed tightly. I particularly liked the edgy bathrobe with a hood - very nicely designed and hip! The King bed was comfortable but I missed my mini-fridge where I could have put my purchased fruits from Walgreen's. There was no doorman and no washroom in the lobby but front desk staff were always helpful and friendly.My only complaint was that housekeeping staff, though conscientious, did not speak English well enough to understand my specific needs. The hotel also needs to change the duvets as I've discovered a blood stain on mine one night. A renovation might also be timely as my room looked quite tired and overall lighting was too dark.Hyatt has recently changed its policy that making local calls from the room is no longer free. I never received any email about this policy change from the World of Hyatt and when I called reception, they told me it's still free. When I checked my bill prior to check-out, all my calls were charged $1 each plus telecommunications tax. When I complained that reception had told me a different story and they immediately apologized and took all those charges away from my bill.Location location location was the biggest attribute of this hotel. Overall I was quite happy with my stay and would definitely consider going back on my next trip.","Toronto, Canada",14,4.0

Btw I was also told the fan speed in the room can’t be adjusted on the top floors (over a period of 24 hrs received various versions) and while I was “parked” in another room for 4hrs the speed was easily adjustable. So either full blowing A/C in your face while you sleep or turning it off are the only two options supposedly for the top floor. Very disappointed how staff handled solutions. Only one manger from maintenance was somewhat helpful after we can back to a 90 degree room with heat running full speed (after I was supposedly fixed).

Staff was courteous and overall service was good. F&B is provided by a 3rd party contractor that does only a mediocre job. This is a drawback to this hotel because the contractor does not have ""Hyatt standards"". The problem I had was trusting the 4-hour Express dry cleaning service. I double-checked with Guest Services that 4 hours was ""in play"" before submitting slacks I needed for that evening. I was assured I would receive the order in 4 hours. I did not receive the dry cleaning in 4 hours, or 5 hours, or even that entire evening. They were brought to me the next morning a 6.30am - knocking on my door and waking me up despite my ""do not disturb"" sign. That was very frustrating as nothing annoys me more than being promised something that can't be delivered. It would have been better to tell me 4 hours was not available. I could have then pressed the slacks myself. But in making a promise to me and breaking it, I had to cancel my plans that evening. It was very inconsiderate.","Toronto, Canada",19,3.0

The bed was very comfortable and overall the room and bathroom were clean. We were on a high floor and could definitely hear every noise on the street below, but the street noise was quiet enough after midnight to get a good night of sleep. Our only real issues with the room were some issues with the bathroom features and overall room lighting. Our bathroom did not have any counter space - at all. It was all sink, so while getting ready in the morning, everything had to go in the sink. There also wasn't anywhere to hang the hand towel near the sink. The lighting in the room was very minimal to begin with and one of the main lights in our room was broken during the duration of our stay which made the entire room very dark. The light in the bathroom was also minimal which made it very difficult to even put makeup on.

After some discussion I was assured that we would get connecting rooms and I received an email confirming this. A week before our arrival called to confirm and this is when some issues started - once you have a reservation, it is basically impossible to talk to a live representative-all automated responses. Tried to reach a representative a day before arrival - same result. And of course when we arrived (was not late at night) - we heard from the front desk “we gave all connecting rooms to other guests”. I tried to explain to the front desk person that we had booked in advance, showed her the email confirmation but this was useless. She was so rude and did not even try to pretend that she cared and wanted to help. She actually started lecturing me how hotels around the world worked and none could guarantee connecting rooms and some other non-sense. I asked to talk to the manager on duty. Same result (at least he was not rude). Finally he promised to move us to connecting rooms next day (we booked for 5 nights). Of course nothing happened next day. They really do not care and this is not a cheap hotel to explain such attitude.

I stop in for business, but to also visit my children going to college nearby so the Hyatt Union Square hits all the musts for me. It is hip enough for my kids and their friends to visit us at, the restaurant is high quality and provides thoughtful dishes my choosy socially conscious crew would want and the Distillery Library next door has 700 bottles to choose from for after dinner drinks (pre going out). The staff are not pretentious, but still pay attention to service and detail which makes me feel like a welcome valued guest.

Highly recommend. Ear plugs in cute little pouch on pillow was a nice touch but I didn't need them. Rooms and bathrooms were updated nicely. Pocket doors allow for more room in the bathroom and they don't skimp on towels. Slippers and nice robe for use. I read reviews that complained about the housekeeping. They leave a card in the room that clearly states how often your room will be cleaned and that it can be at any time between 9-6pm. If people read that stuff they wouldn't post negative comments.

The only issue was lack of storage space - we had a hard time finding ways to organize our clothes and other items. Otherwise, it felt like enough space for a couple.

The shower has a frosted glass door but it is not completely private and is open to the rest of the room.

The bed was comfortable and we did not find the street noise too loud (we were on the 10th floor). We had room service a couple times; it was delicious and very fast.

Our first one stopped working altogether; we got a second one and it worked but didn't brew complete cups and leaked occasionally.We stayed in an Urbane Sky room.

It was a nice change from the big hotels in midtown Manhattan. Subway stops were within steps of the hotel, as was the Union Square Green Market, a Whole Foods, a great NYC bookstore, and multiple restaurants.The accommodation was okay. The decor was stylish; the room was where-do-I-put-my-bags small--perhaps not unusual for NYC. Some of the design elements in the room were not particularly well-thought-out: the closet, for instance, was so small that it could barely hold one person's hanging clothes for 2 days, much less clothing for two. The room needed more drawers; better furniture could have easily solved for that. On the plus side, there were plenty of plugs, and the lighting was well-designed.The sleep quality was average. While the bed and linens were comfortable, our room was facing the street, and the noise control was very poor. Admittedly, NYC is a loud city, but I have stayed in several properties that were better insulated against street noise. Tons of sirens, etc., all night long--if you're a light sleeper, consider staying elsewhere or at least requesting a room that does not face the street.Housekeeping was very disappointing. On the day I checked-in, soap was provided for the shower, but not for the sink. On the next day, we left the room at 9:00a; when we returned to the hotel at 2:30p, our room had still not been cleaned. I called to request housekeeping service after we left the room shortly thereafter; upon our return that evening, the service was sloppy: the bed was made, but the trash cans had been emptied and sort of thrown back into the room (rather than placed under the desk), toiletries had not been refreshed, a bag of food waste had not been removed, dirty glassware had not been replaced, etc. The pattern was similar the next day: we were given conditioner instead of lotion, etc. This poor attention-to-detail and incomplete service was surprising for a hotel of this price and brand. To management's credit, when I complained about the service, I did receive an appropriate response.While the hotel worked fine for a personal stay, had I traveled there for business, I would feel mixed. The lobby was small, with limited space to work or have conversations. At night, it was very loud, due to the lobby bar. The hotel does not have an executive lounge. Internet service was somewhat slow, although free.As a Hyatt Globalist, I was extended complimentary breakfast in the hotel's restaurant. Service here was excellent and the food satisfactory.Overall, an average stay. Given my experiences with the Hyatt brand, I expected a better experience than I had at this hotel. I would consider staying there again, but I also would not make it my first choice in NYC.","Chicago, Illinois",795,3.0

We have stayed in a number of hotels, ranging from five star to barely one. We thought we had found our sweet spot with the Hyatt Union Square. We love the location and our previous couple of times had been fine. This trip however things went down hill fast. First we checked in and asked for a quiet room, preferably the same room as we have been staying in previously, 801. Floors 9-11 were closed to guess for some reason. Instead of a quiet room the front desk decided to surround us with a bus load of teenage girls who proceeded to stay up all night moving from one room to another with the music blaring. This is why it was clear no guests were put on the upper three floors. It was more convenient to crowd every floor until it was full before opening up the next one. The next day after complaining to the front desk we went out from early morning, returning around 4:30pm only to find our room still not cleaned. We are frustrated as we have to wait in the lobby for 45 minutes only to discover the bed wasn't made, the room service trays and the trash was still in the room, after we were told the room was ready. Today we decided to be proactive let the front desk know that we would be out from 12-2 and could they please clean the room while were out. Came back, room hasn't been touched.

The bath robe in the room smelled heavily from sweat (not ours.. luckily we checked before using) and it seems that the soap you get better last for the entire time cause they don't seem to replace it when it's empty.

Plus if you are ok with using a subway, it’s amazingly convenient since you are just a few stops from basically the entire city. The only real negative that is very hard to ignore is the room service. If you like using room service , this is not the hotel for you. We just had a horrible time getting anything right or in a timely way or they just would ignore us. Don’t understand it since the staff at the front desk seemed very nice and efficient. And the housekeeping was perfectly fine. It was really surprising since the Hyatt product is usually fairly consistent but this was just so bad its hard to fathom why they would bother with having any room service at all. Perhaps having ice machines and a small snack shop would do it and at least no one would expect anything more than that and likely would satisfy the majority of guests.We still hand a wonderful time and again potentially would stay again since the location was so great and overall we had a good experience- we would just order in from Postmates or UberEats!

The TV's are large flat screen LG's although for those who do this, I could not play films from USB key on them and had to use a HDMI lead from my laptop.We never used the bar or ate breakfast. Breakfast is VERY expensive and there is a café right over the road from the hotel called Sandwicherie which does a very good breakfast for $6.After the first night of our 7 day stay we found the housekeeping of the room to be a little sloppy having missed to clean / replace cups and glasses but this was not repeated so can be forgiven. We didn't raise this as a complaint, it was a minor misdemeanour. On another slightly negative note, when requesting some plates and cutlery to eat some cheese we purchased from a local shop, we had to request this twice as it was not delivered in the first instance.Overall it was a good stay and the best part was the location...

But if my wife had been with me we would have been tripping over each other in the narrow space between bed and desk.Shower but no bath.WiFi is ""free"", but only for the slowest speed of service. This is a bugaboo of mine; I figure if you're paying a couple of hundred bucks for a room, they can throw in an internet connection. So I stubbornly selected the Free option, and it was fine. Even with multiple devices. As the price list helpfully explains, you'll need to pay if you want video streaming (Skype, Netflix), but regular email, internet and even Netflix downloads were problem-free.Calls to Guest Services are answered promptly, and follow-up is quick.There was no sign of a doorman when I arrived, which I assumed was part of the hotel's casual atmosphere. However every other time I went out or came back, there was someone to open the door or call a taxi.My biggest complaint about the hotel is that the walls are thin and the doors are heavy. I had the misfortune to be next to a couple loudly in love, and it sounded like we were sharing a bed. Door closings are equally noisy. Bring ear plugs.While there are plusher hotels in more famous locations -- several of which I've stayed at for years -- there's a good chance I'll be back at the Hyatt Union Square on my next visit.

The restaurant had just opened and they had some major issues there but again, they staff made it right. No hotel will be perfect, and the extra attention to doing the right thing makes all the difference when you're looking at different hotel options. The location central, and easy to get to a train that will take you just about anywhere in the city. The room was a decent size for NYC. The shower was great.

Perfect spot for exploring the east village - don't miss Verameat for unique jewelry, Cloak and Dagger across the road for cute clothes and Oiji for a fabulous meal. Nearby Union Square market is fun as is a stroll up Broadway to Fishes Eddy, ABC Kitchen ( not food), Marimekko and their beautiful Dutch designs and then a lunch outside at Madison Square Park. Don't forget a stop at Eataly. The Hyatt was a solid base for our return to NYC - we lived here for a few years and did not want to stay in a tourist area - Hyatt is a great choice for this. Bowery Road restaurant in the hotel is a great place to grab lunch or dinner without spending too much money and it is a solid meal. Try the skirt steak and tomatoes if you a doing the carb free thing, yum. We could not get over how quiet the street was for sleeping. It can be noisy at night in the city ( you get use to it) but I never heard a thing and slept well. Bathroom had plenty of space, could use a make up mirror and the room for New York was a good size. Union Square is at the 14th street subway station which is a transfer station meaning you can get anywhere in the city. Use the subway it's easy and best way to see the city.

So comfy, I wore it around my room whilst doing email and meetings. L O V E. Besides that -it's a great location for the Union Square/Flat Iron/Shopping area. Very close (shares the same big city block) with The Strand (18 miles of book shelves people) one of the oldest and certainly largest bookstores in Manhattan. Great restaurants all around as well. Tried the in room dining (Salmon and Roasted Cauliflower dish) my first night. yum. It's more boutique like than some of the other NYC Hyatthotels I've stayed at but nice. The fitness area is decent size with multiple machines for cardio and a full weight/stretching area as well. Product in shower are great. Towels are great. My one and only beef would be the walls to the hallway are THIN you can hear every door open and close near by as if they were coming into your room.

Yes, it is in Union Square, but there are so many better hotels in the city for this money, despite this being a good location. First, a valet comes to help with your luggage, but does not even introduce himself as a Hyatt employee or have a uniform on, so you just think someone is taking your luggage. Then upon check in they announce loudly how you are paying for the room - don't need the world to know how much I paid, or if I used points. Then you discover the rooms are tiny with only two usable drawers and only enough space to hang your trousers if you remove a lot of stuff from the tiny closet like the ironing board. Then don't try to get your laundry done - they returned mine undone with no note to say why it wasn't done and I had a wedding to go to a wedding the next morning. When I tried to talk to front desk, they had no explanation. When I tried to escalate to a manager they said none was on duty. When I asked for prompt return of my call, no one called after 20 min and I had to call back. How sad. Never coming here again. Do not recommend. ","Boston, Massachusetts",10,2.0

Upon arrival with another executive, we were told that at 11:45 PM (the bar was already closed). That was disappointing but but tolerable. We braved the cold night and found drinks and food elsewhere. Upon entering my room, I was surprised at how SMALL the room is. My bathroom at home is bigger. Since, I am only staying for 3 nights -- I figured no big deal. Linens and pillows had the distinct smell of OLD, SWEATY BODY ODOR, so much so that I had to spray perfume on them nightly and sleep on one of my clean shirts so as to not have to smell or have my face touch the pillow directly. Even that, I tolerated b/c as a seasoned traveler I have learned that if a hotel has smelly linens in the room -- the ones they will replace won't be much better. All these small things don't amount to much individually but all together is annoying and irritating BUT STILL I tolerated it and did not say anything to hotel staff. HOWEVER, if there should be one redeeming factor let it be the hotel staff service and room service. And there too hotel staff failed miserably. After a very long day, I ordered a $16 burger (after service fee, tip etc. total was more like $32 -- seriously.) only to have it come ALL wrong. After advising hotel staff they told me they were ""willing"" to comp me a new burger. Shouldn't they be apologetic and I be the one ""willing"" to accept it? When I asked if they could duplicate my order and asked her to read it back to me (it must have been initially written down, right?) I was put on eternal hold. I went out crossed the street and bought a burrito faster than they were able to figure out if they wrote it down or not, still don't know -- pretty sure not) Room service shouldn't be this hard, listen and write it down. Also don't tell me you are ""willing"" to do anything after you have messed up. Apologize profusely and ask if I'd be willing to accept the comped meal (I wouldn't have anyway).

Situated a block from the Union Square Subway, you can go to all the important places in the city without switching trains. We were in Battery Park (Statue of Liberty) and the Freedom Tower in minutes. Another stop was close to Central Park and the Broadway area. Forget the subway as several wonderful areas are within walking distance of the hotel. This was truly an ideal location for me. Stay in Times Square if you must but I was so happy to be far away from it.Check-in was fantastic and Kenza was a delight throughout the trip. She was friendly, enthusiastic, and had some great food recommendations. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and accommodating. We stayed in an ADA accessible room which overlooked the street. I believe this was an upgrade over the courtyard view I booked. It was spacious and the ADA accessible items were not intrusive with the exception of the shower which resulted in a wet floor everytime someone took a shower. The room is thoroughly modern, stylish, upscale, comfortable, and had awesome touches such as a Bluetooth enabled clock and plenty of plugs in the room. My only complaints were the lack of a fridge (which could have fit in the room) along with a vanity mirror with a broken light (it was hard to see in the mirrors). Otherwise, I loved the room! There were some elevator issues in the hotel a couple of times but they were not overly annoying.I would be sad if I didn't stay here on my next trip to New York. If you want to be near the cool stuff, stay here and enjoy yourself!","San Diego, California",174,5.0

The front desk staff were nice and professional. They assigned us a high floor view room which I appreciated. Then we discovered the facilities/maintenance manager is doing such a POOOOOOR job. The first room had a bathroom ceiling that vibrated so loud from the HVAC unit. It was like being near a helicopter and was louder than any super 8 hotel! I could have never slept! We asked to move rooms and were told someone would come up to help us move. A guy came by, fairly quickly, and gave me a key yet had no luggage cart and clearly didn't want to help us. We managed.We moved to the 2nd room, which had a terrace. Nice! Yet the terrace door didn't lock- the lock wouldn't turn. That gives our neighbors fairly easy access to my room. The HVAC unit in this room was loud too, even though nothing like the 1st room. We slept in a cold room the 1st night due to the noise, and I actually heard the unit in the room next door. It got worse: The toilet was in its own room which flooded from the shower above us. It was easy to see the water damage in the ceiling and down the wet walls. Also the sink barely drained leaving a pool of yuk. I used the business center which turned out to be a single computer w/no chair in an employee hallway. It was uncomfortable and freezing (winter) being near a service corridor w/the door opened exposing trash and related.The TV worked when pulled away from the wall yet often lost signal when it was pushed back in- bad connections. Finally the billfold with a writing pad had no paper in it so why bother to have one?I've stayed in a A LOT of Hyatt hotels over the past 30 years.

The hotel was in a great location, was well decorated, had courteous staff and had everything you would want from such a hotel. I would have given this hotel a 5 rating until we checked out. That said, I must tell you to be VERY aware of their billing tactics. We had reserved one room with two queen beds but upon checking in, the front desk person informed us they no longer had a room with two queen beds available but, ""for the same price, we will give you two king rooms that adjoin."" I thought, ""PERFECT."" We enjoyed our stay and after check out I realized they charged us for both rooms (my mom checked us out and didn't thoroughly review the bill. Admittedly, she is not a seasoned traveler so she trusted their billing, signed the bill and left). Once I realized the mistake (four hours later), I called and asked them to remove one room as that was not the agreed upon plan. They said, ""no problem! It is all taken care of."" So I followed up by asking how much we owed. The price they gave me took a couple hundred bucks off the bill. Ummm, no...I need a whole room charge removed, not less than half a night. So, had I not asked, they would have gotten away with charging me more...again. They tried to pass it off by saying, ""we only agreed to giving you the same rate for one night."" I said, ""WHAT?!??"" I can assure you, that was NOT the case. I responded that I was only going to pay for one room. They proceeded to do some interesting math and started using industry phrases that I am sure they were using to try and confuse me and told me I owed more than the one room total. I am not sure how that even made sense considering I had two bills, one for the first room, and one for the second. It a seems to me, I should only pay for one of those rooms. At one point they said, ""that room charge was a mistake on our part, we should have charged you more."" CHARGED US MORE?!?? You charged me for two rooms when you told me you would only charge me for one and almost got away with it, and then tried to charge me more AGAIN and hang up the phone before I could question it. I finally gave in and agreed to pay the higher price for the one room (I was at the airport dealing with a flight cancellation and was about to be helped after waiting a long time in line to speak with an airline customer service agent...I had no choice but to give in) and THEN the manager started to add our ""incidentals,"" on from the other room which were a few food items and drinks from the mini bar. I stopped him and asked him why after messing up our bill and me finally agreeing to pay the higher price for the one room (and losing 30 minutes of my life dealing with this situation) that he would even bother. The manager Stephen did agree to remove the mini bar charges. That was the only positive that came out of our conversation, but let's not forget they still got more money out of me than they should have and would have gotten a lot more had I not reviewed the bill or followed up with their first, ""all taken care of."" So, stay here for a good and reliable branded hotel with a good location, but be aware that they will take advantage of you and use any tactic they can to charge you extra. I should add, one elevator was broken so it took us about 20 minutes to get up or down every time we needed it. That was quite annoying but not a deal breaker. Their tactics and willingness to over bill you were most alarming and, to me, a deal breaker.",Shanghai,15,2.0

I landed on the Hyatt at Union Square because of its relative affordability and its ideal location. Most of the hotels in Manhattan carry a high price tag, but where the Hyatt excels is its ability to provide a comfortable and hassle free stay for less than the price of other surrounding hotels.We arrived in NYC early morning and to our surprise, the hotel was able to check us in at 9am, which greatly improved our weekend vacation. Upon arrival, check in was easy and the front desk made sure to provide anything that we requested. Union Square proved to be a great place to stay in because of it's central location in Manhattan, which made it easy to get to any corner of the city, whether by walking, subway, or taxi (or in our case, Uber). The room was small but made up for its size with the amenities it provided and the large bathroom and shower.The service at the hotel was 5-star, except for one small hiccup I had concerning the complimentary shoe shine service, wherein employee never showed up to polish my shoes at my request. Other than that, our entire stay was smooth, comfortable and genuinely pleasant.If you would like to stay in Manhattan for a decent price while not having to compromise on creature comforts, the Hyatt at Union Square will meet your needs and leave you satisfied.","Cabazon, California",0,4.0

I started staying there because it was the closest to my office, but after trying out other nearby hotels, I find myself returning time after time to the Hyatt. My favorite things: good balance in the lobby (easy to hang out and wait if needed, but not overdone or too large to navigate), fast elevators, super comfy beds, AMAZING blackout curtains (I've overslept more times than I can count - I now rely on the wake up calls!), a decent selection of snacks in the room, good room service (the homemade donuts are the best), good restaurant/bar right in the hotel, and very helpful staff. All of these make for a generally great experience every time I have stayed here. Just a few things could use improvement: I was initially booking through a 3rd party website and so even though I was staying at least a few times per month, the front desk staff wouldn't recognize me and would give me the entire new guest spiel each time. At one point I think I even said, ""Seriously? I was here last week."" to the person at the check in counter who asked if I had stayed with them before. She had checked me in at least 2-3 times prior. If I'm staying this often at your hotel, I'd like to think you'd treat me like I'm coming home to somewhere familiar, even if booking through a 3rd party. Perhaps it's a technique to convince frequent guests to use their proprietary rewards system? Also, many rooms (mostly the courtyard-facing ones) don't have a minibar fridge, which is frustrating when you'd like a cold drink without ordering room service or heading outside. Finally, every single time I stay, I request foam pillows instead of the feather ones. You'd think that the front desk would note this and have them automatically placed in my room upon my arrival. Just a few improvements would make this hotel spectacular, and I would be extremely hard to convince to stay anywhere else in the City!","Rochester, New Hampshire",0,5.0

First three nights were for business, the next five were for 'pleasure'. The business portion of the stay was great. I was given a room without a refrigerator and was provided one quickly when I requested one. I needed additional hangers and those too were provided without issue. Hyatt provides in room coffee and I was provided two packages of regular coffee each day. All was good. Then came the personal part of my stay. One night I was awoken in the wee hours of the morning by what sounded like a dog scratching on the door and a VERY STRONG smell of lacquer. When leaving my room the next day, I could tell that the baseboards in the hallway had been worked on and also had appeared to have been painted. In the middle of the night, really? On the second day of my personal stay, we were provided no regular coffee, when we called to inquire we were told that they had run out but that coffee would be provided in the lobby the next morning from 5 am to 7 or 8 am I believe. When we went to the lobby for coffee, we were told that wasn't offered on the weekends. We then had no option but to buy from their restaurant or go to a local coffee shop. Before heading back to our room that evening we checked on the coffee. We were told they only had decaf. For the remainder of our stay the regular coffee was not replenished. How does an organization as large as Hyatt run out of regular coffee? Another day we returned to our room in the early evening after a day of sightseeing to find our room had not been made up. Another day we were provided no hand towels. On our final day we attempted to use the computer in their lobby to print our boarding passes only to find out the computer had a software issue and we couldn't access the airline's site. I can't complain about the front desk staff as they were all friendly, helpful, professional and courteous. But I'm perplexed as to what happened halfway through our stay.

Toiletries were never replaced despite being completely empty.2. Inconsistent service with several employees seeming completely confused by hotel systems3. Hotel did not honor Diamond upgrade privileges 4. Disappointing and over priced restaurant Pros:1. Close proximity to union square2. New property Detailed Review: As a diamond member and frequent traveler I was excited to try this property. I typically stay at the Park Hyatt (which is amazing) or one of the many great boutique hotels in NYC. However, I was met with disappointment after disappointment. When I checked in I was notified that there was an upgrade available but that they may have to move me later during my stay. I graciously accepted the upgrade and was promptly relocated the next day. However, when checking online the room type I was upgraded to still available. When I asked about why I was moved when the room type was still available I was met with a blank stare followed by ""You are right, I don't know why the moved you. But they moved you already so I can't do anything now."" The Diamond benefits letter was delivered the following day since nothing was explained at check in. The Diamond breakfast benefit is a $25 credit at the restaurant in the lobby. The service in the restaurant is good, but the food is just alright and over priced (i.e. a side of mixed berries is $14). The rooms are well appointed but have awkward built ins on the walls that take up quite a bit of space while providing no tangible benefit. ",,1,2.0

This property considers their corner room a suite - I think they call it the Alcove loft, which is a huge joke, so when you use your diamond suite upgrades this is what you are going to be getting. I cannot imagine what a basic room is going to be like.2. They don't have a proper breakfast buffet, which poses a problem especially if you are a diamond member. Although they did attempt to fix the problem by crediting me fully, I still think that they should fix their breakfast offerings instead. Have a different menu for diamond members. They were offering a $25 per person credit which is a joke if you look at their prices. When I have breakfast included, I expect a buffet, if you do not have a buffet like at some Park Hyatt properties then I expect to be able to order whatever I like on the ala carte menu. I am not an unreasonable person, for 2 people this is what we ordered to share: minute steak with eggs, french toast, juice and one other item most likely. So we basically had a bit of meat, eggs, carbs/pastry with the french toast... and juice which is what you would typically get in a buffet. And this with tip comes up to a whopping 80-100 bucks. I had breakfast there, 2 or 3 times and that was what the bill was, the hotel wanted to cover something like $60-$70 bucks I was adamant that my order would constitute what a normal breakfast would be. And that should not be $80-$100. I just hate having to haggle. 3. If you have matte tile floors in the toilet that needs special care and be wet mopped, that did not happen during my stay. Bear in mind that whenever I ask for my room to be cleaned I tip the usual $5. So I expect my room to be cleaned properly.Overall the experience was ok, it was not horrible but it was surely average. The room was tiny even after the upgrade. If I was going to be paying $300-$400 for the room I would surely be staying some where else. Also this hotel has little to no facilities. I must say the servers at their breakfast place was above average.","Toronto, Canada",33,3.0

The room was a good size for New York and the terrace was excellent if a little bit noisy as it's so close to the street with plenty of sun in the morning (second floor, 4th avenue side). Decor is nice and modern and the bed was very comfortable. Most importantly, the room was clean and in a good condition. The only thing that was slightly lacking in the room was storage, I prefer a tidy room with suitcases and shoes out of sight but the wardrobe space was very small with only just enough room for the clothes of two people (even though we stayed a week I wouldn't say we had an excessive amount of clothing with us!). The only slightly negative comment I have is that the ""business center"" is a bit basic - more like a standing-only computer station and I have frankly seen better in Holiday Inn and Four Point hotels which are somewhat cheaper. All staff were really friendly and helpful and I would definitely stay again if I was visiting the same area.","London, United Kingdom",3,5.0

I have had a great experience each time. The hotel is in a modern style, with friendly and helpful staff. I stayed in an Alcove Loft, which is roomy (for New York) corner room, light and airy and has great views out of windows on two sides. It has a little sitting area, a desk, 2 TVs and and very comfortable bed. In terms of amenities, the hotel has a very nice gym, beautiful roof deck (which they don't promote--I'm not sure why because it is great on a summer evening), a nice bar and good restaurant next door. The one bad experience I had was getting stuck in the elevator but someone answered the call button right away and I was out of there in about 10 minutes. Last but not least, the last time I was there I forgot some clothes and they located them and shipped them right to me. Kudos to the honesty and responsiveness of the housekeeping staff!

When we first got to New York, we were exhausted so we wanted to lay down. However our room was not ready until 2:30. This was three hours after we arrived and 30 minutes after check-in time. By that time, they should have made that night free. And for half of our 7 day trip, one of the two elevators was not working so it took 10 minutes to catch one. This was a pain and completely inconvenient. Also, the room was TINY!! There was nowhere to put our luggage because the beds did not have space underneath them. Then once we had unpacked there was barely any closet or drawer space to put our clothes. Now mind you it was me and my mother (two women) so we brought A LOT of clothes especially since we were staying there for 7 nights!Oh and another thing was the fact that you could hear someone talking in the lobby all the way up to the 10th floor.

Reasonably close to Union Square subway stop, unsure of taxi frequency as I never took one. The Union Square Wines shop across the street is pretty good. Wines in the hotel room were just okay but the prices were reasonable. They need to provide some kind of refrigeration for the white wines, though (I understand some rooms have a fridge, mine did not.) Workout room was sufficient and well stocked with necessities. The Fourth cafe/restaurant has a good menu and good service but closes the bar too early. No pool or hot tub is a big downer for me - enough to have me looking for another hotel next time, but not absolutely a show-stopper. Room noise (from inside the hotel) was more than I expected, but not keeping me up at night. Sirens and honking are just NYC but outside noise never kept me awake or woke me. Nice décor, bed was pretty comfortable. Pillows were good. Shower was cool but a bit impractical because it wets most of the bathroom floor. I'd stay there again, but only after ruling out other options.","Seattle, United States",1,4.0

I am a Diamond member and often stay in midtown, and all Hyatts have been very good, but this one is in a different class as it's much more of an Andaz feel, and every interaction I had was surprisingly excellent. From the maids, to the front desk, to the guys who took shoes for complimentary shines, every employee either loves working here, or they have been incredibly well trained. I upgraded to an Alcove Suite, which was a superb suite. The bed was excellent, the shower outstanding, and the layout was very cool as I had multiple street views. Great Nespresso in the room (dangerous for them as they give you small cups, so if you pick the wrong size it could overflow). Very good closet design, safe; excellent, clean work out facility, very cool lobby, even nice elevators. Staff was uniformly superb. My only complaint would be that Diamonds, who usually get free breakfasts, were given a $25 credit instead, and you know what that buys you in NYC...A fantastic hotel, located in a great area with access to subways that take you pretty much anywhere. Several great restaurants are within 5-10 minute walk, and I found more good pizza around Union Square than I ever could in midtown. Highest recommendation....","Marietta, Georgia",12,5.0

It is essentially a King-sized bed, narrow desk, small closet and not much room for much else. That said, it is clean, tastefully decorated, and the bed was standard Hyatt (although not Westin!) comfortable.

The hotel put us in the wrong room the first night, they actually downgraded us, we bought this to their attention 3 times before being moved and weren't offered a refund, instead told breakfast would be complimentary at the restaurant attached to the lobby, we also had included in our booking free breakfast for 1 person, on checkout there was no record of the complimentary breakfast and they tried to charge the full amount for 2 breakfasts each morning, highly annoying.

This one did not disappoint. The staff was universally friendly and and overall helpful. There was a bit of a 'failure to communicate' between the management and some of the staff a couple of times (for example, bringing me an electric kettle that had a foreign plug? why would they even have that? I just wanted to make hot water, and i hadn't yet discovered the actual coffee maker hidden in the furniture), but it was all worked out and absolutely no 'attitude'--- other than a good one. The rooms appear to have been redone recently---clean, modern, and I love the Euro-trend to wood floors (as opposed to grungy carpet). Someone thought about what one needs to do in a hotel room--eg, where/how you need to control the lights. Not so sure about the trend to having a bathroom sort of in the middle of the room as opposed to a room itself, but the shower made up for everything. i don't usually get excited about hotel showers but i LOVED this one. Big, with great tile (just pleasant to be in). Well-placed shower head, with just the right flow and pressure. And a little foot shelf! I didn't want to get out. A great bed. Windows that open --- my favorite for controlling the climate, which is never well done by a hotel thermostat. The construction was sustainable and eco-friendly (a bonus when you can find it).

You definitely don't want to sound unreasonable or idiotic...With that said, here are the problems I had with this hotel1) The Noise. I had what was described as a ""quiet"" room on the reservation slip. However, it was anything but. Where your mileage may vary is the appreciation of the AC/Heater blower which I found incredibly noisy so turned it off. Once you turn that off you realize that it covered the noise of the pipes, I woke up to the sound of people taking a shower, flushing etc. I am happy to accept that maybe I am too noise sensitive on that point.Where it's not really up to debate is the paper thin walls and the severe lack of luck we had with our neighbors. Day 1: Teenagers on the phone and laughing all the time. Day #2 party people coming home yelling in the corridor at 330am and then 530m. Day #3: a dog yapping...So yes, not ""quiet"" by any stretch of the imagination. Had to go buy earplugs.2) Service is not great. Reactions ranged to the very nice ""we never had any complaints"" to the better yet equally uneffective ""even if i could switch you to another room it would be street view and even noisier"". In addition -I guess it's the New York style- but, while you walk in front (like less than one meter) from the desk every time you go in and out the hotel, you don't get a hello 50% of the time... (I thought us Parisians were supposed to be bad...)3) The corridors don't get vaccuumed, at least for the 5 days we were there. This piece of plastic in front of my room greeted us day 1 and stayed until the end. Also, Room cleaning was just skipped one day and when we asked around 4pm to do it, it was done very poorly.What is good about this hotel is location: Union Square is a great place to use a base for NYC. Also, the rooms is quite nice, the internet works well, the bed comfortable and the amenities Hyatt level.

It is a virtually new Hotel in a pleasant and relatively quiet part of town; off the tourist trail and nicer to stroll around than Mid-town but with the trendy Union Square round the corner and excellent transport connections for all parts of the City.Positives were:-As a new hotel, nearly everything was fresh, clean and working (apart from the sink drain!)The staff are unusually friendly, welcoming and with more time for you than anywhere I have experienced in New York before.The design is interesting and innovative to maximise the spacious feel of a quite small building with quite small rooms.For a ""boutique"" hotel, the range of food and drink outlets is excellent with three bars and two restaurants each with a contrasting vibe. Something for everyone there. The negatives: The small rooms were given a more spacious feel by the clever expedient of removing the walls of the bathroom so that is was an integral part of the room. Clever design but not to our taste. Although there was room for an easy chair or two, the only piece of furniture apart from the (very comfortable) bed were a fitted work desk and a desk chair. Fine for a business person stopping overnight but not for leisure visitors staying a number of days.The food and drink prices were so high that we felt compelled to look for cheaper options elsewhere, which we don't usually do.

I felt disrespected, wanted to bail out, go somewhere else; however, since the business meetings were already scheduled, I stayed but wasn’t a happy guest. I would disagree with the hotel’s claim of being a “Modern Luxury Hotel.” Modern it is, luxury it is not (although it does sport THE best blackout drapes ever!). Leaving the elevator on your room floor you encounter a decidedly narrow institutional hallway. Where’s the luxury? The walls are thin – all night long I heard doors opening and closing. Oh, yes, and by the way, I got stuck in the elevator between floors. Not a single button could make the thing go. Talk about scary. I finally pushed the “help” button and a distant voice asked me what the problem was; in what seemed like ages (could have been minutes given my state of mind), the car was moving again. After talking to the manager, I received a meaningful accommodation for which I am appreciative. The shower was great but the shower stall was not well ventilated so even new it has started to smell moldy. The room is “overdesigned hip” and seems to be furnished from Ikea. C’mon, at these prices... OK, the good: great location, lots of small eateries in the neighborhood, Union Square a block away, the Strand bookstore around the corner.

Nice selection of newspapers.The BAD parts were not really a surprise as most of it had been extensively described in prior reviews ( very poor design of the shower and bathroom, very "" hard"" feeling mattresses, complicated light switches, no mini fridge, dark elevators, ..). The strange thing here is: the mattress looks expensive, has a nice soft pad on top of it, and nevertheless...feels (sometimes) horrible to sleep on, although I was told that other customers feel it is too soft, or just right.Overall: a great hotel, just be careful how you sleep (protect your back), be careful when you shower ( or water will spill all over), and become really proficient at handling the tricky light switches ( unless you want to wake up your partner in the middle of the night if you have to get up). Luckily none of these might be that big a deal for most people.I still would recommend a stay in this hotel. Do not miss their cappuccino and croissants in the morning.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",4,4.0

The linens, furnishings, bed and so forth were all to a very high standard. The housekeeping service was good (and when they made a mistake with an order we were given a nice gift to compensate) We also ate in the hotel on quite a few occcasions, both from In Room Dining (good) and The Fourth Restaurant (Very Good). Of course the downside of Union Sq (and the nearby fire station) is that it is darn noisy, especially on Hallowe'en, but hey that particular 'festival' is always noisy! The hotel is well located for shops, cafes, restaurants and all sorts of facilities, all within a walk. And the subway is very close too. On most mornings we bought breakfast in a local deli and brought it back to our room, and that was good and economical too. Union Square itself is a busy place, with (dare I say it) a 'hippy' rather than 'hipster' vibe, but it is good to look around the Square itself, if only to see that side of NYC upclose. The Square also has a huge Barnes & Noble bookstore; reason enough to stay nearby, not to mention the iconic Strand Books, also close.

We had our small dog with us as well. This was a last-minute reservation, and I needed to vacate the apartment with the dog around 9 am, so I called the hotel to ask about early check in. They were friendly and accommodating, and they gave me a lower neighborhood rate as well, very nice! In the end I was able to check in at 11 am. Without the dog I could have checked in when I first arrived around 9:30 am, but apparently dogs are only allowed on the two lowest floors of the hotel. The only glitch was that I'd paid for the second-lowest room category, with a street view, and initially they put me into a courtyard view room, the lowest category. I called as soon as I saw the dark courtyard view and they put me in a different room immediately, a much brighter and slightly larger room with a view out to Fourth Avenue.The room overall was still quite small - and the bathroom even smaller - but it was modern, clean, and functional. Not a luxury hotel but nice enough. I found there was a fair bit of noise coming in from the hallway, even though we were at the end of the hall. Any time someone spoke in the hall, you heard them loud and clear. I didn't have a problem with street noise, however.What really made this hotel 4 stars for me was the staff.

We wanted to try the Hyatt because we heard good things about it. The costs were high but we figured it would be worth it because of the location and the great ratings. When we landed my friend learned that her dog passed away and was very upset. On check-in, we knew the room was not likely ready as it was about noon. The staff was helpful and courteous so they gave us a room that was available so my friend could freshen up. The room's layout was problematic for us. The room was extremely small and although the toilet had a door, the shower and sink area did not. There was absolutely no privacy. When we asked to switch rooms we were told all of their rooms were designed that way as it is a ""boutique"" hotel and that they were fully committed for the entire weekend. They also advised that it would be an upgrade to relocate to a room with a door to the bathroom! After continuing to complain they agreed the next day to upgrade us to a room with a door to the bathroom. The next night the room was fine - exactly the same with a door to the bathroom. The problem was we were put all day and when returning in the evening it was freezing in the room because the thermostat was broken. We just turned the air off and went to bed. I would not recommend this hotel because nobody explained to us when booking that you would have to pay more money for a room that had a door to the bathroom. We were already paying over $500 for the room! I also did not appreciate how management handled the situation.

The location is good if you want to be in the middle of the east and west village. Lots of places you can walk too. However, it is a bit noisy being so close to Union Square and there is also a fire station very close. We were on the 10th floor and heard sirens all the time. I had to use ear plugs to sleep. I had booked a courtyard side room to try to get away from that, but they put us facing 4th. I'm sure this was considered an upgrade for a better view, but the noise was pretty bad. The rooms are small, even for NYC, but nice. It is a bit different to have your vanity and shower in your room without a door. Personal preference on if that would bother you or not. The toiletries given are much nicer than many hotels we've been too. Like I said, small but usable and updated.They also seemed to be having elevator issues while we were there. We got stuck in an elevator. Not a great experience. And the next day they were working on the elevators again. I will say that one of the staff members took some money off our total bill because of the incident. The staff was very attentive the entire time we were there. Always welcoming you back and offering assistance. We are not sure how to rate this hotel. Sirens are a part of NYC and Hyatt can't do anything about that. But maybe honor a request for a courtyard room. Elevators have issues, it happens. Just not fun when it happens to you. So, will we stay here again? We are undecided. The noise level, while probably less than say Times Sq, is still more than we are used to from other hotels in the city. But the rooms and staff were nice. The cost was a bit more than I think that hotel should be, but it is NYC. Nothing over the top, but a nice hotel with a good location. I think it all depends on where you want to be and what you are looking for.",michigan,33,3.0

I could not believe how much money it was going to cost but thought it would be a great location and high end hotel. This is unfortunately a hotel run by young people for young people. Very little service. Decent small room but a disappointment. A couple specific things that went wrong and for which the hotel never apologized were 1)on day of check in, they said they'd call me when my room was ready as I arrived earlier than the scheduled check in time. They said a room would be available soon. I never received a call. 2)one day I came back to my room at 5 PM and the room had not been made up. I asked housekeeping and asked the front desk as well; both were very casual and nonchalant about getting this done; 3)it felt like a college dorm with people talking out in the hallways way into the early morning hours.

My room temperature was set at 74 degrees when I arrived, which was enough for me to continue sweating until I noticed the thermostat. The water dispenser in the foyer is a nice touch, but it was left empty for most of the night.

None of the pleasant front-of-house staff seems to be over 30, and they worked hard towards making sure our stay was a comfortable one, and our requests were met with quickly and cheerfully, and with no hassle by any of the staff re our asking for an extended check-out time, for example. Our quiet room was located on a 5th floor corner overlooking 4th Avenue, and was bright, clean and functionally contemporary. The only design changes I would like to see would be for a larger refrigerator, a less shallow bathroom sink (it was only a few inches deep), and a gentler outer door that didn't inevitably bang shut noisily. Perhaps the highlight of the room was the extremely comfortable double bed, which made getting up in the mornings such a chore. The front desk in the lobby was as minimalist as I have ever seen in a hotel, which worked fine, but overall the lobby could have done with improved lighting, gentler music, and some more amenities like the sale of postcards and maps. Getting about the city from Union Square couldn't have been simpler, with the Subway just a few hundred yards away and a variety of passing and nearby city buses moving in all directions; and Greenwich Village was within easy walking distance. For book-lovers, the great delight in this New York University neighbourhood would also be the existence of the superb and venerable Strand Books store barely one block away.

Our daughter was moving into an apartment in NYC, so we chose the Hyatt, Union Square, expecting a stress free stay. Unfortunately there are so many problems with the hotel; I don’t know where to begin.We arrived on Thursday, August 13th. The sink and toilet in our room were both extremely slow.. The toilet had to always be flushed twice. The coffee maker was broken when we tried to use it in the the morning. During the evening, the air conditioner started making all sorts of unusual loud noises and grunts and we were unable to sleep the entire night. The next morning we packed up and asked for a quiet room with a functioning sink, toilet and air conditioner. We were first taken to a room next to the elevator, an absolute no for us. We were then given a second room . As soon as we entered the room and turned on the air we recognized that the air conditioning was completely broken. The front desk absolutely refused to move us again, saying that they would send up an engineer. We were told some sort of story about the temperature in NY. However we ARE intelligent enough to know when some thing is BROKEN….having nothing to do with the temperature in NY. It was beyond humiliating for us not to be believed …..to have to just sit there and endure an un air-conditioned room in the middle of a NY summer waiting to see if it can be fixed. The engineer spent 45 minutes attempting to fix the system before he gave up. We asked to be moved again. The front desk was very slow and it took another 45 minutes of sitting in this non air conditioned room to provide us with, yet, another room. Finally we were given a handicapped room. This entire move to another room took an ENTIRE MORNING, eating up our time needed to help our daughter.  The shower and the toilet were both in the shower. (handicapped room)Any time you showered the entire bathroom floor was wet for an hour. Shoes and pants became wet any time you needed to use the toilet after someone showered Nonetheless we kept that room out of desperation. Our coffee and toiletries were never replaced by the maid even once, though we complained to the front desk. Our key cards was cancelled twice after we extended our2 day stay to a third and then to a fourth. requiring us to go back down to the lobby and wait on line two separate times by the front desk for new cards. The front desk was often busy and we were unable to call for our car when needed. The phone would simply ring with no one answering it. Instead we had to go downstairs and wait 20 minutes instead of pre ordering. Finally, to add insult to injury, at 8:15 in the morning on Monday, August 17, someone used their key and simply WALKED INTO OUR ROOM…..no knocking. I screamed and the person left. We assumed it was a hotel employee. I reported it and barely received an apology. We never did find out who was responsible. This really alarmed us. It was completely unacceptable.It was a busy time moving our daughter into an apartment in NYC. We did not need the added stress of a less than mediocre hotel. The stay was awful and I would have to rate it POOR. The hotel did take off one night from the bill. However, this in no way compensated for the distress we endured.We look forward to your reply.And this was our reply. Please notice the FOUR spelling errors in the reply from the Hyatt. Very unprofessional.""Thank you so much for your email message regarding your stay at Hyatt Union Suqare ; it is my pleasure to assist you.I would like ot say I apologize on behalf of Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, for the stay in which you have described.

The staff seemed very happy to assist in anyway possible.We felt special. Only a few rooms per floor. Very private feel. Our room was very clean, quiet and comfortable. I dislike street noise, so I was relieved to have a room on the 10th floor facing away from the street. We had a unique view of an old wooden water tower and old fire escapes. Hard wood flooring was fantastic. Lavish linens. We did not feel like we were in a small room. Besides, we spent most of our days wandering about. We were able to get discount Broadway tickets (TKTS) for evening fun.The fitness room was a great way to start the day. So easy to walk or take the subway (train).

Not much light comes into the room so I wanted to change the room.As Diamond member I get normally an upgrade and I asked for it. They told me I will get the next day. Asking the next day, they told my again nothing is free but the next day. Normally if you stay in a Hyatt the staff is approaching you telling you that now they have a free room. But there nobody approaches you. So I asked again the next night – they said they forgot inform me - finally I got a different room which was then very nice, big windows, nice view therefore positive although indeed not so quiet – but better you hear traffic than you stay in a dark room (furniture are also dark, which looks nice if there is a lot of light in the room, but not nice if not much light comes from the window). True is also what other wrote – you hear almost everything through the doors if sbd is outside. As I had a free weekend I wanted to rent a bike on Saturday as it is promoted on their Homepage. Unfortunately it turned out that they have only two bikes available – first come – first serve. So there was no bike available on Saturday. Therefore on Sunday I went up early – bike was still available and I made a tour. After about 100 meters I realized that the chain protection – was half broken. So I had to improvise but then it worked nice. Coming back I informed the reception, they said they will repair it – so only one bike was available for the others the rest of the day. The next day I saw that they just had taken off the chain protection. I was just wondering whether a 5star hotel where you pay on average 430 USD per night cannot afford a third or fourth bike – taking into account that they promote the bikes actively? But as I found out later there are other ways. The public bikes to rent at the station for some dollars work quite well. The staff at the reception is young and there is quite a big number working there. I saw at least 7 during the week I stayed there. About 50% are friendly – with the other 50% you have the impression that they are more happy if you don´t ask them too much – not Hyatt standard and no comparison with the good and friendly team e.g. at Hyatt Times Square. Also it seems that staff is not interested that Hotel makes business. Before I arrived I asked via email for a special price for a longer stay. Several days no answer and once it came no real use of the answer. When I was there I asked the blond lady at the reception whether I could speak with sbd. from reservation or sales: Answer: No, as they are only hear from 9 a.m. to 5 a.m. (Remark: I arrived on a Friday at 3. p.m. asked already at that day whether I could speak with sbd. form reservations/sales but reception told me that everybody left already!!!). Then the lady asked me what it is about. I told her that I wanted to ask for a rate for November as I will stay here for 14 days. The lady answered: Just look in the internet (….which does not show you special rates).There are also some other small points which is not Hyatt standard: e.g.: I do not want that my room is cleaned every day. In each Hyatt in such a case you get a message through the door that room service could not clean because you had the “do not disturb” sign on. I assume this is done to see whether the customer is doing fine – which is proved when the guest takes the message. Well, this is not done at Hyatt Union Square. That are also a number of small things that normally make the difference of a Hyatt and a Sheraton – but which are not performed in Hyatt Union Square. Finally the absolute highlight of negative experience of my stay: As Diamond member I have breakfast free (in US as there is no buffet but a la carte until a certain amount). The first day I ate eggs sunny side up. It came with potatoes which is unusual for me. So the next day I asked for the eggs sunny side up but instead with potatoes I wanted to have bacon. To my surprise the waiter told me that he has to ask his superior. So he went to a lady, obviously his sperior, and I saw how she made an angry face and she shaked the face right and left. Waiter came back and told me that it is not possible but that I can order the bacon as side dish?! After I had breakfast I went to the superior of the waiter and told her that I never experienced in a five star hotel that I cannot change a side dish (even at Mc Donald’s you can tailor your hamburger if you wish). She told me that that´s the policy here. On my argument that the most policy is to be customer oriented she answered why I complain, I did eat the potatoes anyway. So I had enough went to the reception asked for the manager in charge. He apologized and told me that the Restaurant does not belong to the Hyatt there is only an agreement with them and they work that they come to Hyatt standard. Result: The next 5 days I did not go anymore for breakfast and I did not go to the restaurant anymore for dinner. Ok, here is what normally Hyatt Standard is: I stayed for business in Hyatt Madeleine Paris: I had problems with my stomach and asked the waitress whether I could have sth which is good for my stomach but not on the menu. The waitress told me that this is not problem and the next days I got clear vegetable soup, mashed potatoes etc. – they simply took care of me. That is why I choose Hyatt. When I asked in Paris whether I could talk with sales, reception informed their colleagues, they email and called me and we found a time where we could meet and since then I am always trying to go to this hotel with my team. All this is missing at Hyatt Union Square although it is not really a bargain to stay there. Last remark: I asked today for a rate for my 14 days stay at the hotel and I got an answer the same day. So hopefully things are getting better.",Wiener Neustadt,6,3.0

We figured Hyatt would be a special experience, but we were disappointed. The good: rooms are artfully appointed, very clean, and well maintained. Very trendy decor. The bad: NYC tiny, plus the bathroom was literally in the bedroom with only a mirror separating the two. Also, the shower handle came off in my hand when I turned it to set temperature, and the cold faucet turned in the wrong direction over the basin. The good: nice turndown service includes clean towels and fancy chocolate. staff were cheerful and polite and full of offers to help. The bad:they didn't deliver. I'd ordered a refrigerator in advance for medical reasons, and we called that evening from the taxi. The clerk said she would look for one. When we got there, she said she couldn't find one but there would be one around noon the next day. We figured someone would be checking out from another room and we could get that fridge. Fortunately I had ice to get me through the night. But in the morning they confessed that they didn't really have ANY refrigerators and would try to get one from another hotel. I took my medication and ice packs to our hosts' home-a bit inconvenient but safe. The hotel offered to store my medication in their fridge (after the inaccurate communications was hardly going to trust them with expensive medication that I needed to stay alive), but they had no freezer for the ice packs. Finally that afternoon they called to say they had a fridge, and all was well. I appreciate that Someone went out of the way to get that fridge. But this is the first time I've ever had trouble getting a fridge in any hotel at any level--from the lower level chains to the Ritz. And to tell me they could not store the Ice packs--are they saying there is no freezer in their two restaurants and one bar? Scary idea!

With two great restaurants and a nice bar with a dj on site during happy hour, you can't go wrong. Gym is one of the best ones I've seen in a hotel in a long time.Long review: I've stayed in rooms on floors 2, 3, and 4 this far. The layout of my floor 4 room had a proper enclosed bathroom. Floors 2 and 3 have the open concept bathroom. Proper water closet and shower, with an open concept sink. Good TV channel offerings (right now it's Tour de France season, so I'm happy they have NBC Sports channel). The gym is rockin. I wish the scale was in a corner and not smack dab in the middle of the room, but I'll live. Lots of treadmills, ellipticals, free weights, fresh apples, water, chilled and dry towels! Restaurants are good too (will review those in detail on their respective profiles). Stopped by the bar and enjoyed the happy hour special, $7 caipirinhas and $5 apps. Both were tasty.

I understand there are some rooms with the mirrors provided. The hotel gives you a long list of sundries etc they are happy to bring to your room if you forgot anything. The iron and hair dryer were both much better than the ones I own. The snacks for sale were thoughtfully selected-if I had chosen to pay to eat them I couldn't have come up with a better selection.

Woke up at 5am - room service menu said breakfast didn't start until 6:30am - I waited 90 minutes so I could eat in my room while working. Called at 6:30 and was told the restaurant didn't open until 7:00am!! I could have walked to get breakfast somewhere nearby but waited stupidly believe the menu in the room. When I complained to the front desk, the customer service was horrible. Nothing offered to me for all this inconvenience!! At a minimum they could have offered a comp bfast at 7 for this but, nope - nothing, nada - even when I asked.2. Room was so small - distance from desk to bed was so tight the desk chair was bumping up to the bed. Very uncomfortable.3. What happened to bathtubs? Maybe it's all of NY, but I would expect to be told if my room had a shower only - I wasn't and now don't have any place to soak my muscles. At $450 a night this place is NOT worth the money!

Perhaps it is a bit harsh, but for the money paid, I expect more. Facilities, location, etc were mostly fine / good. I have stayed at some of the ""big"" times square hotels and had a better experience on most fronts.All staff were polite, courteous, tried to be helpful, etc, but plain old NOT helpful. If I'm laying down 5 star money, I want a full time concierge (hyatt relies on front desk to play this role most of the time) -- assistance with tickets, tourist info, booking restaurants, etc. So, for instance, I asked about tickets for wicked, getting a deal, etc. I mentioned that they seemed to be far from sold out online. They offer me seats for $270 per head through their ""ticket service"" and weren't really helpful in any other regard. We decide to just show up at the box office instead. We ended up paying roughly $100 per head for better seats. I read online ""ask your concierge as they have the know how/connections/etc"" -- yeh right.Another example, I saw a $40/hour chinese massage place nearby, but forgot where I saw the sign. I ask the front desk (concierge not working...it's like 2PM). They say they aren't aware of anything except for Chinatown. I walk out the door and literally 1.5 blocks away I see the massage parlour. Come on, you don't have to know all of NYC, but at least know your own 2 block radius.Help planning ahead. We emailed the concierge like 4 weeks in advance of our trip with some basic questions (after calling for him while he was out). Didn't hear back. Called again 1 week before. Didn't hear back. Called again a couple days later, finally heard back. Not on my original questions, but on a question I asked on my third call. Again, I realize they are not my own personal assistant, but come on, replying to an email within one week seems reasonable. I had basic questions (e.g. how to get reservations at XYZ, how to get tickets to the tonight show, how to get last minute broadway ticket deals)......quite ""common"" questionsRoom was a shoebox, but a quite nice shoebox. It's NYC after all. However, our room was next to some type of utility closet / room, so there was too much noise associated with that room (woke up a couple times, etc).","Portland, Oregon",6,1.0

We like to stay near Union Square. We typically stay at the W which is across the square but this time we could not get in. Having had brunch at the Hyatt we thought we would stay there. What a mistake. First of all the rooms are so small only one person can walk in front of the bed at a time. I know hotel space is challenging in NY but the W room is at least twice the size! Then, we did not receive our wake up call on our first morning...so strike relying on the hotel to get us up. When we complained, they offered us breakfast as a comp. The next night we asked if we could have drinks instead of the breakfast and they said yes. Guess what, that comp was $27.00. Try to have breakfast there and it sure isn't $27.00. When we went to check out, I was upset with the $27.00 comp so they bumped it up to the $60.00 drink charge but that was only after the guy on the desk was rude. When I said that the room was small he said that they are a ""Boutique Hotel"". I told him that ""Boutique"" does not mean tiny. We have stayed all over the world in Boutique Hotels and this is the tiniest hotel room I have ever stayed in. When I told him we usually stay across the street at the W he said that the rooms there are ""tired"". I think he needs to stay there....they are NOT tired.

The subway was less than a block away as well as just about every store and restaurant you could need. It was very central to just about everything in New York as well. The restaurant and bar downstairs were also very trendy and fun. I would stay here every single time I come back to New York. The only annoying thing was that the wifi has three levels. The free one had speeds up to 2mbps and if you paid extra you could get up to two levels higher for streaming. It wasn't worth the extra 15 or 35 bucks a day to get the higher speeds to me though.

Two large closet units are on each side of the bed(s) with a light that comes on when you open the door. The safe is in one closet so the light really comes in handy. There's a small desk area to charge electronics, as well as on the night stand. The room has a nice TV for the few mins you may want to watch it. As for comfort - central A/C and heat. No unit under the window to keep you awake and blow the curtains. And the bed is oh so glorious. I'm usually a poor sleeper in hotels but my family and I slept like the proverbial babies on the heavenly mattresses. Personally I love this location. Its quieter without being sleepy. It's away from the craziness of Times Square but a 20 minute cab ride to that area and the theaters. Union Square is right around the corner for shopping and restaurants and a stroll through the small park. Washington Square is a short walk away where you can hang out and watch singing, dancing, etc. In the distance you can see the 9-11 Memorial. This was our second trip to this Hyatt (NYU area) and we will be back. Shout-out to the staff who make a terrific hotel exceptional!","Stuart, Florida",9,5.0

They also offer complimentary shoe shines - I just dropped mine off in the morning the day I checked out and they were ready to go by noon.My only complaint would be the walls are pretty thin so you can hear your neighbors on either side of you and anyone in the hall pretty easily (and they can hear you).

We booked our reservation on-line on the Hyatt website using a special rate called “And the Winner Is”, in which each guest is presented with an envelope at check-in that offers a special perk such as a bottle of wine, a late check-out, or a room upgrade. We hoped for the room upgrade, because we had already booked a “better” room category of the Alcove Loft. (Therefore, the only categories to upgrade to are the Emphyreal Suite and The Sanctuary.) Much to our delight, the front-desk agent upgraded us to The Sanctuary (a 1-bedroom suite with a terrace) upon check-in! What an awesome surprise!The Hyatt Union Square is located on Fourth Avenue at 13th Street in the Union Square / Gramercy / Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan. The property is located one block from Union Square itself, and many shops and restaurants are right outside of its doors. Two drugstores, Walgreens and Duane Reed, border Union Square; in addition to pharmacy items, both stores operate as mini-markets, selling drinks, snacks, reading material, and so on.The Sanctuary Suite is located on the second floor of the hotel, as are all of the Terrace rooms. The room number for The Sanctuary is 211. (We believe that the other rooms ending in “11” are the Alcove Loft rooms, which are all corner suites and offer slightly more room to their occupants.) The best feature of the Sanctuary is the 1,000-square foot L-shaped terrace. Because the living room area is positioned on the corner of the building, the room contains floor-to-ceiling windows, each set of which has automatic blinds and sheer drapes that open and close with the touch of a button. You can access the terrace from both the living room and the bedroom. Unfortunately, we stayed in this room in the winter, so we did not get to fully enjoy the outdoor space, but it contains many different pieces of outdoor furniture, such as a dining table / chairs for six people, two single-person lounge chairs, one double two-person lounge chair, two sofas, two chairs, several outdoor lamps, and potted plants / foliage. The terrace must be an amazing space when the weather is nice! The room itself features wood floors, leather wall panels, and suede ceiling tiles. The oversized suite includes a separate living room with a 2-piece futon-like sofa, dining table / chairs for four people, large free-standing iPod speaker cube, and unique kind of mini-bar. The bedroom features a king-size bed, second flat screen TV (incorporated into the mirror of the dresser unit). The two-part bathroom contains a huge walk-in shower for two people and a large sink vanity. The toilet cubicle is in another area that you can closed off with sliding pocket doors, and it has a second tiny free-standing sink in an area that can also be closed off. (Note that the description of this room online mentions a “separate powder room”, however, this room contains only one toilet. Although this room contains two sinks in different parts of the large bathroom, it does not incorporate what we think of as a “powder room” meaning an additional “half-bathroom”.) Two bathrobes (but no slippers) hung near the shower, and larger-than-normal (perhaps 5-ounce) bottles of CO Bigelow toiletries (including shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion) were located in a recessed area of the shower. In the living room, The Sanctuary contains a door that permits it to adjoin with a terrace suite, creating a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom unit when both units are rented.We previously stayed at the Hyatt Union Square in October of 2013 (see our previous review for more information on the hotel features). Our second stay was just as pleasant as our first stop, and we plan to visit this hotel again.

You know what they say, it means everything. Well this hotel was in the perfect location for me. It's just off Union Square so there is lots to see and do in the area that's minutes away. Its just around the corner from the Strand Bookstore in the Village, amazingly good restaurants on 2nd Avenue like Veselka or Ippudo on 4th Ave. It's an easy walking distance to Washington Square, Christopher, Bleeker and Spring Streets, The Highline, Meatpacking district, and Houston Street - some of the best neighborhoods in the city. It's also around the corner from Whole Foods Market on Union Square in case you want to pick something up or have a quick bite to eat without the sit-down restaurant prices and/or the choice of bad fast food. Most importantly this hotel is a decent distance from the really commercial touristy areas around Times Square and midtown Manhattan. So if you want to be in the 'thick of things like Times Square' this isn't so close.This Hyatt - Union Square has a small but smart, unimposing entrance and there is a little lobby with a bar to the right and restaurant to the left as you walk in... nothing grand or imposing. Maybe because I was there during New Years Eve, it seems like it was hectic - private parties and dinners on many nights.Staff seemed a bit harried. I thought the service was good to adequate... professional but not overtly friendly. I tried to order room service on New Years Eve - no response, no dice. But then it was New Years Eve. And they misquoted me the price of the taxi to the airport - it was $20.00 more than they quoted. The room was smallish but typical of NYC, I chose a cheaper option. The space was beautifully styled with good little additions like the ipod dock, comfy bathrobe and good quality toiletries. It had a shower no bathtub, but that suited us just fine. There were 2 problems I identified - there was no free wifi in our room, (it's not cheap and adds a bit to your room's bill) and I was on the fourth floor and it was a bit noisy - but not street noise more like mechanical, elevator noise. The hotel asked me for feedback and I told them about the noise and they seemed sincere in wanting to have it fixed. So maybe it's not an issue now.","Toronto, Canada",18,4.0

Staff is a bit informal but professional. The design is very urban and modern. Our room (City Studio category) was very small, but otherwise adequate and very clean. It was equipped with TV, ipod dock, and a quite large safe that would even hold a laptop. A big plus compared to other NYC hotels I stayed in was the absence of noise: despite facing the street (7th floor), there was barely any road noise - even none of the honking. Being just around the corner from Union Square, the location is amazing. From Union Sq. public transport connects well to midtown and downtown Manhattan, but also to Brooklyn. It is even easy to walk to Eastside, Soho, Nolita etc. Around the hotel you find many coffee shops, bars and restaurants of various categories (we never had breakfast in the hotel since there were so many options around). There are also a number of convenience stores around Union Square. Previously I stayed in Midtown on all my NYC visits, but from now on I prefer to stay around Union Square. Hyatt is an excellent option, but next time I would aim for one of the bigger rooms, if budget allows. Oh and there is free wifi in the lobby, but we were lucky since we still received that in our room.",London,15,4.0

Let's begin with the outstanding customer service and complimentary tray of cheese and wine sent to my room with a hand penned note. I was floored by the wood floors in the rooms! No carpets? I was so impressed by this, rarely does one find hard wood floors in a chain…I would say this Hyatt far exceeds most boutique hotels I have scrutinized. The prices are fantastic for value. They have room service that is quite eclectic and reasonable. They aim to please. Story told, it used to be a club with a dance bar downstairs. If you see , which you will as I took many pictures, it is divine. The food is outstanding as well as the concierge. Transportation is simple, most everything in walking distance, Penn Station close, and a great Hotel to hold a conference. Parking not an issue if you do desire to drive as there is parking on most streets as apposed to a parking fee that would meet a mortgage payment. Aside from that, I stayed there, as my daughter had several appointments to chose a wedding gown. They are all in walking distance. If you go to Kleinfelds, do not choose the W hotel they suggest, go with the Hyatt Union Square. I also ate at The Fourth restaurant in hotel. I am a chef, designer, and it was to perfection.

Service was excellent a faulty bedside light was fixed promptly and the location is superb. Forget staying around the touristy Times Square as Union Square is much more interesting with twice a week farmer markets, tons of great restaurants and most subway lines that will get you pretty much anywhere.

The ONLY reason for which I'm not giving them 5 stars, is because house keeping did leave behind a couple of things that I would expect to be picked up... dirty coffee cups, granola bar wrappers, etc. I was provided with a survey after check out, and contacted directly by the hotel to discuss my comments, which leads me to believe and feel they really care about guest satisfaction.

Our room was spotless and, despite its modern aesthetic, felt pretty cozy. It wasn't noisy at all in the hallways either. Overall, great experience there. One minor criticism--no doorman or bellhop either of the two times we came back to the hotel (we only stayed overnight). Maybe it was a coincidence and someone is usually manning the door. But, when we checked in on a Friday, no one was there to open the door and take our luggage. A doorman is a nice touch. Our only wish is that we'd stayed long enough to eat at the restaurant and check out the hotel bar.","Los Angeles, California",10,5.0

Our room was “the urbane studio” Room 613. It was VERY quiet with the most comfortable king size bed & luxurious pillows and sheets. NYC is called ""The City That Never Sleeps” but we both got the BEST sleep every night. The beautiful blackout curtains completely block out a ray of light.-I took a picture of the beautiful sheer curtain pattern. One morning we woke at 9am! OMG! If you have to be somewhere, set your alarm or ask for a wakeup call.The room is a small space; about 350 sq. ft. but every bit of space is utilized efficiently. The shower is a good size with great hot water and water pressure. The small vanity area was very efficient for my husband to shave his face & for me to put on the makeup—great lighting.The downstairs lobby is very inviting if you're meeting friends or just want to get out of the room for a bit to read the NY Times. It is a dog friendly hotel too. My daughter-in-law came by with the doggie and we just sat and chatted in the lobby. It is a very soothing and calming atmosphere.One caveat- don't be tempted by the mini bar or snack bar in the room, LOL. The sticker prices are outrageous: Snickers bar $5, beef jerky $7, Dean & Deluca gummy bears $10, 1 liter of Fiji water, $7—ridiculous! Walgreens is across the street on 13th and there are stores all over the square for anything you need.I want to give a shout out to some very special employees that made our 6 day stay very pleasant. The Doormen: Joseph Barnes and Chris Sing both greeted us each time with a wonderful smile & what seemed to be genuine interest in our plans for the day. At the Front Desk Victor Marrero and Sam Gustafsson were very helpful in answering any of our “touristy questions” which I’m sure they have heard numerous times. Also, Valerie in housekeeping, she made our room up quite a number of the days, even working on Christmas Eve Day with no complaint when I’m sure she would have liked being home with her family. I do hope the manager of the hotel will pass these compliments on to these very wonderful men & women. I feel a business is only as good as the people who work there!",Mass.,18,5.0

Additionally, it is close (a short block) from the nearest subway station. It was nice to be in this location as it was also close to the Union Square Holiday Market. The room itself was not too cramped and could fit both of our bags without trouble. The bathroom was beautiful - large waterfall shower (you can shave your legs without bumping into a wall) and separate water closet. The bed was super comfortable, I didn't want to get out of it in the cold, cold mornings. Plugs to charge all your various electronics were numerous (I hate it when there aren't any plugs by the bed)! The staff was friendly enough, but perhaps a little aloof, I didn't really care though.The only ""gripes"" I can think of is that there was low pressure for the toilet (which made it not flush very well) and that the room itself has a plank flooring... for some reason I was expecting carpet.

The bell staff was so helpful and they always had a smile on their faces.But the main reason for staying in a hotel is the room, and this is where this hotel fell short. First, the room was very small; so small that I actually stubbed my toe a number of time stepping out of bed (hit my rollaway; because there was not other place for it). The bathroom; while very nice, was tiny, And lastly, the hotel was very noisy. Not so much from the street (that is expected in NYC), but from the hallways and most notably some weird sounds coming through the air vents.

The rooms are not big (but what room is in NYC?!?) however they provide all the modern facilities you will need to be comfortable. The check-in and check-out process is very quick, the staff are very friendly, the room rates are reasonable and the restaurants are excellent...

There aren't enough adjectives to describe how excellent the service is at every level in this hotel. I travel 10 days a month for work. The staff, from bellmen to front desk, restaurant and housekeeping had an uncanny ability to read my mood and respond wonderfully. I'd almost say psychic. I arrived early and read in the lobby for a bit while I waited for my room. They treated every guest the same way.Restaurant - I didn't expect a lot . Sandwiched between the east and west village walking distance to some of the best food on earth, here was this gem. The food was fantastic, well thought out menu. Better yet and yup I can't say enough about it, the service. If this is your first trip to Manhattan, do not drink or eat here first. The experience will leave you woefully unprepared for dining in other places. They are friendly, they look you in the eye, they'll give you great tips for other places to try. In a nut shell they made every person in a fairly packed restaurant feel like they were the only party there. Location- Perfect. Very safe tons to do in walking distance.

The hotel also has a great gym, all the equipment you need is there, it's larger than the typical hotel gym. There are 2 dinning establishments and 1 bar and of course room service.

The restaurants are not operated by Hyatt, the are part of One five Hospitably Group.In the beginning I've had some service issues... but I had hopes the hotel would improve. I'm happy to report it has. I can really see the effort from management to staff, it seems their aim is to be one of the best hotels in NYC. The Fourth Restaurant seems to be making an effort as well. I have definitely seen an improvement in service during my past 3 stays. I know some other have said the hotel seems a bit too hip... well this is what Union Square and the Village is all about! Sadly gentrification has changed the character of this colorful part of NYC, but it's still the center of hip-ville, it's diverse, vibrant and artistic...but more in a hipster sort of way (UGH).

I went alone for the first trip and used points so had a small but very nice room on the interior of the hotel. No complaints here- there was plenty of space for me, a ton of plugs and tech options and it was quiet. Going back with my husband, though, I wanted a larger room so booked an alcove loft room which are on the corners of the hotel. The room was very spacious and had a sitting area as well as the bed. Again, we had all the plugs we needed and not 1 but 2 huge flat screen TVs. The room had windows overlooking both 4th Ave and 13th street which was awesome. I would recommend you take a sound machine (as I did) or earplugs as there is a fire station about a half block away. Even with the sound machine, we heard the fire truck go out several times during the night. The windows open and although we kept them closed at night, it was very nice to be able to open them during the day and get the nice fall breezes. The showers in this hotel are amazing. They have wide rain fall shower heads with plenty of pressure that makes for a lovely shower. Everything is new and contemporary. The shower had walls made of small oval tiles- a beautiful but expensive effect. The only thing I would change is the closet which is very small and more of an armoire. I like to hang my clothes whenever possible and we filled it up right away. It's not a deal breaker, though. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We were greeted every time we left or returned to the hotel- not the norm for New York. They have clearly assembled a top notch group of employees who genuinely enjoy their jobs.

It's a superb property in a city where you often roll the dice with lodging - even with well respected brands. There are a few things that make this hotel stand out from the rest:1. It's New: Everything is fresh, clean, and stylish without taking itself too seriously. It does modern well. A (big, huge) benefit of being new is that they constructed it well - this is without a doubt the quietest hotel I've stayed at in the city. Contrast with another hotel I've stayed where earplugs are an amenity...2. The Staff: They're well trained, courteous, and demonstrate a high EQ. Most times I'm checking in after a morning of travel and a full day of work - they read this well and make the check-in friendly but efficient. No unnecessary chit-chat, unless of course that's what I'm looking for, then they're skilled at that as well and are always willing to consider (and accommodate, when applicable) a request.3. The rooms: They have a really nice variety of rooms including some with spacious garden patios. Here's the thing I love - If you're in one of their smallest rooms, you don't really know it. The decor is modern but functional, which means the space is well used. The bathroom facilities are well designed and I love the shower - roomy, big shower head, perfect water pressure, and easy water temp adjustment. The products are nice as well.4. The Gym: I hate missing a workout just because of travel. And nothing is more disappointing then then finding out a hotel's gym is nothing more than a 20 year old treadmill and a random dumbbell. No worries here - their gym is TOP NOTCH. Brand new equipment to meet whatever your needs - cardio, free weights, machines, core station, etc. The have a filtered water machine but also provided bottled water, towels, COLD TOWELS, headphones for tvs mounted on cardio machines, and apples for post-workout recovery :) It's spacious so you can do whatever your little (strong) heart desires.Bottom-line: I have a choice of hotels for business travel and this will always be #1, but I wouldn't think twice about staying here for personal travel as well. It is absolutely my favorite in the city, and it's made me a loyal Hyatt customer.","Potomac Falls, Virginia",1,5.0

I only wish that I could have stayed here longer as I was hardly here 24 hours so I could not enjoy all of the ammenties offered. The front desk was very helpful upon check-in and provided a wealth of information about the area. What's very clever and what other hotels should do is that they provided a list of restaurants that are recommended by the staff. This would not work at a larger format hotel but it completely suited the boutique aspect of this even though it was a Hyatt.The room was well appointed and what you would expect in size for a basic room in NYC. Quiet for the area which I really appreciated. My favorite things were the openness of the restaurant and lounges. The weather was wonderful so the floor to ceiling glass doors were open on the street. The location is IDEAL for the area. It is not just on Union Square which could be quite loud, but just a block or two away so everything was in distance.Only drawback was that the service in the restaurant was sometimes a bit slow and the host rather distracted at the beginning.

The hotel has a great bistrot that I also frequented a bit.

I'm quite selective when it comes to hotels as well. I'm so lucky to have found this relatively new Hyatt property in a prime location in NYC. It is located right off the Union Square subway stop (the entrance for the train is like a block away). The area is perfect for both business (like myself) and tourist. Every type of restaurant, shopping, and convenient store is around the corner. I love this area of the city because Union Square has an open air market with local vendors who sell fresh flowers, veggies and other items. Plus you can't beat the abundance of street entertainers!Before I entered the hotel, I was warmly greeted by the bellmen who ushered me to the front desk where I was graciously greeted again by the front desk staff. I so wish I could remember names because this would be a great time to mention those who helped me. A gentleman took my bags to my room and also assisted me in hailing a cab once I returned to the lobby (I was headed to an event that evening).Of course NYC doesn't have 'spacious' hotel rooms (as I'm not sure anything is spacious in the city), but the way in which every element of the room was appointed made the room feel larger. The mirrors and lighting gave the room depth. I believe while I was gone, someone came in and closed the drapes and placed chocolates on the pillow! I promise that was not there when I initially entered the room earlier that afternoon. The bed was super comfy and the shower was hot and full pressure. I honestly didn't want to get up in the morning. Another bonus is the hotel uses C.O. Bigelow products (i.e. soap, shampoo, conditioner)...who doesn't like C.O. Bigelow?! Check out the next morning was smooth and like the previous night, the gentleman assisted me in hailing a cab back to Penn Station. I was quite impressed by the Property Manager, Jennifer who personally emailed me to see how my stay was at her hotel...seriously, it was a personal email, no autofil. I greatly appreciated that email and it really speaks to the quality of Hyatt hotels and their customer service, and more specifically this property in NYC.

It was my first stay at the Hyatt Union Square.1) Upon arrival the bellman greeted me at my taxi and offered to bring my bags to reception. I find this to be very helpful as the most difficult step for the traveler with a carry-on and briefcase is navigating out of the back of a cab, a technical challenge, and then across the sidewalk or entryway with his valuables meaning expensive items such as computers and no less valuable items such as socks! It is common today to have a person ask if you need help after you've already arrived at reception which I generally do not take advantage of because I live out rolling bags and can easily find my way to the elevator and room. Not the case at the Hyatt Union Square making a great first impression.2) The lobby is modern and upscale without being over the top. The reception staff was very helpful and efficient. The room smaller than a typical setting (square footage is at a premium in NYC) but very nicely furnished. Reception brought a bottle of Cabernet (my favorite) as a welcome gift. Nice touch. Classy. 3) The bed and linens are superb and the room (on back of the building) is quiet and enjoyable.4) I especially enjoyed my dinner at ""The Fourth"", a restaurant conveniently located right of the lobby. The atmosphere and music were arty and calming. The food was a delightful surprise! I truly did not expect to experience world-class food. The Rouget appetizer and Sea Bas entree were as good as it gets - and I'l eaten at many of the best restaurants in the world traveling to more than 50 countries. Wow! I think the fish was as good or better than the Metropole in Monaco if that is even possible. My waiter was attentive but not pushy. I eat in restaurants everyday. I enjoy upscale and dives alike. When the food quality and preparation is of such a high caliber one appreciates the service to match - my experience was top notch. Thank you for that - and at a fair price BTW.5) Didn't find the remote for the TV in the room so I left a note for housekeeping - upon returning to the room and still no TV remote, I called and a remote was delivered within ten minutes. I like the multi-mode digital interface so that I can use the TV display with my laptop and iPad.

I have been spoiled by the Park Hyatt in DC where I stayed Jan-March this year almost every week while working in DC. They are as close to perfection as can be, and my expectations have been set accordingly. As a platinum member, I try to stay at the Hyatt as much as possible, but not all of them measure up. I am pleased to say that the Union Square Hyatt measured up 100%. From superb functionality of the room, to super friendly staff, everything was excellent during my stay. And when I say room functionality, I mean every little piece of space used and all with the traveler's convenient in mind. Including power outlets by the desk and superb internet. Soundproofing is pretty good too and the AC is whisper quiet. All the supplies which for me constitute hospitality were available and waiting for me in the room. From a complementary bottle of water delivered daily, to a robe and slippers or a coffee maker. The staff was always meeting your eyes with a smile and a friendly remark. Any request was accommodated, including stowing my bag between two stays. That's Hospitality with a capital H for me. I have tried three Hyatts in NY. Grand Central, Andaz5th Ave and now Union Square. Grand Central is lousy on the hospitality score and I am not going back after they made a bad internet in my room, my problem to resolve with their vendor. Plus you need to call to ask for anything you need or you won't get it; things like a robe or coffee maker you call houskeeping and you need to ask for water at the front desk each and every day (which means if there is a long checki/checkout line, you are out of luck). Andaz and Union Square Hyatt are both excellent and on par. Kudos to Union Square for meeting these standards with a lower price point!. If I may suggest one slight area for improvement it woudl be replacing the powdered creamer with the liquid ones. Powdered creamer says Motel6 to me. On the next visit I will probably store some milk in the minibar for my coffee.Internet is free for platinum members, otherwise it costs $10 a day. I stayed in the Sky room on the 11th floor, facing 4th avenue. It costs a bit more but it's totally worth it. The view was pretty nice and light was excellent. There was no noise from the street except perhaps an occasional police siren. Blackout curtains shielded from the street lights very well.

Our upgrade was the same tiny room only looking out to a busy street rather than an internal courtyard. Not really an upgrade! The room on a high floor was absolutely minuscule and the decor and finishes, looked cheapish. Its a newl hotel, and its going to be out of fashion in 5 minutes! I knew from the photos the room would be small, so I hadn't ordered a twin room, but I didn't realise how small! There was a curved desk -gotta love the desk -with no cupboards under that made the tiny space even harder to get around, and an elliptical mini bar/coffee area that again took up valuable floor space. There was no storage in the bedside tables except one drawer on one and magazine space on the other side. The robe was 3feet wide at best and half taken up with 2 shallow drawers and the safe, and the other hanging half included the ironing board! We had to put 2 cases and our cabin bag in storage to avoid a complete obstacle course! Bathroom actually bigger than Grand Central Hyatt, with excellent shower pressure and nice amenities.

The hostess was good but the two male waiters were average to ordinary. We waited 45 minutes for our main course on a fairly quiet night. I was then up all night with food poisoning from around 4am and couldn't go out the last evening to the restaurant we'd been looking forward to as I was still so ill and I'm never sick!

We chose not to eat breakfast in the hotel and instead opted for bagels and coffee from the coffee shop opposite the hotel, or ate a larger cooked breakfast at a local diner a few blocks away called Joe Junior’s. The Union square area was the perfect place to stay. You are within an easy walking distance of many sites and on the main subway lines if you prefer to take the train. We did a mix of both and easily accessed the whole of Manhattan. We even managed to go to watch the Mets one evening and get the subway home in the early hours with no issues.

The front desk offered to send up a make-up mirror ""right away"", but it arrived after I left the room, over an hour later. The light on the mirror was broken when it finally did arrive.

We were there celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. I never expect an up-grade as I feel I am paying for the room I booked. When checking in and having a casual conversation with Amanda,she asked why we were in the city,we told her,and all of the sudden,we were given an upgrade! Nice,especially when not expecting it! Our room had a huge terrace!!Amanda at the front desk was excellent,as was every staff member we encountered-friendly,not stuffy or arrogant! The location:can't be beat!! We love the union Square area. Great restaurants,the market,easy access to Soho,the Village and,midtown.There is a subway stop right there,but it is a great walking location. The lobby and hotel bar are beautiful,nice for cocktails before going out. Check out the flower arrangements in the lobby,they are stunning! Rooms-the rooms are small,even by NY standards,but they are layed out perfect,with every high tech gadget imaginable. We didn't mind the size,because it had good lighting,excellent bedding,the best hair dryer,high end toiletries,excellent shower,and was spotless!! Turn-down was lovely with candy and soft music. If you can,get a terrace room.We had a huge terrace with table and chairs...we could have had a cocktail party out there!!  The gym:this is important to my husband,and the gym is super nice,well equipped,clean,towels,fruit and water bottles all available.My husband usually buys a day pass and hits a nice gym/health-club,but did not need to when we stayed here. Don't be put off by this being a ""Hyatt""...as I was a little worried and generally prefer smaller boutique hotels.This Hyatt is not your typical chain hotel. If you have any questions let me know.... My son goes to school in the city and I have stayed at a ton of NY hotels,if you need any comparisons!! Enjoy the city!!Thanks again Amanda,and all the doormen,you were all great,so fun coming back to your friendly smiles after exploring the city all day!!","Baltimore, Maryland",152,5.0

Upon checking in the hotel staff were friendly and helpful but after that completely hopeless. We were offered a morning paper which we only received the first morning and then my husband had to call every day after that to request it. We made other requests throughout our stay with the requests form left by housekeeping in the room which were never ever provided. The rooms were modern and clean but extremely small, particularly the bathroom area. There was limited space to hang and store items.It wasn't exactly honeymoon material and we were left feeling disappointed.

We chose to upgrade to an 'Urbane Terrace' room which incidentally gave us access to a small private courtyard. However given this was mid-Feb and the outdoor daytime temperature was around -6C with heavy snow on the ground, we opted to remain indoors! However the additional large windows and light were a welcome positive. On the downside, the door to the terrace didn't shut tightly and so there was a cool draft detectable when the curtains weren't closed. I would suggest the Urbane Terrace would be a good option during the Spring/Summer, particularly as the air conditioning was extremely noisy whenever we put it on quickly to get some heat in the room.The room was spotless and remained so throughout our stay. The shower was powerful and hot and the CO Bigelow shower gel, shampoos and soaps were replenished often. There was no bath in our room.We used the gym twice during our stay. It contains a good range of modern Life Fitness cardio machines and is located in the basement level. There are about 4 treadmills and 2 or 3 elliptical machines plus a rower and some resistance machines. There are workout towels and water, plus disposable headphones if you've forgotten yours. However change in your room as there are no changing facilities in the gym.We had after-dinner drinks in the bar ""Singl"" a couple of times during our stay and it was a pleasant, cool place to return. The bar specialises in single malt whiskeys and also offers a range of bourbons and rye whiskeys. If you want some advice and recommendations on what to drink then I would opt for sitting at the bar so that you can talk to the bartender directly. On our first visit we made the mistake of sitting on one of the sofas and an air-headed girl served us. She was obviously employed to look good, rather than have any knowledge of what she was serving. We asked for a recommendation from the slightly bewildering menu of whiskeys and she just vaguely pointed at something, not good. However the second time we visited we sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely knowledgable and friendly offering lots of advice and suggestions for what we should try.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, and instead opted for one of the many diners within walking distance. For instance Grey Dog Cafe on University Place or Big Daddy's on Park Avenue.On our last day our return flight home to London wasn't until 2230 and so we asked for a late check-out. As we are Hyatt Platinum members we were able to secure a complimentary late check-out until 1600 which was really helpful on the day.","London, United Kingdom",155,4.0

I left our car with two heavy suitcases on wheels and arrived at two massive heavy glass doors with no doorman on duty. So I had to fight and push my way in, breaking a suitcase wheel in the process. It had been a long trip and I was looking forward to a hot bath but wasn't permitted to check in because I wasn't my wife, who had made the reservation. She got lost while trying to park, and I sat in the lobby for close to forty-five minutes. I won't spend a lot of time on the godawful aesthetics of the lobby (think of a woodpile on strings, beds chained together with wood and hung from the ceiling, bird and feather decals on the wall), but it will certainly look much less impressive in just a few short years. It's scented with some perfume 24/7. You cannot enter the hotel without having to exchange friendly greetings with the desk staff.The Courtyard Studio rooms are tiny. The peculiar moderne decor contnues into the rooms, of course. No hot bath after all: just a large shower enclosure. No bathroom, in fact: toilet in a tiny closet, sink and mirror in the bedroom. No place for your clothes except a small wardrobe and three shallow drawers perhaps 14"" x 14"". No folding luggage racks, so living out of your suticase is out: we hid them behind the curtain. No towel racks. No ice machines: it took 45 minutes and two calls to the desk to get ice delivered to our room. Connecting door to the adjacent 'studio' meant very poor soundproofing: we had to knock on the door to get our neighbors to quiet down. The lights are all ganged onto a master switch system which dims up and down when turned on but can't be dimmed in actual use. An open-plan minibar takes up valuable counter space: you don't want to ask what gummi bears cost here.Is this the chain that makes a thing about their mattresses? The bed was mad comfortable. Staff is very friendly if you don't mind the greeting routine on every re-entrance; hotel is neat and new. I just don't like the place.","Portland, Maine",8,2.0

I was offered assistance getting a cab, but not once was I offered assistance with my suitcases or packages until I was walking passed the front desk which was a bit too late.The hotel lobby is very dark . The desk staff is friendly enough , although it can be hard to find an ""adult in charge"". The rooms are spotless although tiny. They are equipped with nice toiletries and thick towels. The decor is a cross between European and Ikea and bright and certainly cheerful. The couch was cute but the shape shouted ""do not try to get comfortable on me! "".

Rooms beautifully designed, the bed & pillows so comfortable - probably the best sleep I have had for a long time in any hotel. Fantastic walk in shower with lovely amenities and although the room was quite compact It was really well designed, with real attention to detail & had everything we needed for our stay. Loved the location - easy to walk everywhere and liked the village feel next to Grenwich village whilst been able to walk up town easily. What set this hotel really apart was the staff: They made us feel so at home throughout our stay, so attentive, friendly and welcoming (a real credit to the Hyatt brand). The only feedback I would give to the hotel would be to get a kettle in the room as well as the small coffee machine, and found the in room dining a bit limited and overpriced (even for NY) so didn't dine in the room this time. Also great gym but needed some better mats and excercise balls.However these are just minor points for feedback and plan to go back very soon as we loved our stay here! If the GM or other member of staff read this could they reach out as I would love some advice re booking the room for my next trip - perhaps would go for city rather than courtyard room & want to book on a high floor!Thanks to all the Hyatt staff for such a memorable New Year!!

The rooms are not huge, but they are well-layed out and cram a lot of amenities in a small space.

The hotel is very attractive with a good location, very easy to get to when driving. From the valet to the check in, everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. We had requested early check in, and even though they were quite busy, they were able to accommodate us, and in fact, upgraded us to a room with a terrace! Too bad it was so cold, it would have been so nice to have coffee or drinks outside. The room was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated, the bed was very comfortable. There was plenty of storage space and we like having a separate toilet area. The sink is blocked off by a partial wall, lets in plenty of light, so it's great for putting on make up, with counter space and drawers, plus there are plenty of well lit mirrors. There is a nice restaurant, good food, great Bloody's and there is also a cool bar on the other side of the front desk, drinks there are good but very pricey. Bathrooms are located downstairs and are Unisex, very nice and clean. They also have a gym and roof top terrace, neither of which we used.

We remitted Hyatt gift cards for our stay, and we were able to use multiple gift cards to pay the bill, which we turned over at check-in time. (The representative that checked us in said that not all clerks knew how to reconcile the gift cards, so she wanted to speed up our time at check-out by taking them at check-in.) We booked our reservation online a few months prior to our stay, and re-checked the rates every week or so until the day prior to our stay. Our rates dropped two times after we had made our original booking, resulting in a savings of nearly $200 over our original rate. (Each time we rebooked, the rate dropped by about $100; so we recommend checking back your rate if you would like to save some money.)The hotel is somewhat new, having opened in the spring of 2013. It occupies a corner location in the Union Square/Flatiron/Gramercy Park area of the city, and is located just one block from Union Square Park. Several subway lines stop near the hotel, and it is also easy to hail a taxi cab because the hotel is located on busy Fourth Avenue. The hotel does not have a parking lot, although valet parking is available. There are many shops and restaurants in the surrounding blocks, including a wine shop, grocery store (Whole Foods), and two pharmacies (Duane Reed and Walgreens) in the very next block. The Union Square Greenmarket (a must-see on Saturdays) is just a block away. The hotel has 178 room arranged over 12 floors.The front desk is a sort of standing podium/table workstation that contains computer terminals. The staff wears long-sleeved multi-colored checked oxford shirts as sort of a uniform. All employees that we encountered were pleasant and helpful. The hotel offers complimentary bicycles for guests to use - sometimes they were present in the lobby near the elevators, and other times they were borrowed. The bikes are a vintage Schwin style, with a box/basket mounted on the back for bags/backpacks. The fitness center, located on the basement level, has all the necessary equipment (treadmills, bikes, free weights) and also offers regular towels, cool towels (in a little refrigerator), bottled water, fresh fruit, and disposable headphones. One of the few things that we did not like about this hotel was the fragrance that permeated the lobby and elevators – an intensely spicy scent that we found it pervasive and unpleasant.Although we did not dine at the hotel, it has several food and beverage outlets: Singl is the hotel bar and lounge, with bar stool seating and many comfortable and varied social groupings of furniture open from late afternoon through early morning. Botequim is on the basement level and serves dinner only, Latin tapas cuisine in a space with an open kitchen. The Fourth is a large American brasserie located on the street level and serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The Fourth has three dining areas: a café with an espresso and wine bar, a communal dining bar, and a more full-service formal dining space. Room service is also available from early morning until late evening. A rooftop bar/lounge is planned to open in the spring of 2014. We think that the dining options have potential, because they are owned by a restaurant group that also manages Tocqueville Restaurant and 15 East (15 East has one Michelin star).We booked the lowest-level room, the Urbane Studio, although we applied for a (paying) e-upgrade at check-in time (which was not available). Our room faced an interior courtyard and did not have floor-to-ceiling windows, which seemed to be the major difference between the Urbane Studio and the Deluxe Studio (Urbane Sky Room). We would love to have seen one of the Urban Terrace rooms or the suites (Empyreal or The Sanctuary). Our room was compact, but not tiny by New York City standards. The furniture was cleverly designed and used every available space. The bathroom vanity area was a bit compact, but the shower was large. CO Bigelow toiletries are provided (soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion). A hair dryer, iron and ironing board, and electronic safe are provided. A minibar and snack tray are available. There is no ice machine for guest use, but you can request a (complimentary) delivery from room service. In our room, one robe (a black jersey material) and one pair of slippers were provided. The hotel provided an evening turndown, although it occurred much too early for us to take advantage of it (around 5:00 pm). Instead of mints on your pillow, the hotel offers fortune cookies, which is a unique touch.We would gladly stay at the Hyatt Union Square again.

The location was a bit further downtown than I had hoped (4th & 13th), but it was usually a quick cab or Subway ride (10-20 min) to midtown for shopping, sightseeing, etc. It's a small, tucked away hotel, but I really liked that about it. The lobby and bar are beautifully designed - contemporary and interesting while still feeling cozy. The restaurant (Fourth) is the perfect breakfast spot before heading out. The food is fabulous and they offer a jazz brunch on Sundays. The rooms are small, but that is typical NYC. They were really well appointed, clean and comfortable. And the staff was everything we could have hoped for. Lots of great ideas for us and help when we needed it. It feels so intimate that it is almost like staying at a B&B, but with the niceties of a larger hotel chain. Just avoid the $10 water bottles in the room and restaurant. I understand the typical mark up of water bottles, but $10 for a small bottle of Fiji? Really? I bought one out of desperation once (NY will make you thirsty!), but then walked down the street to Duane Read for $2 bottles the next time.

We had previously stayed in Hyatt Andez on Wall Street and the Hyatt in Midtown. After staying at all three of these locations, I feel I can accurately give each of these a fair review. I arrived on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving earlier than the normal check in time. Not only was I greeted warmly, but I was given a room right away with no having to wait around. The downside, a heavy odor of vanilla or something that lingers in the main lobby that tends to drift into the restaurant which can interfere with the dining experience. When I got up to the room, the first thing I noticed that for the size of the room it was, the designer made the most of every little inch. It still had a somewhat spacious feeling for a room that would be my bedroom back home. I did not go crazy over the decor, but I know this Hyatt uses the designer of Paul Vega as a huge selling point. After sleeping for the night and hanging out in the room these are the main things I noticed that were uncomfortable/disappointing/a nuisance: We had a connecting door room and our neighbors did not respect that when in hotels you should respect people and keep voices down, so children were yelling and banging around at 6 in the morning. We were also placed directly across from where the staff either loads/unloads carts or has services and was constantly banging around, which leads to my next point The walls are EXTREMELY THIN. It is like when they redid the building they did not add any additional insulation, and this now rounds out the last major point The windows LET IN EVERYTHING. I understand we are in the city. There are going to be noises, but when I am on the 10th floor and I can hear EVERYTHING that is going down on the street and when I get close to the window I can feel the cold leaking in, it's like the windows are only single-paned. I was using the desk by the window, the curtains were drawn shut, the heat was on, and I was wrapped in a blanket because I was freezing. It really seems to me that the designer spent his budget on the design and not the functionality of the architecture or having a balance of both. So, I will make a pros and cons list for you to consider if you decide to stay here. Pros: Clean Great Staff Good location Comfortable bed Cons: Thin walls Thin windows Small rooms Beware of where the associate places are","Omaha, Nebraska",3,3.0

The hotel is in a good location for exploring the City on foot and is surrounded by excellent cafes, The Strand Bookshop and Max Brenner's chocolate cafe and shop. There is an excellent pizza restuarant just down the road and the subway station (to get to mid-town or up-town) is a few minutes walk away. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as there wasn't much choice for vegetarians (mainly eggs and toast) so we ate in the coffee shop ""Think Coffee"" opposite. We did have dinner in the hotel once - the service and food were excellent in the Fourth Restaurant. The hotel rooms are modern and clean and comfortable. We had a courtyard room. After the first night we asked to move rooms as we were on a low floor overlooking the courtyard where there is a noisy air con/generator outside on the courtyard which is on 24/7. We moved to a higher floor and couldn't hear it then. The air con/heating in the rooms is very noisy so you can't sleep with it on. We left the heating on whilst out and switched it off when we were in the room. What really makes this hotel great is the staff who are so helpful and have a great customer service ethic.

Rooms are spotlessly clean; the decor is fresh and modern; the beds a good size and comfortable; space is at a premium but the designers have made the best use of it; the location is fantastic and the young staff are very friendly. The rooms fall a little short in two respects - the double glazing isn't the best so there is a reasonable amount of street noise and the air conditioning is both ferocious and noisy meaning you can't hope to sleep with it on with the result that it can get very warm overnight. On this basis I'd probably normally look to rate as a 4 however I think it's the little things that matter and here I think the hotel falls down slightly. When paying USD350 a night I don't expect to have to pay for wi-fi access (and rarely do in this city). Having asked whether a late check out would be available the price offered for a stay of an extra 3 hours was USD229 + taxes. Given that rooms are still being cleaned at this time I think such requests could be honoured without looking to impose such substantial charges. A request to please pop postcards in the mail with hotel post and add the charge to the bill resulted in directions to the post office - I've never before had a hotel not do this small service for me. These sound like minor gripes but this isn't a cheap hotel and they do impact the overall impression of the service offered. They could be easily addressed though and, if they are, I think the Hyatt would merit a firm rating of 'very good'.","London, United Kingdom",88,3.0

We were combining business and pleasure and were pleased to arrive to a cupcake, wine and balloons in our room for my husband's birthday. A nice touch and not always the norm in NYC. Overall, the Hyatt Union Square feels a bit more boutique and less Hyatt-chain with excellent staff, amenities and a great location earning it a rare 5-star rating from us. The location on 4th Avenue is fantastic. While the rooms are not inexpensive they are a bargain when you consider the proximity to transportation. It's about a 3 minute walk to Union Square station where you can catch a train, up, down, or around the city. I think 7 different lines run through the various Union Square hubs, making it simple to get anywhere in the city. Buy a fare card and go anywhere. If you prefer cabs they are plentiful and easy to hail. Surroundings are safe, well lit, walk-able neighborhood with shops, restaurants, The Strand bookstore (a must visit), and a variety of boutiques. It's an easy walk to the East Village and not too far even to Greenwich Village proper where bars, clubs, and restaurants abound. The location and wonderful staff make this hotel a real find for those wanting to see all parts of the city.We were traveling with our daughter, son-in-law and grandson so we booked 2 rooms: 1 King and 1 Queen Double, both without terraces. The rooms were more ""W"" in style with clean, modern, minimalist furnishings. Very new and chic with no wasted space. Closet space is, as expected, tight with 2 bedside armoire-style closets. Both rooms were clean, comfortable, well stocked and convenient to elevators. Our 6th floor rooms were very quiet--with the exception of our 2.5-year-old grandson's noise--but with virtually no street noise. The beds were typical, high-end Hyatt: firm with nice linens and extra bedding/pillows provided. A work area/desk and reliable Internet connection made it easy to work and play on-line. A well-stocked mini-bar had enough room to store a little milk or juice. Ice must be ordered from room service but was promptly provided. The hotel delivered and set-up a pack 'n play for us, which looked brand new including very nice linens. While they don't advertise, or perhaps even intend to be such, the hotel was very toddler-friendly. Bathrooms had rain shower only (no tub), the water pressure was excellent and hot-water was plentiful. Our only minor issue was that the towel supply seemed to be very limited, perhaps due to the limited rack/shelf space, Again, extra towels were promptly delivered on request. The staff from front-desk to housekeeping were uniformly 5-star! They were all unfailingly helpful, friendly and seeming happy to provide any and every assistance needed. Our stand-out person from this trip was a host, Daquan, who was fantastic with our grandson and a happy, friendly face each day of our stay. His willingness to help locate my bags after I lost my claim ticket went above & beyond! I hope the Hyatt appreciates him, John at the front desk, and the rest of their excellent crew at Union Square! In addition to the hotel itself, we enjoyed the SINGL bar which also has a minimalist, W hotel feel to it. They have a nice whiskey selection, interesting drink menu, good service and ample, comfortable seating. A bit pricey (but what hotel bar isn't?) but a great place to relax with a drink or grab a snack at the end of the day. On Friday evenings they have a jazz quartet which truly enhanced the mellow, relaxing atmosphere. As elsewhere in the hotel, the service exceeded expectations.

The building retains the facade of an earlier old building but the interior has been gutted and all new accommodations built in. Our room was compact but definitely of superior quality with stylish modern decor and quality fittings. Everything was spotless. The check-in area was attentively manned with very helpful and courteous staff who were only too pleased to help with enquiries and queries. The reception area has comfortable seating and free wi-fi. A large bar lounge behind check-in looked very comfortable and was well patronised. We only had one night at the hotel prior to sailing home on Queen Mary 2 and we opted to eat in the restaurant tied to the hotel called The Fourth.

Based on ADA rooms at other hotels, I was hesitant to book one because, in my opinion, they typically aren't as nice as the other rooms in a hotel. At the Hyatt Union Square, we found their ADA rooms to be much nicer than others I have stayed in, and I would not hesitate to stay in one at this hotel again.There was a mix-up with our reservation that we found out about when we arrived. Our reservation for the last night of our stay was inadvertently cancelled by the Hyatt customer service rep, and we didn't know that until check-in. In addition, there were very few Hyatt rooms left in Manhattan for that night, so we were a little anxious about what we were going to do. The next day, William, the front-office manager straightened everything out and honored our previously booked rate at the Hyatt US for that last night, which was a big relief. Thanks, William! Other positives:- The location of the hotel is great. It is a block south of Union Square and the US subway station with multiple lines. Plus, it is easy to walk to many destinations all over Manhattan from the hotel.- There are tons of restaurants and bars to choose from in the area.- The lobby and rooms are very modern in style, clean and look new.- Staff was always friendly and helpful.- Room was amazingly quiet for the middle of NYC. Aside from some noisy guests in the hallway one night, we didn't hear noises through the walls. The windows also seemed great at keeping street noises out up on the 5th floor.- The bed was very comfortable- We actually had a view of the street from our room. Too often in NYC, a hotel window gives a view of a brick wall that is 3 ft away.- Great, rain shower head and water pressure- Nice shampoo, conditioner and soap provided- They offer an “intimacy kit” in the in-room snack/amenities bar. I have never seen that before but thought it was a great idea.Negatives:- Our shower shared a room with the toilet. Because the shower was open, most of the floor in that room got wet during a shower. I am not sure if this layout/design is due to it being an ADA room or not. It wasn't a huge deal, but was a little inconvenient if you wanted to use the toilet after a shower.- The open, modern design of the bathroom doesn't give you much privacy when using the bathroom or showering. This wasn't a big deal for my wife and I, but might be for others. Again, this might have been worse due to the ADA room.- My wife and I both thought that the pillows could have been more comfortable. They flattened out too much overnight for our taste.- Wifi was free for us for some reason (is it always free?) but was very slow.Overall, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and would definitely recommend it to family or friends.","memphis, tn",12,4.0

So these things kept it from getting a top rating but we would try it again. On a side note, If you're tempted by the ""Pie Face"" restaurant across the street, skip it.

I really liked the location - I never stayed in Union Square before. There were a lot of restaurants in the area as well as an amazing café across the street called Think Coffee. We never ate at our hotel restaurant - it seemed overpriced for what they were offering. We went to Think Coffee every morning for great coffee and a heathy unprocessed breakfast. We were close to shopping, Soho, our work location, Chelsea market, the subway (had we wanted to take it), and about 20 minutes walk to the Highline. We found the hotel staff to helpful and friendly including the ever smiling maintenance man, Jesus. The room was not huge, but WHO goes to New York to sit in a hotel room? It was fine and the rooms are soundproofed so you don't hear your neighbours or too much outside noise. We were able to open the window slightly which was great for fresh air. What I liked about the room was that the bed was really comfortable. The rooms were very clean and i am very picky. I like that the toilet (with its own air circulation) and shower were both separate from the sink area which makes getting ready in the morning more efficient. I wish there would have been more of a division between the room and sink besides just the large mirror. I would have liked an additional mirror on the other side of the bathroom mirror and more hooks in the room. I liked that there was a wooden floor and no carpet in the room. What I didn't like about the hotel was the heavy scent of room fragrance all over the hotel. It was a nice scent but too strong and made me nauseous if I sat in the lobby for too long. I didn't like that they charge daily for internet when most hotels include it. I also think they could afford to offer a breakfast buffet included in the price which makes it more convenient in the morning.

The interiors of the lobby, bar and restaurant are all very well done. The artwork above the receptionist desk and bar is an amazing piece and the upholstery selection the lobby area feels warm and inviting. The staff is always attentive and happy to help with whatever you need. The gym of the hotel is well appointed...plenty of cardio equipment and weights. During my stay it was always empty, so you felt that you had a great new modern gym all to yourself. Once inside the rooms, you feel a strong departure from the typical layout, and that is good thing. It is modern, yet inviting and the bed linens are hard to beat. You can tell they actually thought about the guests staying here when they selected all of their finishes. It was done with care and attention to detail.Now the only bad thing is the amount of noise you can hear from your neighbors. The walls seem terribly thin and you can easily hear any conversation that your neighbors are having. Generally not a problem unless you have annoying drunk people coming home at 2am, which I did.For NYC, this is a great hotel...worth a try if you have not and the location is great.","Columbus, Ohio",30,4.0

Enjoyed the Greenmarket and convenience to LES, Greenwich Village and Chelsea.Accommodations - We stayed in an Urbane King Studio and found it a good size plus the open design helped to make it feel even more spacious. I liked the flooring, lighted closet and the lighting system that provided both bright and ambient lighting. Great water pressure in the shower, super comfortable bed with very soft, luxurious linens. We faced 4th Ave. and the room was super quiet with great blackout shades. No problem with the A/C but would recommend running the fan on medium then you never notice the A/C cycling on and off. Staff - always eager to please. A minor delay at check in and we were given a beautiful cheese plate and nice bottle of wine. We were also given a late checkout which was a great convenience. Obviously the hotel will accommodate you when they can without those unnecessary surcharges.Areas to improve - it took three nights until they got turndown service correct ... Not just the bedding pulled back but also fresh towels, wastebaskets emptied and room tidied. So housekeeping needs to work on this but in other areas, they excel. I never saw the hallways cluttered or littered and the rooms are super clean.Not having wifi was ok - I never expect it in higher end hotels but bottled water in the room would be a nice addition. I just got used to grabbing an extra bottle from the well equipped exercise room.I would definitely stay here again.",minneapolis,22,4.0

We hurriedly booked anything we could find online which was the Hyatt Union Square. It is fairly new and relatively hard for the experienced taxi driver to find although it has a very prominent corner across Union Square, it is in a very sterile business area, a block or so from the boring Union Square Park, where not only smoking is not allowed; but also no animals, which are usually more exciting than the people in the park! The hotel itself -- run by the LGBT community (which you'd think would give it some ""wow"" factor or flair, or excitement) -- takes on the same boring, sterile atmosphere as the Park. It attempts, but misses, to be a high end luxury hotel as the other SPG property -- the W, a long standing 5-star boutique hotel several blocks away direct facing the Square. What is does succeed in doing -- even in its infancy -- is duplicating the W's rates. For three nights, even considering the Labor Day weekend, we paid $1,500 -- averaging $500 p/n! Soo not worth it -- even in New York! The king size bed was too hard and not to my liking. Listen, I'm not saying the hotel is bad, it's not. It is modern, trendy (just not my kind of trend) and new. The staff is young but responsive and the rooms are small but well-appointed (although the ""garden view"" leaves a lot to be desired -- especially from the 9th floor). I am saying that the Hyatt Union Square NY is not ready for prime time and prime time rates -- it has a ways to go! I have and most likely will pay Hyatt Union Square NY rates for a comfortable, luxury stay in New York hotels, but there are too many other hotel choices to choose from and the Hyatt Union Square NY will not be one of them.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",1,3.0

Crisp modern design. We had the urban terrace rooms which are great - the bedroom is petite, but the terraces are big and so long as the weather is OK, you have a suite with an open air lounge. My room was at the corner, slightly larger and had the largest terrace, so we had a little drinks party on it with friends from Brooklyn and others! Seating for eight. I can't think of anything else with this at the price. The more standard rooms must be.........more standard. Young laid back staff extremely polite and helpful. I cannot fault them - they're a real credit to the hotel. Couple of small gripes. As is so common, there was not a bright enough light in the room. Reading after dark was too challenging for me, and my sight is not that bad. Vanity light over the mirror too small, and hard to see to shave. No shaving mirror. A sink the depth of a dinner plate which holds about 10mm depth of water (and even that drains with the plug in) does not help. Style over function. Hardly a deal breaker.What could be is the aircon. Early reviews complain that it simply wasn't powerful enough. We had no such issue, so I wonder if they've ""turned it up""? If so, the price to pay is that it is way too noisy. All 3 of us had to turn it off, as it's like a truck starting and stopping next to your bed and very difficult to sleep through. It would be a costly issue to fix, but it's what stops this being a perfect hotel. It's why I've given a 2 for sleep quality - the beds themselves are very comfy.We had half an hour to wait for our car Sat brunchtime so we wandered in to the cafe/bar for a drink, where there was obvious friction between the staff and the atmosphere not nice. They were all very stressed. Big contrast with the hotel itself.All things considered I will definitely stay here again. It has a nice vibe - between staid mid-town and LES party.

However there was a bathroom window into the room (not to the outside). The annoying part part about that is that when using the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light shines into the bedroom, thereby waking up your spouse.

The overnight staff handled it extremely poorly and because it was a busy night in Manhattan, couldn't find me another room on the island.The staff, while friendly, generally seems young and inexperienced. One morning, after delivering the wrong newspaper, the woman delivering them complained to me that, at 8:30, it was too early to be working. She was trying to be friendly, but clearly hasn't been trained on guest interaction.The bar area, while lovely, isn't staffed up enough - we had to get up and ask for our bar tab each night because nobody ever came back.The breakfast room service menu is odd - needs more simpler choices.My colleague had a number of issues with the service in the restaurant - I never tried it.The Good:Great location near Union Square.As others have mentioned, a boutique addition to the Hyatt properties in Manhattan. Much cooler vibe.William, the front desk manager, took care of my oversold situation the next day and provided excellent service all week.The bed is ridiculously comfortable. Shower is great, too.Corner rooms (upgrade) have a sitting area and a bit more space than the standard rooms.Overall, while I was incredibly frustrated by my first impression (being bumped and how poorly it was handled), the hotel did make it up to me and this will likely become my business home in Manhattan.","Silver Spring, Maryland",66,3.0

Very nice bar in lobby to grab a drink. I loved the hard wood floors in the room, sheets were nice and room was functional.

Sink is not deep, expect flooding. Bathroom toilet could use some more elbow space. A lot of the switches have neon lights that glow in the dark bright, so you never really get a fully dark room to sleep in, also the fiber cables behind the TV flicker on/off all night disrupting the already lack of darkness in the room at night. The air conditioner is horrible, never cold enough, kept on cicking on/off every 3 minutes, very loud, actually the street noise didnt bother me, but the AC is a no win.

The hotel has some room for improvement. I had some good & weak points to mention, so I'll break down my review into pros/cons:Pros:- Alyssa at check in was amazing! She was very kind, gave me a lovely upgrade (room #901) & was cool, yet refined. Well done & thank you! - Meagan from In Room Dining who delivered my breakfast was super- warm, efficient & very kind! The young guy who delivered my dinner was also really lovely- both were so nice! - The shower is absolutely amazing! Perfect water pressure & very clean. - The CO Bigelow bath products were lovely- I love the Lavender Peppermint scent...perfect for the summer. - The location in Union Square is amazing- a very hip, cool neighborhood in downtown NYC. Near some amazing restaurants, lively street life, Whole Foods, Think Coffee, Union Sq park, etc. - The lobby had a lovely smell & was very aesthetically pleasing. Cons:-Extremely Limited Room Service Menu- it's provided by the hotels restaurant, The Fourth, but the selection offered is very strange & not ideal for guests who are looking for more simple dining options for in room dining. - The girl who checked me out on the morning of 7/5 was not very friendly at all. She hardly made eye contact, never asked me how my stay was, never offered assistance with luggage, & was borderline uninterested in her job. This was a Fail on all levels. - The bed, while comfy, was way too heavy for the summer. A lighter comforter would have been really nice, but it was so late. - My room was extremely bright, which would have been fine. However, it was extremely hot + humid outside & my room was very small, which was not ideal- I think this contributed to the room always feeling warm. - The A/C was cool, but could have been much colder. I honestly felt like my room never was cold enough for me- just a personal preference. Overall, if you want to stay in this part of New York, I think the hotel is an ideal choice. I think the W in Union Square is much better in terms of service, dining & is similar in price. I'm a fan of both Park Hyatt & Andaz, both under the Hyatt group. This was a bit of a let down, but I'm still happy I tried the hotel. In no way did I have a bad stay, just wanted to give some honest feedback. Best,Patrick Winkler","New York City, New York",58,3.0

We got a nice surprise: an upgrade to a king room, outside facing on the 5th floor, at the end of the hall. Quiet actually (other than thin walls - you can hear the anyone's shower from the hallway), but then again traffic at this part of Union Square is more like DC vs. NYC. The decor & design were clever & soothing, & maybe most importantly made efficient use of space in the traditional small footprint of a hotel in NYC. Examples: Pocket doors between the sleeping area & the bathroom, the bathroom & the toilet; the mini bar console was an oval design that fit well close to the entry, without having hard edges that would've clashed with the space. Loved the green cooling system (turns on only when you're in the room) & light controls. The plastic molded wall with the wavy design made the room seem less closet like too. The onsite gym was pretty BIG compared to what I've seen at larger hotels. The roof top terrace was scenic enough but kind of boring & not a ""scene"" really, sans bar or hot tub. I'd highly recommend the bar, Singl: GREAT cocktails, sharp service, wine selection may seem limited but is carefully thought-out. Extensive scotch & whisky selection. We didn't eat in the restaurant, which seemed would definitely rival something at say a Kimpton, but we did get excellent bar & dinner fare at Singl (very boutique-y). Service was low key, friendly, & efficient. Our porter honestly advised us we'd probably pay less at the public parking garage across the street (we did - $50 for overnight vs. $60 with the hotel). We were lucky - no sour notes, but that apparently wasn't the case with some other guests we overheard at checkout. The main areas for improvement might be a) a different configuration for the front desk to allow for more privacy, b) free WiFi throughout (free only in the lobby, seriously?!), & something to spice up the roof top terrace. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.","Baltimore, Maryland",3,5.0

In my book this won the best Hotel in NYC, and let me tell you why.First the location. It's located one block away from Union Square, which is a major subway/metro station connecting to almost everywhere in NY. You're basically one or two metro stations away from anywhere in New York, avoiding the chaos and the tourists in Times Square and Mid-town. In Union Square itself you have the Whole foods, where we used to grab breakfast (they have fresh breakfast buffet at 7:30AM), take the metro and eat it in Central Park...it just starts the day perfectly! You also have a drug store, Starbuck, movie theater, shops, coffee shops, Eataly (amazing Italian market). Hyatt Union Square is the perfect addition in the neighborhood and is way more conveniant than anywhere else!We entered the hotel, we were amazed how beautiful and clean it was...just like the rooms....it's not just clean...it's ''OCD'' type of clean! The lobby looks great, like the decor, the lounge was closed (it opens at 4PM) but just looking at it made us want to hang out and have a drink or two. The staff upon our arrival was smiling, great attitude, we felt very welcome and for once in New York they made us feel like we are very important for them. Trust me I had a lot of requests and quesions and they made absolutely everything possible to accomodate me and even go the extra mile! Nowhere in New York I ever experienced this level of service....ever!...not even in the classic 5 star luxury hotels....where they make you feel like they are doing you a favor.....but that's for another review. While they were making sure everything in the room was all set (again I had a few request prior our arrival which I arranged with Jeremy the concierge who was also fantastic by the way), we decided to go have a few drinks at the Fourth, so we sat at the bar (the Singl lounge was closed...we were early for check-in) and realized that the bartender was speaking fluent french...she was absolutely amazing, she helped us and guided us with our itinerary and a few tips for our stay over the long week-end. She also (on her own initiative) provided information and backgroud on all the arts and designs from the Fourth. Once you understand the artist more...it makes a lot of sense! Great start to our journey!Now the room....it was HUGE! (about 567 sf) It was clean (as I mentionned earlier) it smelled great and I had everything I asked for in the room including a little treat from the Hotel itself....a nice little attention which was very much appreciated! We stayed in the Empyreal Suite, amazing decor, you walk in the dining room, then the living room, you also have a connecting bathroom with the bedroom and the washroom which is also enormous! They use every little bit of space brillantly, the design is not comparable to anything, it's very fresh, very modern and hip....and it also smelled great in the room! You have control pannels everywhere in the room which controls the lights (master, different moods and ambiance) the temperature and also the sheers and curtains....everything is electrical and automatic...it's great! There is windows (floor to ceiling) everywhere, plenty of natural lights at all time. And the bed...OMG...so comfortable! You will fall asleep without even noticing it! There are plenty of space in the room...two very large closets where you can hang your clothing and also drawers and cabinets to put everything away...even two large suitacases!The bathroom is huge, two sinks with mirrors so we can use it at the same time, the toilet is also isolated from the bathroom. The shower?? We can fit a football team in there! We always took our shower together...felt like we were in a luxury locker room! :PThe gym is also huge....this is the best gym I ever went to in any hotel, you have top of the line equipment (and a LARGE variety of it), cold fresh towels in a fridge with fruits and water available. Too bad we didn't have time to use it! The rooftop terrace is also quite large, there is room for 20-25 people to sit comfortably, different tables, chairs, beds...etc. However they have no alcohol licence for the rooftop so no bar and you're not allowed bringing alcohol either...but it's ok.The only thing is there is no fridge in the room to keep cold beverages for when we get back to the only after walking all day. There is also no ice machine, you have to call in-room service to order some. But the good news is I never had to ask for it, after my first call upon my arrival, they made sure I had Ice everyday and they put the champagne in a bucket ready for our arrival every single day! They scored major points with that too!They have the turndown service, they prepare the room for the night with lights / sheers / curtains setting, and a little treat everyday on the bed. We liked that a lot.Last thing, the price....VERY reasonnable, I noticed that they lowered the price by 100$/night on all room category about a month before we arrived, which made us decide to upgrade. With the price reduction.....it's cheaper than other hotels and you get a LOT more!I will also post pictures to give you a better idea, but thanks again to all Hyatt people, I don't remember all of the names but you all contributed to an amazing week-end in New York and you have us now...we'll get back every year!Thank you so much, Francois Morin","Montreal, Canada",1,5.0

First thing you notice is that the location to UNION Square is like a block or so. It’s like a 7 minute walk to Whole FOODS and a 2 minute walk to a Hipster Coffee Bar called ""Think Coffee"". As we first walked in we were greeted by 2 people in the front and felt very welcomed immediately. We walked in and loved the lobby, it is nearby a restaurant next door in which you can see a huge wood piece of art hanging on the roof going down 15 feet. I don’t know what the heck it was, look liked a bunch of wooden chairs, but wow!!When walking into our studio room, we noticed that it had glass sliding doors leading into a patio area with plants and ivy. Place is so warm and makes you want to stay in the hotel room. Usually you feel like you’re in a hotel, UNION SQUARE HYATT felt as if your home. I noticed by walking around the hotel there was a lot of YOUNG (25-33) diverse faces working on the staff. All staff was clean cut and had college degrees. Many types of faces which include an Asian, Hispanic, African American, and white. The best of the crop of each ethnic background, not gritty people. Usually at hotels you see old people hustling for tips. I feel bad saying it, but this hotel felt like it had more energy than the old Grand Hyatt. The rooms were beautiful and really used up the space wisely. There was a comfortable HYATT queen bed with the HYATT linens. HYATT gear for sleeping is very high quality! The shower had exquisite oval tile, looked incredible! I was really surprised to see how small the room was but yet it was so comforting. Like previously noted, ""I FELT like it was home"". The gym was just small and perfect, it’s also 24 hours!!! It was empty when I went at around 930 ish, the only people I saw were people going in to get the complimentary water bottles in the refrigerator. The gym has a bench , some dumbbells, cardio machines (With the tv screens/internet), couple of yoga mats, etc. Just enough to get a great workout in. They also offer complimentary towels. You really do not have to leave the hotel for anything. At the end, I was quite sad for leaving. But will return….

We celebrated our anniversary there and stayed three nights. The hotel's location, just below Union Square on Fourth Avenue at 13th St. is very convenient for all types of activities because it is just on the edge of the East Village, close to the West Village, on Union Square, and has easy access to lower Manhattan, midtown, and the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn via subway.We enjoyed the relaxed, but very comfortable, atmosphere at the hotel. Its not like any Hyatt you've been to before - it gives the feeling of a trendy, independent hotel. The staff is very pleasant and friendly, and although the rooms are small, they are well-decorated, functional, and relaxing. The front desk staff don't wear traditional uniforms and the front desk - well its not really a front desk. I think Hyatt has learned a lot from their Hyatt Place experiences, with a less formal approach to registration and check in. This hotel works well, but it feels more personal and friendly than other Hyatt's I've stayed in.I usually stay in midtown hotels when in NYC, but I liked this stay and I think I will be here when I have the opportunity. I liked being near the restaurants of the Village, with quick access to Chinatown, SOHO and the lower east side.

We received rooms 310 and 309, which were slightly noisy but not too bad. The rooms were pretty nice, although very small and the bathroom would be uncomfortable for people sharing a room other than significant others. In one of the rooms, the Air Conditioning didn't seem to work 100%. The bathrooms have nice toiletries - C.O. Bigelow. The TVs are nice and have HD channels - always a plus. We didn't try it but the gym looked nice. The location was very convenient to the subway and restaurants and shops. The restaurant for breakfast was pretty good, but expensive and one of the orders came out wrong (but it was still good). Service was friendly but simple tasks like getting luggage up to the room and calling when the rooms were available were made difficult. One last note - the mini fridge diet pepsi was slightly expired and warm, usually okay but it stunk considering it was $5 for 8 ounces. The hotel was overall nice and after a few more months of operation, it will probably be great, albeit slightly form over function-y.","Washington, D.C.",38,4.0

I wish I could give 3.5 stars, but am giving 4 fully expecting that once the kinks are ironed out, this will be an exceptional property for the location (i.e. the rooms are tiny).The first thing I have to comment on is the exceptionally kind and helpful staff. From the front desk, to the valet, to the guest services line, everyone was incredibly accommodating. One evening I called down asking for a can opener and the woman who answered thought I said kennel - yes like a kennel for my French bulldog - and said she didn't know if they had any but would see if she could locate one I could borrow. Hilarious, but I never would have known that's what happened if I didn't call back half an hour later requesting the can opener. It does say that she was really interested in helping me!Also I guess because my husband is a Diamond member, for 2 nights there was either a fruit platter with a half bottle of chianti, or a cheese plate with a half bottle of chianti - a nice bottle too - Ruffino. We are wine lovers and this was really a nice touch.The location is excellent. Having gone to NYU I love the neighborhood and it is easy to get to any part of town via the subway at Union Square. Great coffee and breakfast in the adjacent restaurant and/or across the street.What needs a little work: although we had the lovely food & wine amenity, there seemed to be lack of knowledge of Hyatt Gold Passport amenities. My husband is a Diamond member and is entitled to a number of benefits for his 50+ nights a year at Hyatt. A room upgrade, complimentary bottled water in room, complimentary breakfast if there is no club lounge (there isn't), complimentary wifi, guaranteed bed type requested, late checkout.We requested a King bed, but the website is a little slippery on this one claiming you get the ""Hyatt Grand Bed"" - doesn't say what size, but ours was a queen sized bed. We were not offered an upgrade and I basically had to argue with guest services at the front desk to get one for our last night (we got a lovely patio which was great with our pup and to sit outside and enjoy the wine, but the room was still tiny). I was told they were sold out of upgraded rooms, but when I looked at the online booking system that did not seem to be the case. What really bothered me though because it's an easy way for them to score points with Diamond guests, was not being offered the complimentary breakfast and wifi. I had to ask for the breakfast and assumed the wifi would be removed from the bill when I asked - kudos that I didn't have to ask at checkout. Again compliments to the staff on being proactive after I complained about not having our Diamond benefits offered to us upon check-in.Also the rooms are VERY small although I will say they did their best to maximize the use of the space and the Bigelow toiletries were a nice touch. In the mini-bar is a fridge on one side with drinks and a coffee pot on the other.Sometimes it took several calls to get someone on the phone for requests, the docking station is for iPhone 4 with no adapter for Iphone 5 (again this is where the staff excels - the manager let me borrow his charger). Like I said - the staff is what makes this property worth the stay...that and the location. My husband prefers the Andaz because we get bigger rooms, but one has to remember that this hotel has fewer than 200 rooms to begin with and did the best they could with the space constraints.Overall I agree with other reviewers that it's a nice addition to the Hyatt brand in NYC. If you can deal with the limited space for a few days, go for it. If it were just me and not two people, I would definitely stay again.","San Francisco, California",58,4.0

Good location near Union Square. Staff still seems relatively new. When we drove up there were no valet attendants or anyone else on staff outside. We ended up going inside and they had to call someone to grab the car. Staff at check-in was very nice. Hotel seems to be trying to be very trendy. We had a room on the second floor with a terrace.

I was in Manhatten to pick up my daughter from NYU. The location was great for me as it was only one block away from her dorm. The staff is very friendly and helpful. A few kinks still need to be worked out but overall it was a great experience. I was in a Business Plan room which was very comfortable. The bathroom was large enough and had a shelf for any items you wished to store in there. There was a coffee maker in the same cabinet that the minibar was located . A nice touch was the treats left each night on the bed at turndown. My only real complaint was housekeeping knocking on my door at 8:30 am on check out day.

I was upgraded to an eighth floor room with a terrific view to the street. The window could be partially opened, a plus, and when closed was soundproof. The room was a spotless as one would excpect in a new hotel, and the positioning of its features, and the contrasts of light and dark materials, made a good-sized room feel larger. The flowing white console surrounding the TV and incorporating the desk was an unusual feature that I felt worked with the generally modern design of the room. Loved the oval free-standing mini bar--visually, best design I've seen in a while, although placement of the coffee maker made filling the water in the machine a slight challenge. The yellow accessories on the white sink in the bath were pleasing to look at, the rainshower had excellent pressure, and the oval tiles in the shower stall were visually attractive. The room's dark wood floors were another attractive feature, and the discretion of a separate water closet is always appreciated.The young, pleasant staff were helpful with various questions and needs. The fitness center in the basement is very well equipped, although the music volume was a little too intrusive into what I was listening to on my headphones. The hotel's location is terrific for anyone wishing to stay downtown, yet with easy access to midtown and beyond. Union Square and all it offers is a block away, and walking into the Village, Noho, Soho and elsewhere couldn't be easier. It's also great to find a hotel with a roof terrace--I took my computer up there one morning to do some work. The only obstacle to a fifth star for this review was the loud air-conditioning unit in the room--this could use some attention.",Boston,13,4.0

First off - this is a terrific location, just a block off of Union Square, and in the midst of Village and away from Tourist New York. The King View Room was small, but well appointed, with a full size shower and great water pressure. The rest of the bath area is tight, but it's hard to get a full size bath into a small room and expect to have anything left for the bed area. The hotel is so new that the towels have not been laundered enough, and still have that new towel feel and inability to absorb water. No much of a closet, but again - hard to do in a small space. Coffee maker and mini bar hidden away in a free standing table/bar. There was a large flat screen TV mounted on an curved acrylic wall unit which seemed out of place for the room. Internet access was free due my Hyatt status, but it's still that annoying business of charging a fee for access when you're paying over $400/night for a room. The air conditioning was very loud, even when on Lo, and the airflow so forceful that the curtains on the other side of the room billowed as if on a clothes line in a stiff breeze. At least one room on my floor had not yet been completed, so some construction noise was noticeable.The restaurant was not yet fully operational, so services and service were a bit disjointed, but in time I'm sure that will work out.Everyone I interacted with was friendly and ready to handle whatever question or request I had.

Front desk manager Cheryl Huse has assembled a fine cast, the rooms are NYC small but very smart, and the restaurant is first rate. The Fourth, which opened to Friends and Family only so far--is excellent: the beet salad and salmon were both delectable at dinner and coffee at breakfast makes my top ten list.
