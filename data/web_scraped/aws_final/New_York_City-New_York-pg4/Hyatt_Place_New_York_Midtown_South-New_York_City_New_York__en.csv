When another party checked out we presumed they could put case in this room and both check out at 2.30 pm to airport. But on checking my room was ok to stay in, the reception staff gave a whopping lie and said no, you booked to swop into a King size room! Who would book 4 nights in one style of room then change on last night! Clearly they had over booked and required it for a family! Instead of asking nicely, they demanded I hand room back. When I said well give me the other room, all of a sudden they couldn’t check me in until 3pm!!!!! They knew I was leaving at 2.30 it was now 10am! They then said they would charge me to remain in room! So not only did they get use of the free room to re-sell they threw us out! I witnessed people arriving late afternoon being told there rooms were not ready! Why? Because they are happy to charge people to extend but keep you waiting to check in! The blankets for beds had holes in! All very shabby! The staff are unhelpful, obviously on bonuses so they are money orientated to charge for everything!

There wasn’t particularly a great choice at brekkie, bacon, waffles or pancakes, the fruit looked good but I didn’t try it. However the coffee bar was great with a good selection of coffees and teas.

Booked the hotel for my 5th wedding anniversary, and was disappointed to learn the hotel was under renovation. That wasn't particularly a problem, but it would have been courteous to inform paying guests prior to arrival, especially given my stay was 8 days.What compounded that, was I learnt all guests received complimentary breakfasts owing to the renovation. I'd already paid for breakfast, so had paid extra for no reason. Furthermore, it meant the breakfast lounge, which is already ridiculously small, was impossible to obtain a seat in. This meant on a few occasions, either hanging around, taking a plate outside, or attempting to get the lift upstairs (5 minute wait), by which point the food was unbearably cold and pointless. So I had paid for breakfast but couldn't get a seat, and people who had complimentary breakfasts were over the moon. One of the managers said this was normal, with a big smile on his face. I was witness to at least 2 other guests absolutely lose it - they had families and were told to load up a tray and take it back upstairs.Lift situation is a joke - 2 lifts and a hotel full of people. We ended up walking up and down 14 flights because we waited over 10 minutes and still couldnt get a lift.The standard of the breakfast was worse than I could have imagined. The eggs were not eggs - they were absolutely some form of powdered variety. The hot options abysmal. Cold options not much better, absolutely loaded with sugar. The manager assured me he would rectify the fact I had paid for breakfast and adjust the rate I paid. He lied. Upon checkout, he had done nothing, and I was left to argue with the reception manager, who also tried to lie to me and insist there was no complementary breakfast - I caught her out and she backtracked. Rooms were fine - relatively clean except for a few dusty spots & dirt behind the sofas and in the corners. No minibar.I was encouraged to sign up to the Hyatt World membership on arrival. Essentially a pointless membership which I will be cancelling. Supposed to be complimentary breakfast included, but as alluded to I'd already purchased breakfast in my package, and they didn't offer to adjust this. The only benefit we received was complimentary water, which we couldn't get for 3 of the 8 days, as the renovations were occurring and the confused people at the desk didn't know how to navigate that massive obstacle of finding a few bottles.",coventry,0,1.0

We stayed on the 5th floor. Obviously, New York is expensive but I do feel that the price for the room was reasonable (compared to others) given its fantastic location. The subway station is just a 5 minute walk away (although it is the hottest subway station we encountered!). Many of the main sights are also within walking distance including the Empire State Building, Macy's, Madison Square Garden (7-10 minute walk) as well as Times Square, The Rockefeller Centre, Bryant Park, Central Library, Central Station, Chrysler Building (15-20 minute walk) plus much more. However, I would highly recommend getting a 7 day subway pass if you are there for almost a week. It is $33 and really easy to use and you can use it on any of the subway lines, we definitely got value for money and it means you can be a bit lazy if you're feeling tired and just travel one stop without worrying about cost.The room was cleaned daily and we didn't have any issues with the room. It was a very standard room with air-con, a fridge and a king size bed but there is so much to see in NY you won't spend much time in your room. Even when we were tired on some afternoons we would take our own drinks up to the roof terrace and relax up there, it is a really nice space with great views of the Empire State Building. The only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars was because of breakfast. We found that there were often not enough staff on at breakfast so tables wouldn't be cleaned very fast and the food wasn't always topped up if it had ran out so you ended up missing out. We would often have to sit at a table covered in crumbs or with dirty plates and bowls still on them with no sign of a member of staff ready to clean them. My other issue about breakfast is that it is only served until 9am downstairs which seems really early, I know it is served on the terrace until 10am but sometimes it was too windy to sit on the terrace, we did this once and everything was blowing everywhere. The food served at breakfast is nice and we never had any problems with the food itself, there is a choice of hot food, toast, bagels, doughnuts, yoghurt and lots of nice fresh fruit as well as juices and hot drinks.The lobby area is currently under construction but this didn't impact us on our trip.I would stay here again because of the location but I hope breakfast time is improved.",,22,4.0

Full stop. The thing is, our expectations aren’t high being used to London and it’s outlandish price/quality ratio. But the Hyatt Place Mid-town appears to defy the odds. We have been in touch with the hotel via Twitter (DM) but that didn’t trouble the hotel as no one approached us to discuss. So what’s the snag? Essentially, the breakfast room setup is worst what we have seen and we travel a lot both on business and privately. For disclosure, I lived in a Hyatt hotel for three month and no issues. So (a) I believe I have been loyal to Hyatt and (b) with a family one does take convenience discounts into account (although should one, really?). Regardless, the breakfast room is too small/narrow and overall not fit for purpose. We could barely move (chairs back to back and no room to pass! - see picture) and as family of five could not sit together, once. On one day, we had to split up into three tables. Given the inadequate space, it brings the worst out in people with unfortunate scenes at the buffet bar. Equally, no staff appears to be present to clear away plates and it became all a bit of youth hostel feel to it all. Despite having Explorist Status no offer of room upgrade, nor any service offer that generally comes with Hyatt frequent user status. Shocking how Hyatt Place is, IMHO, a very poor brand ambassador for Hyatt. In a single word: AWFUL.",London,4,2.0

April 2019 . 2 adults and 2 kids , aged 7 and 10 . We had a room on the 5th floor , good size room , loads of space for New York Standards , had a big double bed and a big sofa bed for the children . Had no view what so ever , but no noise either . Beds were very comfortable and we all slept perfectly well . Also the 5th floor was quite handy , it’s not too high to walk up and down . Since there are only 2 lifts , they can get really busy . Check in was all fine and quick and everyone friendly and helpful . Breakfast was fab , it had everything we needed , a really big choice . Had a selection of fresh fruits and yoghurts , juices , eggs / bacon / sausages , cereals and porridge , big variety of breads / banana breads and bagels , tea and coffee . The only thing I would say , go early if you can , on our check out day we went around 9am and had to queue for a table and it was absolutely mobbed and felt a bit manic. The other days we went between 6.30 and 7.30 and it felt a lot more civilised and calmer . What we really appreciated is that you get free tea and coffee and water for free 24 hrs . It’s really handy with the kids , can top up water bottles before you head out . The only thing I would say , there was 4 of us in the room , but every day we only had 2 big towels in the bathroom . But as soon as we asked for more we got them straight away . The location is absolutely amazing . 2 walking minutes away you have got 34th Street herald square subway station , you can also walk to broadway , Times Square , Empire State Building , flat iron building , 230th roof top bar . One day we even walked back from Central Park . Also the rooftop deck is very beautiful and has an amazing Empire State view . The rooms are a bit dated , but it was all clean and tidy and the staff were always friendly and helpful . On arrival day we took a cab from JFK , on way back we took the subway from Penn station . If you have not that many bags it’s super easy , roughly 10 walking minutes from the hotel ( 8 dollars per person including the air train ) . We had a lovely stay and would definitely recommend the Hyatt place . ",,10,4.0

It was a quick, work oriented trip. The Hyatt Place is very down to earth, comfortable and just enough of a luxurious a hotel to make you feel like you're in the heart of New York, but still be able to breeze through the door to see the night staff having fun with each other while cleaning up from another day in the city. The rooms are comfortable, the water is hot, and the beds are firm. I had a view of the Empire State Building from my room.

My only complaint is the TV wasn't working for one evening, seemed to be a problem throughout the hotel, not just my room. And, the elevators were small and slow, almost too crowded each morning to get on the first time around, sometimes had to wait for next elevator.

Rooms are smaller than most Hyatt Place locations (I have stayed in at least half a dozen) but more than sufficient and quite large for Manhattan.Location is great, on a fairly quiet street but a quick stroll to Broadway, Time Square, etc.The hotel does not have its own parking but has an arrangement with a garage down the block. $49 a night at the front desk which is a little below average for the area and cheaper than if you had just payed the parking charge at the garage itself.Breakfast was the typical Hyatt Place spread which fills you up but doesn't excite you. I did not find it crowded at all but I am an early riser and got there when it opened at 6:30. I also had no problem with waits for the elevators as others have written but I suspect Sunday night is a fairly low-occupancy time for them.The only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that you cannot take care of the parking when you check in, they will only validate and charge it upon checkout. The reason I don't like this is that I usually check out via the Hyatt app and don't need to go to the front desk but at least when I checked out there was no line and the desk attendant was very friendly.One piece of advice -- keep checking prices even after you have booked. A few weeks after I made my reservation I noticed that the price for the same evening had come down by $30 so I cancelled and rebooked.

We do have one complaint, our bags that we checked, for a very reasonable 3 dollars per bag, were found by my daughter sitting in the buffet/dining area unattended, in a clearly non secure location. She went back to use the restroom and found them sitting there. The staff were going in and out of the storage area getting other bags. So it is not clear why our bags were sitting unattended. Hence the non excellent review. The front desk was understaffed, however it was Christmas weekend, so somewhat understandable. We waited about 30 minutes to address our concern, and that we took our bags, but left because the line was so long. ","State College, Pennsylvania",0,3.0

Before our trip, I emailed Hyatt requesting two rooms at the top of the hotel facing the Empire State building. The response I received back seemed to indicate this wouldn't be a problem, however upon arrival we didn't receive this request which was quite disappointing. The hotel is in a good location and is within walking distance from a lot of the tourist attractions. However, even though the hotel is in a good location, the street is quite noisy. We stayed on the 14th floor roadside and we could hear the traffic all night even though we were quite high up. Our room was a good size and the bed was very comfy but there was definitely room for improvement. We had no wardrobe door and no mirror in the room, only a mirror in the bathroom which was a pain trying to get ready in the morning entirely in the bathroom. The bathroom floor was also quite cold so I would recommend taking some slippers. We also had a temperamental TV and some days it was so frustrating we didn't even bother to turn it on.The hotel breakfast was excellent and the hot food changed every day. The breakfast room was sometimes quite busy but we always managed to find a table. The lobby also has free coffee, tea and flavoured water which is a nice touch. When we checked in, we were also told we were eligible for two free bottles of water a day. However, on our last day my parents were told they weren't actually eligible for the water even though they had been given it for the past few days so this was a bit frustrating. There are also only two lifts in the hotel so you can be waiting a while for one. Make sure you go to the roof terrace on the top floor, it has a good view of the Empire State building. Overall, the hotel has it's good points but definitely needs to improve in some areas. Even though the breakfast was great, I wouldn't stay here again.","Gillingham, United Kingdom",12,3.0

The room allocated was clean, modern fittings, a large and comfy bed and a good shower. The location is perfect for easy travelling around the city and very close to The Empire State BuildingThe room had a full sofa and footrest which dominated the space, a single chair and footrest would suit the standard rooms better in my opinion, allowing more space.Whilst accepting the building struggles for floorspace on each level, the breakfast room/bar is cramped and way too busy at peak times to enjoy a leisurely breakfast. To be fair, the hotel does advise of likely waiting times.Unfortunately the stark lighting in the room without windows does not help either.Not an easy solution to this, accepted, but judging by the reaction of fellow guests, our opinion was shared.The breakfast offer itself is exactly as expected and described for the hotel classification but plastic everything in terms of crockery, cutlery and glassware cheapens the brand, in my view.Despite that area of criticism it’s a decent budget hotel and if a good location, bed and shower are the priorities on your agenda, it fits the bill perfectly.","Derbyshire, United Kingdom",4,3.0

Our room had a large tv and fridge and safe, 2 seater couch and all other items you expect from a hotel. The en suite was clean and spacious. We had a rear facing room so no view except onto ac units of other buildings but we were not in the room for a view. We were out and about for that! 6 minute walk to the Empire State building and 10 minutes to Times Square. The buffet breakfast was all you could ask for....Cereals & porridge, yogurts & fruit, breads & muffins, tea/coffee and selection of juices , scrambled eggs daily with a different hot food each day ..sausages or bacon or potatoes etc. This was self service and plentiful. There was a 24 hour food menu reasonably priced and snack food available to buy at reception but we ate out during the day. The computer in reception with use of the printer was free to use and very useful to print our boarding passes. Free wifi in bedroom was excellent.

Hence the 3/5.Firstly the price is fine, given the location it is expected to pay $250+ for a room. In any other city I would say this isn't value for money but this is Midtown NYC so it is expected.In terms of location, you can't ask for better. The ESB is right around the corner, and there is a perfect view from the 26th floor balcony. One more than one occasion we bought lunch nearby and ate on the balcony just to enjoy the view. The staff there are very friendly and helpful. We were visiting for a special occasion and were treated to a small red wine and fruit bowl from the management team which was a lovely gesture!There are negatives however. Firstly from reviews I read it appeared that staying on a higher floor will reduce the sound of the outside noise. We were on the 21st floor and heard everything! They must have to look into more adequate sound proofing as the lack of a good night sleep was annoying. Also the mini-fridge in the room made a lot of noise too - so I plugged it out for the trip for some peace.Maybe a 3 is harsh as there are some positives, however all I use a room for is sleeping and when you are unable to get a good night sleep because of the noise outside it deters from the experience.","Walsall, England",38,3.0

On our return at 3pm (check in time), the room was still not ready so we waited a short time in the reception. When our room was allocated, we had paid for a room with a view but we decided that a room on a lower floor would be better for us and therefore, we opted for a different (cheaper) room. Although we had paid for a better room, we accepted that this was our choice and we did not give the fact that we had down graded a second thought. The staff at check-in were very helpful and polite.The room was absolutely fine and the breakfast was good with a range of choices. The best thing about the Hyatt was the terrace on the 26th floor, the hotel should consider doing more in this area i.e. more comfortable seating - it's a great space!We stayed in the Hyatt for 4 nights. Unfortunately, our experience was spoilt at the check-out stage. When we requested to leave our bags until we were due to leave NY at 3pm, we were told that there was a $3 charge per bag. As we are a family of 5 with hold and cabin bags each, this added up and was an unexpected expense - this fee does not apply on arrival. I told the receptionist that this was something that I had not experienced before (despite staying in hotels in many major cities) and the response was 'it's hotel policy, nothing to do with me.' Reluctantly, we had to agree to this basically, we had little choice. Stickers were attached to the bags and we were given a receipt. At this point, I made the receptionist aware that it seemed very out of balance that when we arrived to check-in at 3pm, the room had not been ready (which we did not make a fuss about) and we had opted for a lower grade room for our 4 night stay (yes, our choice but this was advantageous to the hotel as we'd paid for one of the higher priced rooms which was then available for other guests). The receptionist looked at me, rolled her eyes and continued to do what she was doing at the desk. There was absolutely no verbal response. Given the fact that there are a few trip advisor reviews that negatively comment on this $3 bag charge, I suspect this issue comes up with some regularity so plenty of opportunity for staff to develop a response more appropriate than rolling the eyes and ignoring the guest when they speak. I have contacted Hyatt directly about our poor check-out experience and given the name of this member of staff.Last but not least, it is important for other potential guests/guests to be aware that the baggage store is essentially the dining room which is part of the publicly accessible area which is out of sight of the reception desk. I mentioned above that guests are given a receipt for their bags which states on the reverse (pic added for info): ""In consideration of the free storage of the property covered by this check, the owner or person depositing same agrees: This establishment is not liable for the theft, loss, damage or destruction of the property in the absence of gross negligence on the part of this establishment or its employees.""So essentially, guests are paying for their bags to be stored (despite the receipt saying free) in a public area which can be accessed by anyone, at anytime and the hotel is not liable if anything is stolen or lost! I should mention that we collected our bags ourselves from the dining area, changed for our flight in the reception toilets and were waiting for our taxi to collect us before a member of the reception staff asked if we had the receipt for our bags.

Fresh juices - orange, apples, or pineapple; milk- regular, 2%, non-fat; hot and cold box cereals are available; fresh fruits - oranges and apples; fruit bowl; Greek and regular yogurt; hot scramble eggs and meat (rotates every day -- sausage, sausage patty, or bacon); waffles; bread - white, wheat, rye, and bagels; and hot tea or coffee. Hot tea and coffee available all day. I enjoy drinking their coffee. When I come back from all day outing, I stop by for a cup of coffee to bring up to my room, (I am a regular coffee drinker every day at home - drip brew or on the go - chain cafes)Our room on the 25th floor was well decorated, nice room colors, clean and bright with the sunlight coming in. There were good space to walk around the bed without bumping into each other. The shower stall was large and roomy....I didn't touch the walls if I dropped by soap bar. I also enjoyed looking at the building rooftops and taller buildings over in the next block. This hotel is well located in mid-town New York. It is right in the middle of the shopping district. Macy is one block away. Victoria Secret, H&M, Forever 21, and Target are 6-minute walk away. (I have been to NYC seven times; this time we skipped the Broadway shows and stay Midtown to be different) I really like the Hyatt Place location. Only 3-minute walk to Herald Square subway station and 6-minute walk to Greeley Square subway station. Only 7-minute walk to Koreatown where there are over 30 restaurants, cafes, and bars. Several restaurants are open 24 hours a day. (nice if you are arriving in town late at night)Shopping all day and Eating all day and night. I am coming back!!","San Francisco, California",84,5.0

Overall staff were friendly and helpful when needed but also gave me a lot of space. My favorite staff was housekeeper Elizabeth – she is such a joy, please give my thanks to her for her hospitality, I always look forward to greeting her in the morning. The hotel was also accommodating of a request to change rooms, as the room that I was initially assigned to was on a lower floor, which wouldn’t work. As a business traveller, it is important to have a guaranteed space in the elevator as it gets very packed particularly during the morning rush hour. I always return to this hotel as I like its convenient proximity to transport, dining, and entertainment, but will have second thoughts after a recent encounter.I think that the hotel could improve on communication. We intended to extend our reservation by half a day but were left confused as various staff provided us with differing accounts on pricing, process and timing. We decided to book the extension anyway as we needed it to accommodate our flight timing. We were clear to communicate to the staff that we had a late flight so a paid extension would put us in the ideal situation. To cut the long story short, instead of being checked out, we ended up getting kicked out on checkout day as “the hotel was full”. We were given a 15 min grace period to move our stuff or risk being charged an extra day despite the hotel being “full” (which I assume means that were paying guest next in line). While we were not looking to play the blame-game as there was clearly a miscommunication, the manager on duty had failed to take ownership of the situation and instead left us in the lurch. It was already difficult on us to be taken by surprise but we felt more intimidated by the manager who was extremely defensive and spoke to us with a obey-my-policy-or-be-at-my-mercy tone. When we were a foot out of the door, the manager called us back to let us know that a reservation was cancelled and we were at liberty to book it for an extra day if we preferred. This was in my opinion a slap to the face after the inconvenience and unpleasantries and all the more affirmed my view that we were forever at their mercy.thank you Hyatt Place, it's been a great couple of years, but I think I will be moving on from here.","Singapore, Singapore",75,3.0

Check-in was the only truly disappointing part of my stay. That is because I booked an accessible room and it was not ready when I tried checking in at 3:30 in the afternoon. Apparently, the prior guest broke the blinds and they needed to be fixed. But considering I had tried to check in early (I arrived in the city about 10:30 AM), I thought they should have been aware that I wanted to check in and should have been on the issue first thing. Unfortunately, we didn't actually get into the room until about 4:30 PM. One bright spot was that David had the intelligence to offer us a little something for the wait, so we each got a drink on the hotel. :)Having said all of that, the rest of my stay here was good.

This hotel comes nowhere near to touching the heals of it's Santiago sister....but different cities means different prices, spaces etc.Let's get the bad out of the way first.- The rooms are on the tiny side and storage space is, well, awful (a closet with only enough space for 5 coat hangers and some drawers).- the hotel feels run-down (no surprise when you see the immense traffic flow through this hotel on a daily basis)- the hotel has ridiculous breakfast hours (ends at 9 on weekdays and 10 on weekends). For a hotel that goes after leisure guests, these times seem ludicrous. The cynic in me says this is done on purpose.....as the hotel hopes that people might not even bother.- those who do bother to come down pretty much all arrive in the final 45 mins......which leads to massive queues and nowhere to sit- the breakfast is touch and go, but all in all, not half bad (though I wish they'd come up with an option to offer guests an alternative to eco-killing disposable cups for coffee)- the hotel needs some new towels!- at around 370 USD a night, this was not a cheap hotel The good:- the bed is super comfy and the linen is actually quite nice- ALL of the staff I spoke with were incredibly helpful and attentive- the hotel's location is absolutely excellent (the Empire State Building is, quite literally, on top of you!). Most major sites are very close by with even the far away sites (WTC) only taking some 15-20 mins in an Uber- a snack bar is open 24/7- the hotel has some outdoor space on the ground floor at the front-handy for us smokers!- The WiFi is free and very speedy- The OnDemand Movie service is loaded with incredibly recent films Would I come back?

Based on my membership status, he offered us a couple of waters a day for our 4 night stay. I obtained the waters with no problem for the first 2 nights. On 4/29 however, I casually asked for the waters on the way up to my room and the lady at the front desk questioned it and proceeded to look up information in the computer. I didn't get her name but she very well might have been the manager. It was around 5 pm on the 29th of April. After looking up my information, she explained to me how I was not supposed to be getting the waters and that because of the miss communication, she will give them to me. I was caught a little off guard since we were wasting time talking about $2 Aquafina bottles. At that point I responded by asking her to keep the water bottles. I did not appreciate the attitude by the employee because of something small like this. I have been using Hyatt Hotels for a long time and most of the time they go above and beyond for customer satisfaction. But this wasn't the case. I am disappointed how this was handled.

Obviously, if you book each night differently, their system doesn't initially see it, so I received a call the next morning telling me that I needed to move to another room. After a few conversations with the morning staff, we finally sorted it out as he was unaware of the ""multiple bookings"" into one reservation; however, this gentleman decided he would school me on how I should properly book my Hyatt stays in the future (this person really needed to have his manners checked). That was the only hiccup.The rest of the staff were extremely helpful and polite. Breakfast was crowded and fortunately we were able to find seating for 4. The dining room is super tight and very difficult to pass thru, but it's NYC so hotel space is limited. Our room and additional space were so welcomed after being out in the city all day. My only issue was the A/C unit was very finicky and not easy to use. I think the thermostat had a mind of it's own because I kept changing the temp and it would never change. I asked the front desk to take a look at it, but I'm not sure they got around to it. We received 2 bottled waters every day complimentary.This location cannot be beat.

In that sense, the Hyatt knocks it out of the park.The Hotel - attractive hotel with ample lobby seating and even small front patio. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The bed and furnishings looked newer than most I’ve seen in NYC hotels. I found the refrigerator to be too loud so I unplugged it. Problem solved. I stayed on a high floor so the street noise was subdued. The front desk staff are very friendly, helpful, and quick. Check out took less than a minute. I usually scoff at “breakfast included” marketing, but the food was quite good. The buffet is in a well-spaced area so you don’t feel like someone is constantly standing in your way, and the choices will satisfy most visitors: cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, eggs, French toast, fruit, and bacon. The coffee is hot & robust- just as you’d expect in NYC. Finally the location is ideal for someone looking to get the most out of their visit to The City. It’s walking distance from Penn Station, a couple blocks from a main shopping area, and close to many subway lines. Would I return for a business trip? Probably not. However, I would return for a fun trip to NYC. I’d also recommend it to others in this regard. It’s a 1st rate budget hotel without the budget feel (smelly cleansers, bad food, lumpy bed, paper-thin walls). The Hyatt gets inexpensive travel right! ","San Francisco, California",7,5.0

This problem would be resolved if they extended their finishing time by 1 hour. Even for people sightseeing it is way to early to be up on your holidays and as the breakfast is included most people want the value for the money they've spent. I went to breakfast once in 4 days because on the first day while carrying a very hot cup of tea another guest bumped into me (it was not his fault it was because of the large volume of people in the small breakfast room) and my wrist was scalded. The member of staff got me ice and an ice pack but when I asked for burn gel they had none. I went to the pharmacy straight away and got some so this saved the burn blistering. The staff member was very nice and helpful but I can't understand why a big hotel like this does not have burn gel for instances like this. So although your stay includeds breakfast I wouldnt count on it.

I chose the hotel because of its location. Relatively close to Times Square, good transport links close by (34th Street/Herald Square subway). It was a good choice. The rooms were an OK size for New York. We managed to get four people into ours with not too much difficulty. The view was fantastic, staring at the Empire State Building just two blocks away. Front desk staff were very friendly and questions/assistance offerred promptly. We had two minor issues that required maintenance to help during our stay. Both were addressed very quickly and satisfactorily.New York was a bit crazy given the time of year. People everywhere, however we found the hotel to be a bit of a quiet sanctary, even though it was full. Breakfast was the only time the place seemed full on. Get down early to get a table. Great that breakfast was included, basic selection, but satisfied hunger pangs. Eating in NYC is not cheap so to have an included meal was good.As noted by others, waiting for elevators (lifts) can be a bit of a pain. Only two for a 27 storey building. if you are on a lower floor use the stairs as quicker than waiting. We had no choice but to wait as on 17. This however is the only negative I can think of.

Hotel was very quiet during the night. There are only six rooms per floor (I think) and so the traffic on each floor is very light and makes for a peaceful experience. It's clean and comfortable. The rooms are small, as expected in the city but large enough for a sofa by the bed, a fridge and plenty of space for luggage. The shower was amazing - and TALL (for us over 6 feet.) They offer the rare complimentary breakfast down in the lobby area, which is so popular it is hard to find seating, perhaps extended hours could make this option more possible for everyone. Wi-Fi was a little slow, but included. Can't complain, this hotel doesn't charge the dumb ""resort fees"" all the hotels are starting to add. Another reason we chose it.

It’s free, it has a massive array of items and a different hot option everyday such as bacon, sausage, egg, French toast, pancakes and there are signs everywhere, including in the lifts telling you at what times it gets busy. We went once when it was busy and after a short wait got a seat. The rest of the time we went around 8 am and got a seat without issue. The staff replenish the breakfast continually and there is a good choice of cereals, breads, doughnuts, fresh fruit salad and porridge. If you don’t like queues go early. For nyc I thought this was a great extra at no cost.Reception staff were really helpful and you could buy drinks, alcohol and food from them if you wished. They also stored your luggage in a secure room upon checkout.The hotel is close to the subway and herald square which is approx 3 mins walk away.

As an Expedia rewards member, I found this hotel for under $200 a night, and decided to book it for two nights since I had never stayed there, and wanted to make sure it was as advertised and a reasonable walking distance from where I would be spending most of my days. When I received my confirmation by email a few minutes later, I realized they had only booked and charged me for one night. I immediately called the front desk, explained the error, and asked if they could make the correction. I was told that they would not be able to match the rate and that the rate had to be set through Expedia. I called Expedia, and THEY said they would have to call the hotel to get their permission to do so. The Hotel manager refused, and then Expedia informed me that they could not add a night, but would have to cancel my reservation ( at $200.00 / night ) and re-book it for 2 nights at $500 plus a night ! ( $1025 with tax, more than 5 times the advertised rate ) I asked the Expedia rep if she realized what she was asking me to do, got a moment of silence, then I refused, and kept the one night @$200.00, since they had already charged my credit card. I arrived at the Lobby and spoke with the manager. He said he was unable to help me since “rates are subject to change without notice.” I tried again the following morning, and would have been willing to accept some type of compromise, since we were already checked in. But there was absolutely no effort form management to even try to adjust the rate even though there was plenty of availability. The only response was “Sorry , our rates are subject to change.” I checked out and spent the rest of the week at a 4 star hotel 3 blocks away. It was like a classic “bait and switch scheme” which I would not have expected from a Hyatt Hotel. The next morning, while sitting at breakfast in my new hotel, I received an email from Hyatt, welcoming me to the “Hyatt Experience”. Really???",,0,1.0

Unfortunately I had a bad experience with major partying going on in the room next door. Went on to the early hours, manager on duty was called at 2am, and went to the room requesting them to quieten down. 3am, continued, manager requests again, 4am, Manager asks them to leave the hotel which was great. What wasn't great was that there was no security and after they were evicted from hotel, came up the stairs back into the room after 4am and used their key cards again as the Manager did not take them off them. And to add to all that, was threatened by one of the party goers at the lift the next morning. As I was a women travelling alone, that was very freighting. Hotel were apologetic of course, and refunded my night, but is a serious issue when the party goers get chucked out of hotel only to be able to get right back in again. Breakfast was far not great at all, impossible to get a seat after 7.30am. Location was great.

The area feels safe, and close to many places to eat. The rooms are clean, and for NYC a comfortable size. A favourable thing also is there are only a small number of rooms on each floor so you do not have to drag your bags down long hallways, and the chances of being disturbed by other guests is low, making it a quiet hotel. I did not notice any street noise at all, another plus as this is a common experience in New York Hotel rooms.I did not try the breakfast so can not provide insight into that, but I liked that they provided cards in the rooms that guided on when the best times were based on the times people use the facility.Unfortunately I did have issues, but the responsiveness to these has helped change my thoughts on this hotel. Housekeeping did not respond to my request for a Hairdryer - turns out it is in the drawer under the TV. The biggest issue I had was when I arrived parts of the carpet were saturated (apparently as a result of the storm that came through NYC that day), so I provided feedback to housekeeping who did try to remediate, however, when I returned to the hotel mid afternoon to find a carpet machine in the room, it did mean I could not take a short break before heading downtown. I asked at reception how long it will be to which I was told I could still use the room, and my response of 'well its hardly peaceful' was met with nothing more than an 'I know'. There was no acknowledgement of the inconvenience, or apology at the time. Through their customer service feedback to management I raised these issues, and to their credit, Kyle responded very quickly and acknowledged the shortfalls of my experience. This customer service does make me respect a place more, so thankyou, that has made me reconsider when to try Hyatt Place again.

The location is great. One block to subway. Walking distance to many iconic NYC buildings and locations that we are all familiar with from news, movies, etc. The problems: I found the front desk staff to be friendly but not proactive in solving problems. I had to get a supervisor in order to get a change in rooms as the first room choice was totally inappropriate. Later I had to ask for towels that were not replaced. The front desk agreed to take care of it and did not. It took me a couple of tries to get the people that serviced our room to give us extra pillows and to replace the worn out pillows. They should be authorized to make those changes on the fly as they see the wear and tear every day.The biggest challenge is the two elevators. Normally they are fine. During busy hours, particularly the last hour before breakfast ends, they are terrible. One day I had to go down from the 11th floor to the first floor by stair. My wife figured out that, rather than waiting 15-20 minutes and seeing full elevator after full elevator, she hit both the up and down button, caught an elevator going up which then guaranteed her that she would have an elevator to go down in. I cannot recommend that wheelchair or mobility challenged individuals have to deal with this. However, we now understand the issue and can work around it.

I am really happy that your people understand that in order to get those points, we stayed many other times at a Hyatt and also use our Hyatt Credit card for almost everything. We were given a great room on the top floor, amazing view and very quiet (which was wonderful bc I had come down with an awful cold and wasn't sleeping well to begin with). The hotel itself was really nice! We normally stay at the Grand Hyatt by Grand Central Station, but honestly we don't use most of the amenities bc we are out all day and night with business and social engagements when we are visiting NYC. Hyatt Place was also closer to the subway lines we use most via Herald Square. The Hyatt Place obviously is a different type of hotel from The Grand Hyatt, but was a great hotel, and perfect for our needs. We will definitely consider it again in the future. We are rarely brand loyal for things these days, but we are generally Hyatt loyal bc we just don't have time to read 1000 reviews on Tripadvisor. We are normally on a deadline with chaotic travel needs, and just want to book something quickly and know it's going to be good. We have never been disappointed with any Hyatt stay. We are not particularly demanding guests, but even if something was amiss once in awhile, it has always been quickly addressed if possible. I don't usually write reviews bc time is just non-existent, but the staff was wonderful and we were really happy with how we were treated.

However if its simply a place to sleep, then you should be okay.The hotel itself is well located right next to the Empire State Building which puts it about 15 minutes walk to Times Square and Broadway and 25 minutes to Central Park. Around the corner is the Herald Square Subway and one block further the Penn Subway Station so using the transit system is big plus.The check-in was rush hour so it was bit chaotic with the two clerks doing double duty in managing the bar and snacks as well as fielding phone calls. However they tried the best and was efficient in the off-peak hours. The hotel is clean and the rooms well kept.Breakfast was included and the buffet contained the basics which did not vary over the week but very congested after 8:15am due to the 9:00 am shut down; as vacationers one would expected a longer opening hours. Rooms on the higher levels were noise free but did not offer much of a view as there were many other taller buildings in the area.

Interesting enough, the staff told me they couldn't change my room because I did registered online. Although I reserved asking for a high floor, the automated check in gave me the worst possible room i.e 3rd floor (out of 25), and just above the entrance on the noisy street side. Therefore, never use the advance check in sent by e-mail! I was told I should have contacted the hotel staff directly after reservation asking for a high floor and a quiet room. Good to remember.

If someone is having a hard time, and is further annoyed by something that otherwise isn't annoying = bad review... and the same on the other end of the scale. We stay in NYC at a minimum twice a year. We have done the airbnb thing, stayed with friends, etc. This is because most places are too expensive or are complete dumps. This place is so sweet. Is it fancy? nope, is it super modern? nope, were there tourists everywhere?, yep.... but hey, its in the middle of Manhattan, litterly a stones throw from the Empire State Building. Why someone would be surprised or annoyed by this place being ""full of people"" or ""crowded"" is beyond me. That same person must have despised NYC in general.  The staff (Maribel, Andrea, and Mabley in particular) were professional, attentive, informed and just cool overall. The terrace on the 26th floor is worth the already inexpensive price tag.

Initially our vacation started a little rocky when I found a bug in the room, however, the front desk quickly moved us to another room. We were supposed to check out 7/1, however I ended up hospitalized 6/30 and had emergency surgery to remove my gallbladder. While my husband had to pack up and move rooms, which was a hassle under the circumstances, he got it done and everything was good (or so we thought). I arrived back at the hotel 7/2 to rest until our flight home. The front desk even left cupcakes (unfortunately I cannot eat) which was a sweet gesture. I'm most upset though because my daughter had a bag with multiple signed playbills either stolen or thrown away. When we arrived back at the hotel my daughter was looking for her things and the housekeeping staff had moved several items in the room and put items in the closet (which the front desk says it NOT their policy). We called down to the front desk and as of check out, the housekeeping supervisor had no idea who cleaned our room 7/2 AM. My teenage daughter is heartbroken, as she had put them in a separate bag on top of the desk, not knowing they would be stolen or thrown away. We spent a lot of money on shows and stood at 5 stage doors for hours to get these autographs. As an aspiring actress, they are priceless to her. I'm still kind of shocked at the nonchalance of the front desk. Are we talking diamond jewelry, no, but this was extremely important to her and they are irreplaceable.","Brandon, Florida",11,2.0

I found the Hyatt Place through Booking.com and got a very nice deal for the week. I phoned the hotel and informed them of our anniversary, and the hotel staff took care of the rest from there.Upon check-in, once we got to the place (getting lost in Manhattan while walking is not a fun experience when carrying luggage, a cab is highly advised!), we found ourselves at the top floor, in one of four penthouse suites (I suppose... not big enough to be called a suite really but it was far more than what we expected!) with a gorgeous skyline view of the city. A care package had been left in our room, and the first night we decided to just order in. The hotel does offer room service, as it were, but it's pick-up. No big issue there.We felt like we were in the Waldorf-Astoria (which will no longer be the same once it reopens... so sad!) we were treated so well. The room was superb, although a tad cramped for space towards the window. We wound up putting the ottoman on its side and tucking it away so we wouldn't trip over it. The in-hotel breakfast was excellent!! Everything was refilled constantly, and the hot stuff kept hot, cold items kept on ice... excellent job, Hyatt!! This is a good hotel for the center of Manhattan, and within walking distance to the Empire State Building. Very friendly red-vested CityPass or NewYorkPass agents outside the hotel will direct you wherever you need or want to go, and will remember you for multiple-day stays. Some even become friends ;)We'll definitely be returning. Now if they'd only lower their one-night-stay prices a little... I could afford to stay more often :)","Aberdeen, Maryland",11,5.0

Empire state building was just a block away, Shake Shake was 2 blocks and plenty of Walgreens nearby in case you forgot something like we did. The included breakfast was as expected for the Hyatt, eggs, toast, pancakes, occasional potato, cereal, fruit,etc. The rooms seemed tight but since this is my first trip to NYC I have heard they were spacious for a NYC hotel room. My only complaint would be that the pillows are extremely flat. I never did ask for a new one and they may have been accommodating had I done so but i just doubled up my pillows.

Definitely no complaint here though, especially if you are on a little weekend getaway. Location is excellent and you can walk to a lot of places and easily get several metro lines.Breakfast is okay and varied from day to day a little, which was nice. Lines do form around 8:15/8:30 but they notify you of that on posters in the elevator so it is no surprise.I was on a higher floor, which was great with nice view and less noise but the elevators in this hotel are truly awful. There are only two and they are slow. So if you are trying to get anywhere during a busy time (breakfast, evening when everyone comes back) plan ahead. My key stopped working and I had to go back down to get it re-coded. It took 20 minutes - and it was not the staff/desk that was the issue. They were speedy. It was the elevator waiting and then stopping on every floor on the way up. Oh, and in the morning the cleaning crew uses the main elevator so expect a few more stops for that. They really should get a service elevator. Staff was okay. Nice enough but mostly lackadaisical. Clearly not a four star + hotel. It is a Hyatt Place after all. Overall it is a solid place to camp out for a few days; for business, however, I'd prefer a different type of hotel.

It was so clean, (thank you Housekeeping!) very quiet and a view of the top of the Empire State Building. I was blown away! The room was equipped beautifully but the thing I liked was that the shower doors slid sideways so you could start the water without being splashed. Every morning there was a great complimentary breakfast! I met a wonderful lady, Jemima, who was very kind and welcoming. Mario and Maritza were super helpful and worked hard to set the food up and any help I needed!The hotel is in a great location. Close to Herald Square and lots of areas to explore. In my comings and goings, I met other front desk staff who were friendly and kind and also met David, who is super and amazing! When I had to leave to get to the airport, Andrea at the Front Desk checked me out. She was wonderful and asked how may stay was. I told her it was amazing!So to the Management if the Hyatt Place New York/Midway Hotel, I say Thank you!Your staff: Mr. Weiss, Jonathan, Sandor, Housekeeping, Jemima, Mario, Maritza, David and Andrea are First Class!I hope to return soon to your hotel!Thank you again!

Nothing special that other hotels were not offering. I would stay here again knowing what I can expect in a room. Bed was a bit hard for my liking. The view from the window in the room was somewhat ugly as a water tower was in direct line of site between the hotel and the empire state building.

Rooms on the back side are quiet, I prefer a low floor at this location due to the slow elevators (mentioned in many reviews). It's easy to walk down to lobby/street level from a low floor. Rooms at this Hyatt Place are larger than most NYC hotels, although they are not the usual layout of most Hyatt Place locations with a totally separate living area. The sofa and ottoman in the room make a big difference in comfort. My stay this time was greatly enhanced by excellent service from front desk employee William H. He went over and above to help me several times, especially at check-in. My only complaint from this stay is the hotel has removed the full-length mirror in the room, it used to be on the closet door. The closet door was not there, I thought that very odd. A floor-length mirror is a must in any hotel room, not having one is a problem.I would definitely stay at this property again and do recommend it to others. ","Rowe, New Mexico",65,4.0

It was also my partners Birthday and friends of ours had organised a bottle of champagne to be sent to the room on our arrival which the hotel sorted out without any problem. Directly across the road is an Irish bar which do lovely food and on the corner of the block is a nice Resturant. Just a short walk down the block is Macy's and lots of other shops.

Eventually they located someone who stopped by and did a rush clean. Another day the young lady on reception had a bit of an attitude when I was asking to pay my bill. Other than these small things there really isn't much wrong with the Hyatt. The breakfast room is not big enough, and if you're not down early you will be lining up or going somewhere else for breakfast. Maybe they should look at the 1st floor or basement as a possible solution to this. The hotel is simply too big for the current breakfast room to handle.

My response was quick and I was kindly told me my request has been added to my reservation. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were given a room on the 5th floor. We explained we had contacted CS in March but they knew nothing about it and the 5th was the highest floor they could offer but if we came back down in the morning once some people had checked out, we may get something better.Our first night, at the front of the hotel was a very noisy, sleepless one but thankfully we ended up with a nice quiet room on 24th floor with a fantastic view of the empire state building out of our window - huge thank you to Tamon for sorting that for us!

But it's free which many of the other hotels don't offer so can't complain. They had English breakfast tea which was really good to see. The lift was slow when busy but we also noticed it would get stuck in one place a lot - don't know if this was the cleaners keeping it there or someone messing about but it got frustrating.Hotel is in a fantastic location, plenty of shops, restaurants etc within walking distance. Bryant Park, Macys and Times Square all very close (highly recommend Bubba Gump!). We even walked down to the Brooklyn bridge and into Brooklyn one day!

I asked if this included the toll etc and she said 'yes, everything' but the driver wanted more once we got there. Thankfully we hadn't spent up and were too tired to argue. It was a really nice car though - not a yellow cab.I didn't realise until we got home that Hyatt have hotels around the world; would I stay here again?

The desk was very accommodating. We came in later one afternoon and wanted to buy some bottled water, (at $4. a bottle), they gave it to us instead.

We noticed a few late comers surprised to see breakfast ended at 9:00am on weekdays. The dining area is awkward and can be difficult to navigate through when crowded. There are 2 elevators that can get claustrophobic and move at a snail's pace during high traffic breakfast time. A fitness room is also available in the basement.Room:Comfortable size considering you're in New York. Bed was extremely comfortable.

Yes, they warn you about queues for the breakfast so you can avoid them - but the issue I had was not simply with the quality of the breakfast, but the fact that it is served on non-recyclable plastic covered paper plates, which are then thrown out. In my opinion, if you are going to put up a sign in the bathroom saying that you are an eco-friendly hotel, so please reuse towels (which I'll happily do), please use plates and a dishwasher for the hundreds you serve every morning.

The parking was based on 24-hour and we parked on a Tuesday night and wanted to use the car on Friday, but were told if we pull out that ends our stay. To get back in the clock starts all over. We wanted to put some luggage in the car and do some sightseeing but were also told if they pull the car up its out of the garage AND we couldn't go to our car to drop anything off.

Contrast since both hotels have similar floor layout.Check-in was super fast and friendly staff. Our King Room was on 23th floor (floors only have 8 rooms each). Stunning view (see pic) with floor to ceiling windows. Very bright. Very large for NYC standard. Plenty of room for 2 people and include a couch. Windows relatively soundproof (this area of town has lots of construction). Bedding comfortable, plenty of lighting, desk area workable (not large but enough and well designed). Bathroom was large walk-in shower and in good repair. AC worked well and was quiet and not drafty. Internet speed (free) was excellent. Business center had super fast printer and easy to quickly print out boarding passes.Breakfast was included, nothing special, there are plenty of places to wander to in less than a block, but on a cold or rainy day a nice touch.Overall, very positive hotel and I would look to re-book here on a future stay. Hyatt knows how to run hotel properties and it shows.Note: 26th floor has open terrace (no food service), but nice view of Empire State Building.

You cannot even see the hotel if you stand at the end of the street. The front lobby, not much to it. Front desk person… she should have been doing the dishes in the back or emptying the trash cans. I am not kidding you, this person only words to me were “id and credit card”. Nothing else. Good thing she wrote the room number on the key card envelope. Where do they find these people anyway???? Oh well…. The room, on the 25th floor was great. Excellent view of the Empire State building from our room. Room was large (by New York standards), even had a couch, coffee and refrigerator. Things I have given up completely from New York hotels.The hotel does not have pool, but it does have a gym. They also have a free breakfast, not cooked to order, but they do have hot items. The food is average. Being New York, expect large crowds at breakfast time. So pack your patience or take your breakfast to go.There is a bar, kind of… you must go to the front desk and ask someone to get you a drink… really, not kidding. The Best Western right next door has a small bar with a bartender. We actually went there for drinks. Much nicer and relaxed.The best part about this hotel is its location. 15 minute walk to the Flatiron building, 15 minute walk to Times Square, and it is right next to Macy’s so lots of shopping to be done.

As a frequent traveler, I know that buffet scrambled eggs are usually nothing special, but the ones here at Hyatt Place were as good as if they'd been ordered a la carte. I took special notice of how well designed the bathroom was. Plenty of towels, and careful attention to details like a grab-bar in the shower that had a textured hand-hold rather than just being a slick metal tube.

Having stayed at many so called 4-star hotels in NYC in the past where you pay top dollar for a very old property with mediocre rooms and service people endlessly asking for tips, it was nice to come to a brand new modern property like this one.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and unlike the rest of New York definitely not looking to dress you down for tips which was a huge welcome. The rooms were clean, and decently sized for NYC, with extremely reliable and fast wifi and a decent included breakfast buffet. The location was of course unbeatable as it was right in Midtown, a short 10 minute walk from Times Square with none of the noise and crowds.Unfortunately for us, there was construction going on across the street during our stay. Nothing like waking up to jackhammers at 8am every day. As well, if you arrive a bit late to breakfast it was hard to find a seat as they could not clean fast enough to keep up. Finally with only 3 slow elevators, it was always a long wait to go up and down.Still even with all of the negatives, the hotel did everything it does extremely well, and along with the extremely reasonable price, I would not hesitate to stay here the next time I am in New York City.

I called a few days before we were leaving to see if the room was available to add on Wednesday night- not only was it available but the nightly rate was reduced to $109...for ALL FOUR NIGHTS! This Hyatt was very clean (which is a main criteria for my OCD cleaning self), all staff we encountered were friendly & accommodating. Only twice did i need help from the staff...the main lobby bathroom had run out of toilet paper one morning- I informed the front desk & within moments a guy arrived to fill it up & even cleaned up a bit. The 2nd time we called from our room when we noticed there wasn't a remote for the TV...idk how this man arrived so quickly with a replacement! I asked for a room our kids would like- we were given a room on the 20th floor with an awesome view of the Empire State building! My kids & I would lay on the bed at night just staring out the window at the lights of the ESB & surrounding night skyline talking about our day. This Hyatt is so centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. (I thought I'd have to spend extra money taking subways all over but we walked everywhere- except to Battery Park- 9/11 memorials, Freedom Tower area-the kids wanted to take the subway back & forth to this area then we walked around to each site :) We easily walked to Empire State Building, Times Square, Broadway (saw Finding Neverland), Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, Chrysler building,... Chelsea Market was the furthest,about 20 mins.) Back at the Hyatt...each morning after breakfast (before we got into the events planned for the day) the kids would go on the computers in the lobby area while I sat there reading the free daily news papers & striking up conversations with fellow travelers from around the globe about current events. Great overall experience staying at Hyatt Place...totally would stay there again.",new york,18,5.0

Maybe I'm being stereotypical here, but when you think of New York City hotels that are close to everything, you typically think of PRICEY, DIRTY, AND LOUD! I couldn't have been more mistaken! Hyatt Place NY Midtown South is in the perfect location. Everything is within walking distance! My fiancé and I went to a Broadway show that was just 7 blocks away at Times Square. There was a Dunkin Donuts and a Starbucks at the end of the block the hotel is on. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at a beautiful restaurant the next street over. Everything is right within your reach!Now for the cleanliness- surpassed everything I expected! We arrived at our room and it smelled fresh and clean, the bathroom was spotless, and there was not a thing out of place. Kudos to the housekeeping staff because they obviously pay very close attention to detail and it shows. The volume- As I had mentioned, we were just a few blocks away from Times Square, in the middle of New York City...and we barely heard any noise from our street-facing room on the 9th floor. Coming from a household that is always loud and dirty, I didn't want to leave this clean, quiet hotel. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because we were told that breakfast would be served until 11am. We got there at 10, and they were already putting things away, so there wasn't much of a spread.But of course, that shouldn't stop you from staying here. Beautiful hotel, wonderful views, walkable routes, and very kind and courteous staff all around. You would be a fool not to stay here!",,2,4.0

We didn't want the hotel to cost the earth given we were there to explore the city and not spend a lot of time in the hotel, but at the same time we wanted somewhere that was pleasant and a good location. Hyatt Place was exactly this and more!The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Times Square, 5 minutes away from Macy's and the New York Public Library is about 5 minutes up the road, so an ideal place to explore. Penn Station is also a 10 minute walk away if that so perfect for getting around the city/to and from airports. The hotel itself was quiet and welcoming. Staff were helpful and check in was super quick. We had heard rumours of resort fees, not related to this hotel but others, and we have previously travelled to Las Vegas where resort fees are everywhere, so we were prepared to be caught out. However, despite offering a free breakfast and Wi-Fi there were no resort fees, which was an added bonus. The room itself was perfect. We had a king size bed and a sofa in the room as well as a large TV and coffee/tea facilities. The bed was one of the comfiest I have ever slept in! The bathroom was great, good size with an amazing large shower. The whole room was quite modern and clean with maid service every day. It's not a luxurious hotel (felt like it catered to business people more so than tourists, which was actualyl a good thing) but it is perfect and has everything you need if you're after something clean, warm and tidy during a city break. Breakfast is free and it's a buffet style which we enjoyed - pancakes/French toast/hot options/fruit salad/cereal/pastries etc. This was an ideal start to each day as we didn't have to worry about finding a place to eat breakfast before we set out for the day. Wi-Fi was good although connections played up a bit (this could've been my phone though as the I-pad worked fine).The hotel is located on 36th Street which houses a few offices/businesses and a couple of bars. Our room faced this street but noise didn't really disturb us. Sometimes we heard the rubbish carts early at 5am but that didn't really bother us.Overall we were really pleased with our choice of hotel. Location, services and room prices were excellent and great value for money. Would definitely recommend staying here for a NYC break and would visit again.","Worcestershire, United Kingdom",4,4.0

The usual places I stay in midtown were overly pricey, so I stumbled upon this hotel. The price was very good for a ""holiday"" long weekend, and the location was great. I know midtown is busy and typically a place crowded with tourists, but it is also convenient if you want a central place to base in. And this hotel was in a good area. Not quite as crowded as right in times square area, and still near a number of subway lines (Herald Square station) for easy access to the city. It's half a long block and a short block from the nearest entrance, which was very nice on cold, snowy windy days! You could spend more time underground out of the weather. And if the weather is nice, it's an easy walk to popular locations and theaters.The hotel itself was quite comfortable. I booked a ""city view"" room and was glad I did. It puts you on a higher floor (and was only $10 more per night). This is nice if you want to be ""above"" a lot of the city noise, although the streets right around the hotel are not overly noisy. The hotel is small per floor - seemed like 10-12 rooms to a floor, but the rooms themselves were quite good sized for NYC (not sure why others thought they were small - they must have stayed in much more expensive hotels in NYC than I have - and usually stay in the mid-range hotels similar to Hyatt and up). I was lucky and had very quiet neighbors, so I can't say how much room noise you might hear. The elevators were very fast, and not too busy when I was coming/going. Everything worked as it should in the room. The shower (no tub in my room) was very large and didn't make a leaky mess around the bathroom like many in other rooms I've stayed in. There were lots of outlets to plug your devices into, and my king room had a sofa to sit on in addition to a desk. Wifi was very good in my room.The breakfast was adequate. It was fresh and hot/cold as it should be, but there wasn't a lot of variety. The hot foods were basically the same both mornings I ate there, but there were enough other options that you could have a variety for several mornings if you wanted to. A decent sized area for sitting/eating too, although I ate when it wasn't that crowded. But it was definitely filling and included with your room price, so that's a plus in NYC for sure.Staff were very friendly and helpful and professional.Great choice for a midtown hotel and good value.",INDIANAPOLIS,20,5.0

Need I say more?All around I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. I had seen the exterior on a prior NYC visit and thought it might be worth a try. The location is good -- half a block west of 5th Avenue -- and overall it seemed to be a quiet street for midtown Manhattan. Arrival was good and the the check in quick with a very friendly staff. However when I went into the room it was not exactly what I booked. Since it was just a one night stay I figured it was not worth the effort but I mentioned it at the front desk and they insisted on making it right. They blamed Hyatt.com for not giving them complete information and even when I said I did not want to take the time/effort to move my bags they insisted and said they would happily move everything for me. They could have said well as long as you are not upset ....and left me where I was.The room was very comfortable. I booked the king bed room and while it is not large it was very good. What I really liked is it had a sofa in the window so you had a place to sit other than the less comfortable desk chair or the bed. Many of the hotels in this rate category don't have a comfy chair in the room so this was a real bonus. There was a small but workable desk, big tv and a good bed. I don't look for a frige but there was one in the room if that matters to you. Bathroom was equally serviceable with a large shower.Everything looked clean. There were some small signs of wear but nothing that was upsetting or made you hesitate.Added feature of the hotel is they include breakfast for the guests. It had a good selection of cold cereal, fruit, hot oatmeal, egg sandwiches, pancakes, breads with a toaster and coffee and tea. It is not the most elaborate but its included and no one will go hungry. (Note to management individual serve yogurt would be a good addition as opposed to an open bowl .... also better food safety.)Price wise the hotel was a few dollars more than competing products in the same area but for the room comfort I would say it is worth it versus some of the others I had stayed at in the same area.All the interactions with the staff were very friendly and them seemed genuinely interested in making sure you had a nice stay.Really no complaints .....

We did not use the parking that was available through the hotel because I found a place around the corner that was a little cheaper, however, we had to carry all of our belongings the 2-3 blocks from the parking area to the hotel and the less you have to drive in downtown, the better, so the extra money may be well spent for not having to endure those inconveniences. Upon arrival, they did not have my reservation from booking.com (which I normally call the hotel and double check, but don't usually have any problems with so I guess it slipped my mind this time), luckily the gentleman behind the counter gave us what we needed after I showed him my print out from booking.com. Thank God they even had any empty rooms! Not only that, he checked us in and told us we could go to our room and get breakfast at the buffet if we wanted!!! I kept waiting for some extra charges to show up on the bill due to these things, but there were no extra charges!! The car was cramped on our 7 hour car ride and I get frazzled from city driving, so I was extremely grateful and we promptly ate and took a nap. The location was wonderful and within walking distance of everything we needed. Our room was on the 12th floor and was spacious enough for the 5 of us with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. There was also a fridge. If you craned your neck you could see the top section of the empire state building. I never saw any housekeepers, maybe because of the holiday, but there was a fully stocked cart in the hallway both days. When we went to check-out, the hotel was gracious enough to hold our bags until we returned so that we did not have to lug everything with us or cut our trip short because of this. This made me extremely happy!! Everyone we had contact with was very nice and I feel this hotel was a great deal. The only negative things I have to say are that the buffet isn't amazing, but it is way more than most hotels offer in the area for free and the added value for a family is worth it.

I found a coupon through Costco and was able to get a rate for around $330/night. The rooms are not too large but that's expected when staying in Manhattan. I also liked how there was free internet and a full breakfast. When reading reviews on TA, I was concerned regarding the complaints about the wait time for the elevator, but we never had a to wait for more than 2 minutes even during the peak breakfast time and most times there was a very short wait for it. There's only 8 rooms per floor so it's not like you're staying in a massive hotel with only two functioning elevators. Also, my only concern was that our room was never cleaned when we stayed there. Granted, we are from Los Angeles and were late risers, but still, our room was never cleaned even though we were gone for several hours at a time. We saw the housekeeping cart outside and saw her cleaning the other rooms when we would leave but she never cleaned our room for some reason.The hotel has a great location and is right off Herald Square and close walking distance to major sites including Macy's, the Flatairon Building, the Empire State Building and Times Square. Another thing I liked was that there wasn't too much noise at night (we stayed on the 18th floor), which is rare for a hotel in Midtown but I think it's because it's off 36th St. which isn't a majorly chaotic street. I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt and Sheraton by Times Square before and remember I could still hear noise from the streets even though we were staying towards the top of the building.Just a tip, when leaving JFK airport, take the AirTrain to Jamaica Station then take the Long Island Railroad into Penn Station and walk about 10 minutes to the hotel. Don't take the subway into the city because that was brutal and took over an hour to reach Penn Station with so many stops. When we arrived we asked someone at the info desk at JFK about how to get into the city because we didn't want to pay $70 for a taxi and she advised us to take the E line but that was completely wrong and a waste of time. The LIRR will get you to Penn Station in about 15-20 minutes with two stops only.","Los Angeles, California",39,4.0

The housekeeper was cleaning the room next door, so I even took the time to catch her and tell her we were in the room next door and were leaving for the day, and that she could get in to clean whenever she wanted. I guess she didn't want to. Got back at 7pm and the room was just as we'd left it. Needless to say I wasn't happy. Still amazes me that management at some hotels don't have a system for followup checks on housekeeping to make sure rooms are cleaned by the end of the day if there was no DND sign out. We still have two more days here. Will update this review to see how they recover from this one.

It is still clean, modern, well situated and convenient. What has changed is the staff and I MEAN CHANGED!!! The former staff was so friendly, accommodating, helpful, and so interested in the guests' concerns, comforts, and needs. Update October, 2015 and the staff now is not friendly, helpful, or accommodating. They are negligent, lax, and neglectful of their duties and their guests. The maintenance people are super speedy, friendly and efficient and the staff responses to requests for towels, bedding, and other amenities is very good. Luisa, our housekeeper, was amazing. What has changed are the greetings when entering and leaving, the smiling faces of the front desk, and the night staff. Most of them do not even look up when you arrive or depart or even try to know who you are. These people need a lot of training about how to treat their guests and execute their jobs properly. They are in the service industry. Raul was the only person I found helpful and friendly. Rich is still there but was on vacation until 2 days before I left after staying there 2 weeks. He gave me a big hello as he remembered me from 18 months ago!My departure from the hotel was an abomination. I had 3 bags that I put on the elevator and arrived at the lobby. I am 71 yrs old, have a cane, and am arthritic. As i struggled to get my bags out of the elevator, members of the staff were mulling about doing nothing but talking to each other and NOT ONE PERSON came to help me. As I was getting out the second bag from the elevator, the door closed and I shot up to the 20th floor, A very nice gentleman entered and he offered to help me. When we arrived in the lobby, HE helped me out the elevator. No staff member came to help me out the door. My limo driver was waiting outside and the gentleman from the elevator helped me to the door. The gal at the front desk looked up at me and suggested I use the regular door rather than the revolving doors as it would be ""easier"" for me to get my bags to the curb!!!!!!! Hello? She couldn't call upon one of the staff doing nothing??? Raul and Rich were not on duty yet. I was absolutely fuming at this lack of professionalism. I was at a hotel, for heaven's sake! That kind of assistance should be automatic. After spending $5,500+ at this hotel for such negligent service, I was enraged at this inattentive behavior of the front desk and EVERY staff member mulling about at 7:30 AM. I really should give this hotel 2 stars but it is clean and modern. They should really get their act together.

For the regular business traveler, this is a good, solid hotel that is fairly new. The desk, housekeeping and maintenance staff are friendly and focused on customer service. HOWEVER, if you are traveling with your family, or if you plan to book a room using Hyatt points, you should be aware that the king + sofabed rooms, which are all you can book with points, are all handicap rooms. These rooms have roll-in showers with no curb, and the showerhead points directly towards the curtain rather than the wall. The result is when you take a shower the entire bathroom floor gets flooded with water. On one occasion I even had the water from the shower seep through the wall and wet the carpets next to the bed.In addition, the management at this hotel is not very focused on customer service, and if you have an issue, they are not willing to work with you to resolve the situation. In July I booked a room for business at the end of one week and the beginning of the following week, and then reserved a room with points over the weekend so my daughter could come up and spend the weekend with me. When I checked in, I asked to have the same room through the entire stay. I was told that the weekend room booked with points had to be a king + sofabed room because that's all you can book with points. I told them I didn't want a handicapped room. Of course, since I stayed there all the time, the person at the desk accommodated me and booked me in a room with two double beds for the entire stay, but told me I would need to come and have new keys made on Friday because it was in the system as separate reservations due to booking the weekend room with points. When I went down to get new keys made on Friday, I was told that I had to move rooms, apparently because the manager had removed the hold on the room for my weekend stay. After some back and forth conversation that had the desk clerk running to the office 5 or 6 times to talk to the manager on duty, the manager finally came out to talk to me personally. He was quite rude and dismissive, but finally told me he would see what he could do. I told him I had 30 minutes until I needed to leave to catch the train to the airport, and he assured me he would have an answer to me before I needed to leave. I did not hear from him, so I had to go back to the desk, where I was told the manager wasn't available, but they couldn't accommodate me and I needed to move rooms. This caused me to miss the train, which left my daughter waiting alone at Newark Airport. I sent a note to Hyatt corporate explaining the situation and asking for an apology - not because they couldn't accommodate me, but because the manager was rude and didn't do as he promised and get back to me so I could make my train. I received a reply stating that the hotel manager would contact me directly. It's been three months, and I have not heard anything from Hyatt even though I have inquired about a response since then.I will not stay in this hotel again. It's a shame, too, because it's a pretty good hotel. Still, if the manager isn't interested in good customer service, I'm not interesting in staying there. If, after all of this, you still want to stay here, I have some advice:- do not book a king + sofabed room unless you are handicapped- ask for a higher floor, because the street noise can be very loud- ask for a room at the back, which means you will have a view of the Empire State Building- the wait for the elevator is long, particularly in the morning when everyone is heading down to breakfast. Take the stairs- they have a good breakfast that's included in the room rate. It includes hot food- ask at the desk about places to eat. They sometimes have coupons.","Nashville, Tennessee",20,2.0

I was fortunate to have found this Hyatt Place as it met all of our needs. We arrived in late morning, several hours before the official check-in time. The front desk attendant offered to upgrade my family of three to a room with an Empire State Building view. Our luggage was stored for us and upon our return later in the afternoon, all we had to do was ask for our keys and head to our room. The room was very clean and well appointed. However, what we did not realize was that the rooms with the ESB view do NOT have a sleeper sofa. They just have a regular sofa. Of course, the front desk attendant should have known this, but by the time we discovered that the sofa did not fold out into a bed, we had unpacked and basically taken over the room. We decided to stay in the room and enjoy the view (as opposed to repacking and moving rooms). The room was extremely quiet and the layout of the hotel kept the hallway noise down. The breakfast room was very busy each morning, but the staff did a great job of keeping the items stocked. I agree with other reviewers that the offerings could include more items like yogurt and fresh fruit. However, the breakfast is included in your room rate and definitely helps keep the budget in check. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The property has a small outside patio area which is a nice spot to have a drink and relax. The hotel's location is very central to many NYC attractions and subway lines. We would definitely stay at this property again.","Los Angeles, California",44,4.0

But if the target travelers are middle-aged couples with disposable income and any sense of style who are coming to NYC on vacation, this hotel is missing the mark. My wife and I couldn't even begin to hang the clothes needed for even a long weekend. And the one-sink one-mirror bathroom is crazy. My suggestion? Why (oh why) is there a full-length couch in that room? Was I supposed to host a cocktail party in there? Or lie back on it and watch football or HBO when I am in NYC? What were they thinking? Remove the couch and put in 1. a vanity (with a mirror - for her) and 2.) an armoire for evening clothes and they create a room that grown-ups can actually use and enjoy.

But then again you are paying perhaps 1/4 of what they get at the Lanham just up the street on the corner of Fifth Avenue. This is a fairly new conversion of a dreary old apartment or office building. The rooms are sparkling clean and fitted out with appropriate amenities for a budget to mid-range property. It has about as much character as an airport lounge, but if you ask for a room in the back it will be quiet enough with the ""white noise of the HVAC system drowning out any traffic noise. There are only a handful of rooms on each floor, and with 28 or so floors and 2 elevators you are introduced to the typical Manhattan past time of waiting for elevators.A good firm king bed, a large flat screen television, a sofa, frigobar, desk and chair, good lighting and forgettable art work, all you need for a generic and acceptable brief stay. The tiny closet and the efficient but austere bathroom with fairly thin towels are not conducive to a lengthy sojourn. Two layers of light deadening shades keep the sunlight out and hide the very dusty windows. Too bad we are breathing that stuff in Midtown.I suspect they see this price point segment in competition with Hampton Inn and Courtyard, and frankly I think Hilton and Marriott do a better job in this sector. Still, the Hyatt staff are friendly; the included breakfast (steam table hot items and good Starbucks coffee and juice) will do; wifi, printing and nearly 24 hour food service are valued perks.Would I stay here again? Perhaps. There are plenty of hotels, and many of them new, in this price range. Location and loyalty programs will probably influence your choice.On the night and morning of our stay, the hotel was packed with mostly foreign tourists and their families, a wholesome and bargain seeking bunch.

Her tone and body language was upsetting considering I was just trying to let her know that the TV was broke (and that she should have someone fix it before the next guest arrives). She then went on to tell me that it was my fault for not having the TV fixed and that I should have done something about it earlier.

The window looked out over the city and had two blinds options - allowing in a little bit of light but protecting your privacy, or completely shutting out the light. The hotel is just down the road from the Empire State Building and not too far from Times Square. We chose this hotel due to the location. The hotel recommends that you park in the Meyers Parking Garage, just down the road from them, and then validate with the hotel before you leave. This garage was a lot more expensive than the others we saw around the city. Validating only saved $1.40 off the normal rates, so if you are ok with walking a bit more, check out the other parking garage options nearby.

One tip: bring an outlet strip for charging devices, as there were not many outlets in the room. We were on the sixth floor facing the side and had virtually no street noise. The front desk staff was extremely helpful with subway directions and restaurant suggestions, and had a baggage hold service which we used our last day there. They also leave dishes out and accessible, as well as a microwave, so if you bring back leftovers, you can warm them in the kitchen-area microwave on real plates. I would have enjoyed having coffee and tea service left out all the time, but there is a small coffee maker in the room. We found the black-out shades helpful, and were also glad we were only on the sixth floor as one of the elevators was not working one day, causing a real headache in this 26-floor property.

Some service glitches to be worked out: faucet in our room was very loose, one day our bed was made but all towels were removed. When we called for towels, they brought us a blanket. When we called again, they brought us to large towels (our room otherwise had three large towels and several small ones). The hotel didn't have a corkscrew when we bought a bottle of wine. In short, this hotel is surrounded on the adjacent blocks by similar properties from similar quality chains; when we booked, the Hyatt was cheapest, and if it was again, I'd stay there, but if not, I'd book whatever among them was cheapest since I suspect that all are similar.","San Francisco, California",45,3.0

They were good at what they did and just made our stay even more memorable. House keeping was always punctual; free breakfast - not a huge selection like Hyatt Grand etc, but a very nice one. Limited thoughtful choices, which covered various meal preferences such as - fruits, eggs, vegetarian, meats... Easily save at least $15 per person for breakfast everyday. The rooms were CLEAN and COMFORTABLE. The hotel is very well centrally located. There was the Kati Roll Company, Bryant Park, Times Square, Grand Central terminal and even the 34th street subway station entrance just around the corner. We also found the citibike's location right around the corner from the hotel, so getting around was a breeze!

We arrived at 3:30 for check in and was told our room was not ready, so we walked around for another hour waiting for housecleaning to prep the room. When we got there we asked for a phone charger and was told they don't have any. The room itself is ok, it reminds me of a motel than Hyatt Place property. It irked me that the housekeeping cart sat in the hallway during our entire stay, it was saddled with dirty cups and such. Lastly, the morning breakfast was a zoo, just jam packed with people.

We booked again based on our first experience that was wonderful, this one not so much. Check in lasted for ever as our receptionist did not find our reservation, she made us go to the computer and print it as wifi in the lobby was not working and I could not acces to my hyatt account using my phone. They did not have the room we had booked available so they made an ""upgrade"", now, we had reserved in advance and got a rate that was $40 higher that the daily rate at check in, need with the room upgrade we ended up paying $20 more per night than if we just walked in to the hotel. That policy is absurd and was what made me stop using Hyatt for over a year, thought I should give a second chance but, maybe not. I did address the issue to the front desk manager and his answer was, ""I bet you would be happy is rate was now higher wouldn't you?"" Well of course I would, cause that is the whole point of booking in advance isn't it? What is the point of booking 2 months before if my rate will be higher? How do you plan to encourage early booking with that policy? At the end I just had to pay the way I had reserved, so it will be the last time I do it. If I ever stay in a Hyatt again I guess I will just show up at the reception and that will give me the better rate. And just to make it clear, it is not about the 20 or 40 bucks, it's about the nonsense policy and the lack of customer service and willing to work things out. Regarding the hotel it self, rooms were nice and clean and breakfast was good. Elevators are not enough, even there pretty fast there is only 2 of them and this is a 25 floor building with like 10 rooms on each floor, so you always have to wait a lot. The ""bellboy"" Richie was nice at first but always expected a tip and even asked for it and got rude if he didn't like what he got, we saw this with other guests as wells. Tip is not mandatory last time I checked, and you can not expect money every time you see a guest or open a door. Location is good. Close to everything but in a less crowed area.

The hotel is centrally located in midtown Manhattan, just blocks from the drop-off points for the various bus services that run between Washington and New York. In addition, the hotel is close to Herald Square (shopping) and four major subway lines. On race day it was very easy to catch the subway to the runners’ entry point into Central Park. Similarly, it was easy to catch the train from the finish on Wall Street back to the hotel.The rooms are clean and well-maintained. Some travelers may find the closet a bit small for longer stays, but it was fine for an overnight trip. I always appreciate the refrigerator, where I can store my food and drinks. The bathroom in my room only had a shower (no tub), so travelers should take that into account.As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, I stay at Hyatt hotels all over the world, and I am always impressed by the friendliness of the staff at this hotel. In my view, they exceed the level of service found in “high end” hotels. I was greeted with a smile and the associate actually looked at me when she was talking to me. She walked out from behind the desk to give me some bottled water and my room key, then pressed the elevator button for me. That really helped, since I had my arms full with my luggage and stuff. When it was time to check out, another associate stopped what he was doing to assist me.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",80,4.0

First the room is less than 1/2 the size of any other location. I get it, it's NY, but the closet couldn't hold ANY other clothing than our two coats! There is no place to stop and unload. I stopped in front of the hotel for 10 seconds to drop off my wife and luggage and an employee was shooing me away. The hotel has a relationship with a parking garage 1/2 a block down the street, but it's $39 per 24 hour period and if you stay 48 hours and 1 minute, they charge you for 3 days! Rip Off. Lastly it's noisy. I stayed on the 19th floor, but the windows were so thin it sounded like I was on the first floor with the windows open. There are honking horns, construction across the street and an endless string of garbage trucks picking up, backing up and generally making noise all night long. This hotel looks exactly like 3 other hotels next to it, the Best Western next door and two on the back side, I think a Hampton Inn or HIlton Garden.

Don't really understand the Hyatt Group but would assume Hyatt Place is a cheap version of a Hyatt or Regency.Location was great and room was more spacious than many that you'd find in New York.

There were plenty of free tables but most were covered with dirty plates and cutlery and had to be self-cleared;- There was no milk or teabags in the bedroom - the front desk sent up teabags but made us go down for the milk;- The fitness centre was out of action but no one told us this when we checked in. I had to find out one morning when I woke early to find a sign up on the door. It was too cold and icy to train outside so I went back to bed but struggled to sleep;- I was heading out of town for a couple of days and called in advance to check I could leave my large suitcase which I was told was fine. When I came down early to check the case, the receptionist refused to take it. I asked her to call the manager, whom she told me would say the same thing. Luckily he overruled her and they kept my case. I was also interrogated as to the name of the person who had said I could leave it in the first place. All I could remember was that it was a lady but knew nothing more of this. I excused myself from the grilling as my coach was due to leave.- At the same time, another customer was complaining about the fitness centre. She was being treated horrendously and being told to walk 5 blocks to a sister hotel - in her gym kit in -20c. She asked the same receptionist to call the Holiday Inn next door to see if they had a reciprocal arrangement but couldn't get through. She then summoned the bellboy to go and get the direct number so she could call through - rather than just asking him to pop next door and check.There were a couple of friendly staffers - including the couple of guys who dealt with my bags on the final day, but the whole trip was soured by a few things that are so easily avoidable, particularly when the hotel is acting as your sanctuary from the worst winter in history!","London, United Kingdom",20,2.0

We were always greeted with a smile, a comment about the weather, a question about how our day was, whether we needed anything, etc. They seemed genuinely happy to be there, and were very helpful & friendly.Secondly, the room.

Everything we needed was easily accessible, and the space itself is very well thought out.I had read many comments about the elevators, and I'm not sure whether it was an anomaly or whether they've actually fixed it, but we had absolutely no issues.

There was never any quilt cover on the bed, just a duvet and a sheet! This is something I've never heard of before! So unhygienic, as you don't know how often the duvets are washed. The flat sheet had a hole in, the fitted sheet was always wrinkled and one day when they changed the sheets they put a dirty sheet on with marks on! Our room didn't get cleaned for 2 days. We assumed the first day that maybe it was because it was a Sunday. But when we returned Monday evening and our room still hadn't been cleaned we went down to ask. Reception didn't know why it hadn't been clean and sent someone up as we were heading out!Breakfast: don't even botherNo matter what time there is a ridiculous queue for breakfast. The area to sit is too small for the amount of guests. Twice when we actually bothered to go down, we had to take food up to our room as there was no space downstairs. Poor choice of selection! Went down on Xmas day thinking maybe it would be different and there were: sausages, scrambled egg and vegetarian scrambled egg. That was is for hot food! Then you had some fruit or cereals and some porridge which I thought I'd have since I didn't want the hot food and I soon have up on that... It was so thick you couldn't even move the ladle!

After staying at several different hotels in previous visits to NYC, we felt this was by far the best room we have had. It was large by NY standards, with a sofa and large ottoman, as well as a mini fridge. We also enjoyed the floor to ceiling picture windows. In fact, because we arrived a few days before Christmas and were planning to be there for almost two weeks, we went across the street to Duane Reade and bought a small (4 1/2 ft) pre-lit Christmas tree for $22 and put it up in front of the windows. Looked great and made the room festive for the holidays! There is a large seating area downstairs next to the ""kitchen"" where they serve a free breakfast. The food is mediocre at best and the line is sometimes long. We only ate there about 4 days. The wait for the elevators can also be very lengthy. Those are the two biggest negatives we encountered, and the only reason I rated it as very good instead of excellent. We were on the fifth floor and our view was of 36th St., but I believe some of the upper floors have excellent views of the city (especially with those big windows). There was quite a bit of street noise, so the upper floors would probably have less of that as well. Free wi-fi was a plus for us, and fairly uncommon in NYC. The location is great, with easy access to subways at 35th and 6th Ave. and at Herald Square. Easy walk to Times Square, Chelsea, Murray Hill.

The hotel is exactly what we had hoped for - spotless, modern and comfortable rooms, convenient location, very friendly and competent staff, and great value for the money. The only thing I didn't like is that the fridge in the room was so loud I had to unplug it to sleep. This would have been an issue for me had I needed the fridge. I couldn't sleep with it running even with ear plugs in. Our room was small, but very comfortable, with a couch and coffee table and a great view. The hotel offers a buffet breakfast which is included, but I have so many food allergies and sensitivities that I could only eat the fruit. My husband loved the breakfast though. The elevator can be very busy and slow during the morning breakfast rush so give yourself lots of time in the morning. There isn't much at the breakfast if you can't eat gluten or dairy (like me), but there is a fabulous smoothie place a few doors down from the hotel called Pulp Juice (it's at 16 W 36th St and basically a counter off the street so look hard or you'll walk right by it) which makes the most AMAZING smoothies with fresh fruits and veggies. I could live off their smoothies! There is also a great casual restaurant directly beside the hotel called Pure and Fresh which has the most delicious assortment of freshly made food. They make custom salads which are to die for. My husband and I ate dinner there every day. They were also very accommodating of my food sensitivities. This hotel was great. The staff were super sweet. The location was great too. It's on a quiet street in a busy area which made for a comfortable sleep. It's close to Macy's and the Empire State building and so central it's easy to get anywhere. It's great for couples and families.

The hotel is centrally located round the corner from the Empire State Building, Macy's and close to Madison Square Garden and approx 10mins walk to Times Square. The hotel is in a line up of three hotels pretty much next door to each other. Check in was fast and efficient. After reading previous reviews I asked for a room on a high floor at the back. I got a room on the 16th floor not quite so high but still a great view of the Empire State Building. I was glad I had a room at the back as the front facing rooms overlook an Irish Pub which was pretty noisy at night. My room was clean and a decent size, some previous reviewers thought the rooms small but for me it was a really good size I've stayed in places where you can just about walk round the bed and with little or no storage. It was also a bonus having a sofa in the room. There is so much to see and do in NYC there's not much time for sleeping anyway!Breakfast was included in my deal and there was a great selection on offer. During the week they serve egg white sandwiches I thought I'd have one at the weekend and found they only serve them weekdays! :( I still enjoyed the breakfast each morning but go early if you can. On my first day I didn't go down until 9.15am and it was a scene of chaos people trying to find a seat and some ended up eating their breakfast standing up.

Book directly thru Hyatt.com, and was a platinum member thru gold passport, but i digress. They offered me and my family (five year old in tow) a cab ride an relocation the the Hyatt Place Midtown on 36th st.Boy am I glad that the Hyatt Herald Square was overbooked. This was a fabulous hotel in a fabulous location. Service: Was greeted with the most respect when we arrived from Cab the other Hyatt arranged for us. Was given a cold bottle of water and assigned a room quickly. Within five minutes from arriving in our room we received a knock with a treat of cupcakes for my daughter as thank you for staying with them at the hotel. Nice touch, my daughter loved them!Throughout the stay we were always greeted nicely, in the hallway or lobby, even the people at breakfast were very accommodating to getting additional food, or clearing plates. I always say, good service is when you don't notice anything is wrong, and the staff at the Hyatt Place never did anything wrong.Room: Hotel is either fairly new, or fairly remodeled, as everything was clean and updated. Most floors only have about 8-10 rooms per floor, so hallways were always quite and clear. We had a room on the 19th floor with a unobstructed view of the Empire State Building, which was awesome. We had the two queen bed room which for NY was very large, and for any other location was on the small to average size. Quietest hotel I've ever stayed at in NYC.Breakfast: if you have stayed at a Hyatt Place before the food is as expected. All the breads, pastry, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal that is common. Daily hot foods rotate with some good breakfast sandwiches, eggs, sausage, and pancakes, french toast all rotated throughout our stay. This is not a five star breakfast, but its a fresh hearty, filling meal to start your day or sightseeing or business meetings in NYC.Location: by far the best asset is the location of the hotel. Block and a half north of subways. Four and half blocks south of bryant park, times square. Easily walking distance to empire state building, Macy's on 34th, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, 5th ave. We don't walk much at home, but my five year old had no issue as the location was so perfectly placed.So an overbooked situation at the Hyatt Herald Square turned out to be a big benefit for us as the stay at the Hyatt Place Midtown was a much better hotel and location, and service.","Inland Empire, CA",23,5.0

Unfortunately, there is an Iris Pub diagonal across the street and it is very loud. So here is the tip. Rooms 5,6,7 and 8 face 36th Street and the Pub, so if you are not above the 20th floor, it will be loud. Rooms 1,2,3 & 4 face the back and may offer a better choice.

And waiting in the bitter cold at 25th & 6th Avenue is something I don’t want to repeat!At 1:00am I arrived at the Hyatt Place with a letter from the Four Points to bill them for my stay. That however didn’t stop the front desk chap from whispering to me that my credit card was declined. Three times in my one night stay I had to clarify just who is paying. After all, the Four Points already banked my payment.The HP's room is not large but well put together. Modern, comfortable and clean. Features include a couch, king size bed, closet, safe, refrigerator, coffee maker (note: I found the part where water is to be poured to be dirty and needed a clean, which I did and then enjoyed a fine cup o’ joe), a desk, plenty of drawer space, good lighting and a modern bathroom.Brilliant location if you want to be in Midtown. Five minute walk from Macy’s. I lie. It’s UNDER 5 mins. And quiet. The hotel is in a small street and while close to Penn Station and Herald Sq., but you wouldn't know it from the tranquility of the hotel.This time I traveled without a mobile device and found the three desktop computers in the lobby to be very useful.The b/fast was great: eggs, cereals, fruits, breads, yogurt and pastries. Thank you Mr Four Points for introducing me to the HP! If you honoured my reservation with your hotel I would never have found this wonderfully located, quiet, nicely put together hotel. Oh and THANK YOU (not) SO MUCH for calling me ahead of my arrival telling me YOU ARE SOLD OUT so that I wouldn't waste time, money and energy getting to your hotel. Only to besent to the HP!

We also wanted to be between 35th and 40th Street because of a few commitments we had in the area -- and we found the prefect place. Not fancy, not an especially large room, certainly no serious luxury services. But still the perfect place if what you want is a specific location, clean with more than ample space, at a price that doesn't break the bank around the holiday season.So, given its location just off 5th Avenue, on W. 36th Street, there is the Hyatt Place Hotel. What makes it something special you might wonder? The Hotel is just a few years old, and is Hyatt's entry into the fewer amenities, lower price hotel category, but, at the same time, maintains the quality that Hyatt is known for -- and Hyatt has done it here. We found our room on the 20th floor to be perfectly laid out, and what it lacked in square footage, it made up for in quality space utilization -- not to mention a 42 inch flat screen TV. The room itself had a couch, king size bed, small closet, safe, refrigerator, coffee maker, a desk, plenty of drawer space, ample lighting, black-out shades,free Wi-FI, and an ample free breakfast (only wish they served NY style bagels). The room was spotless, with sheets and towels changed on request (the Green option). The Wall Street Journal was delivered on weekdays, and there were three monitors in the Lobby for Boarding Passes, etc. So what else is there? Service. The Front Desk people were well trained in terms of eye contact and the use of your name -- and were friendly and very accommodating. There was always someone in the Lobby to help with any questions, and even help with luggage and calling for Car Service. I asked for a slightly later checkout -- no problem.Oh yes, one other thing -- the air conditioning/heating system. More often than not, many NY hotels are in older buildings that have been renovated a few times. Many of these hotels are in the real ""Luxe"" category, but still have window air conditioners/heaters. We've stayed in several, and found that they are usually very noisy, and regardless of black-out shades, make comfortable sleeping a serious challenge. In one instance, we were in a really upper scale hotel and asked that the air conditioning unit be changed out because it had clearly had seen better times and was very noisy. ""Sure"" was the answer, ""but I can't guarantee it would be any less noisy as the replacement unit would be of the same vintage as the one in your room,"" In any case, since this Hyatt Place is so new, they have absolutely noiseless central air conditioning/heating -- leading to the best nights sleep you could possibly have outside of your own home.Next time we are going to the ""Big Apple"", the Hyatt Place Hotel on W. 36th Street will be our address.","Miami, Florida",10,5.0

This trip I was on a budget, so I cashed in my Hyatt points and stayed here. The location is a good one: particularly convenient to theatre district and restaurants. The room, although small and really not sized for two people, is well laid out with everything a single occupant needs, including a coffee maker, sofa and desk. The room was extraordinarily quiet despite all the kids staying here, and I was very pleased about that given I am a light sleeper.The attitude of the hotel staff members I encountered was excellent. A very warm and friendly welcome greeted me on upon my arrival. When I discovered there was no caffeinated coffee in my room, someone came up with a full bag of very good coffee as well several filters and suggested I improvise, given that the regular room-sized coffee packets were not available, which was very helpful. The maid service was excellent as well. Also, the folks who serviced the breakfast room were very nice.The negatives (and not strong ones) are that the hot (and cold) breakfast, which is quite good and generous, is served buffet style in a large room off the lobby, and it gets very crowded at times. Also, the hotel has only two elevators, and the waits can be long in the morning.In summary, I think this is a good mid-priced option in Manhattan, and provides a lot of value for your hotel dollar.","Los Angeles, CA",20,4.0

Our well-appointed room (2407) was much larger than many standard double rooms in Manhattan in this hotel category. One appreciates the ample quiet space up high after being outside with throngs of tourists, workers, and busy streets and sometimes overwhelming auto traffic and noise. Kudos to reliable and talented maid service. Included hot/cold breakfast buffet and coffee bar was much appreciated, featuring tasty brealfast egg muffins and assorted breakfast staples. Plenty of everything just kept flowing from the tireless staff. Clean, fresh-tasting, with CNN and free newspapers, and worth always waking up early for. WiFi signal is strong and allows HD video streaming in rooms. Huge TV in room has numerous A-V connections, but we didn't use them. Just watched regular cable channels which were somewhat deficient, a minor issue. However, more significantly, few to no yellow taxis drive by the hotel, and hotel staff appointed to assist failed to secure a taxi for us. Hotel has negotiated high flat rates with car service(s), so since we preferred a regular taxi to ""save"" money, we were on our own. In cold weather (temps under 40), flagging down taxis is a challenge, as everyone wants to drive instead of walk. There are surprisingly some very good restaurants right nearby, such as 5 Boro Burger and Szechuan Gourmet. Plus Macy's is a must-see, and don't forget about its restaurants and food bars inside.

A big plus is that breakfast buffet is included; saves you from searching for a breakfast locale every morning and spending too much money. That said, the breakfast buffet can be a bit hectic and overcrowded, and staff can't always keep up with re-filling items in a timely manner. But there's a Starbucks and deli next door if you want some variety. Like I said - if you want a luxury hotel, go elsewhere.

Rooms were good. They are not as large as the standard hyatt place ( which are very generous rooms) but are roomy by New York standards. I like having the extra sofa. The fridge is always a nice amenity. There is a microwave in the bar area and you could heat up leftovers if you wanted. Bathroom is nice. Beds comfortable. No one yet has a good pillow, but theirs are fine. We had a view out to the Empire State Building and that was cool, but I don't think I would pay extra. You have to duck down even on the lower floors to see the top. Breakfast is fine, if crowded toward the end. Wifi worked fine. Location is great. We were on the 10th floor and noise was not an issue. Very close to tourist locations but not right in the middle of the mayhem. 1 block from subway. Easy to get uptown or downtown. Neighborhood is busy without the charm of lower manhattan but lots of restaurants and stores nearby. Staff was great. Friendly and accommodating.

It looks nothing like that! That photo is of another hotel and is therefore very misleading. The NYC Hyatt Midtown South Is a tall narrow building structurally sandwiched between two other tall, narrow buildings.The location itself is fantastic! Turn right out of the hotel and 30 seconds later you're on 5th Avenue. For my needs and interests, the location was perfect - 5 stars versus the 4.1 stars I 'd give the Distrikt Hotel, where I also stayed during this trip!Be aware, however: there is major construction going on next to the hotel. Not the building immediately adjoining it but the building next to that. And boy, is it loud - and nor does it look like a short-term project!! Ensure you ask for a quiet room in advance of your arrival if that's a concern for you. It was for me, but thankfully my room (#1204) at the back of the hotel meant I wasn't particularly disturbed by it by during my three night stay. Obviously there was normal city traffic noise, and a bit of background drilling/banging - but you'd fully expect that in NYC. However, the price I paid for asking for a quiet was a 'view' facing straight into another building. The fact the outside of my window was so dirty was an aid in terms of providing a bit of privacy(!), but whenever I was in my room I also needed to pull down the blind, which meant restricting the daylight a little.I booked a studio room with sofa. It was tiny. Having just checked out of the spacious room at the Distrikt, I really felt it.... I found it too small really.... I definitely wouldn't book that category room again for what was originally* priced at US 279/night inclusive of breakfast + taxes. The bed was large and comfortable though. And I was really pleased to see a very good sized, empty fridge which was greatly appreciated: so many hotels - including the Distrikt - pack out their fridges with products leaving zero room for anything you may want to buy and keep cold! Of course, you can often just remove the hotel products if you want, but it they're operating a drawer configuration, every time you remove something it clocks up as ""consumed"" on your account! Thankfully no such issues at the Hyatt Midtown South and with the blistering summer heat I was pleased to be able to buy big bottles of water and coke and keep them cold in my room.There's no kettle in the room and none available to borrow. There's a small (one cup at a time) coffee machine in the room which Front Desk told me I can get hot water from - but clearly the water generated from it stinks/tastes of coffee and I loathe coffee, so that was no use to me! Reception were very happy to fill up cups for me from the kitchen but I felt really bad asking them to do it for me, and would have preferred being able to do it myself....Other reviewers have mentioned the slow lifts.... It really wasn't an issue for me though; I was on the 10th floor and I used the situation as a good opportunity to get a big fitter and use the stairs! :-)Breakfast was a very welcome, complimentary inclusion and really adequate considering this is only what I'd say is a 3 star hotel (in the same bracket for me as a Holiday Inn Express, Ibis, that sort of thing). The dining room itself is very plain and functional.... But the staff were very sweet and pleasant, which I appreciated. In truth, I'm used to expansive, 'all-singing, all-dancing' Asian hotel buffets which of course this isn't, but for for what it is, I was pleasantly surprised: plenty of different cereals to choose from; big jugs of cold fruit juices and milk (low-fat, soya and full-fat); fresh fruit; a small selection of tasty pastries; and at least two hot breakfast muffin options (eg cheese and spinach, and bacon and cheese) on the hot plate section. I got there at 7 am each day when it was fairly quiet. It gets really crowded and akin to a full-on ""bun fight"" later!! I saw people grabbing loads of stuff to take back to their rooms.... * Overall: if I had paid the original price of US 279/night I'd have felt very niggled. Although the location is fab, the bedroom was just too small and the orientation of my room was poor (albeit avoiding the construction site!). However I was given an adjusted price US 200/night, which was the going rate on their website the day I checked in. That made it a better proposition....","London, United Kingdom",42,3.0

Our bed was very comfortable. As this being New York, the rooms are slightly smaller than the usual Hyatt Place rooms. As long as you can get the kids to stay organized with their suitcases, there is enough room. We were on the 17th floor and our room was quiet. Since this hotel was full, the wait for the elevator was a little long at times. The free breakfast was better than other places that offer free breakfast and there were many options.

It was all good, until I stepped in the shower and realized the position of the shower head was such that it would not only flood the bathroom but also the room! Really strange experience. It took half an hour for room service to provide us with towels to soak the water and then another 2 hours for the maintenance guy to arrive to figure our problem. The staff was extremely slow but they tried their best to help. My husband booked through his points and since we were disappointed with the whole thing they gave us a night free.The location is amazing, always buzzing with tourists and its walking distance to all the hotspots, shopping, restaurants etc. We ate breakfast in the hotel and enjoyed the selection at the buffet - nothing special the usual bread, muffins, oatmeal, juices, fruits for us vegetarians. There can be a wait line for breakfast as well as the elevators. As mentioned above we drove and weren't planning to use it during our stay. We found a cheaper alternative to the hotel parking opposite the hotel, best way to find options is by using google maps.Might come back to stay in a standard room mainly for the location.","Seattle, Washington",35,3.0

We are a family of six (6) and this room fit use well and cozy :) I must admit that this is our first stay in NYC so this room seems small to us but from what I've read this is good sized (esp for the location and price). We love the location. It ended up being much closer to key locations and attractions like The Empire State Building, Time Square, Broadway and Shopping. We also bought unlimited 7 days Metro Passes and every location was a quick train or bus ride away. I have to agree with earlier comments about the morning elevator situation. It's very difficult to take the elevator in the mornings. With the crush of people checking in and out along with the staff having to use the same elevator it makes sense that there's a long wait. Luckily we are on the 5th floor so we just took the stairs in the AM. Ok that brings me to breakfast. We sometimes just slept in so late we missed it but as it nears 9am there is a crush of people in the dinning area and yes food does run out but they quickly restock even when it's close to 9am. There were these two people who has the arduous task of taking care of the buffet areas and they hustled. There was a young Spanish girl and guy and anything I asked about or for they always had a smile and a quick turn around. I do feel they need more hands on deck for breakfast since the great staff is being overwhelmed by poor design and layout of the dining area. One plus was that we were free to take our food outside to eat or even to our room. The food was pretty good and they had many choices. There is a microwave in the dinning area that can be used throughout the day which came in handy for reheating leftovers. Parking sucks but we are in NYC so that's to be expected. We drove here from Florida in our SUV and just note the base is $35 but for an SUV it's $45 per day (ouch since we're here for 7 days). All in all the rooms are clean and beds are comfortable which are my personal top two needs...I would certainly recommend this hotel. Lovely hotel with a great location. Pleas note that I'm really not a fussy or high maintenance travel/person. For the price point this property is very good.

When we were finally acknowledged we were told the cleaning crew was running slow and that we wouldn't get our high level room anytime in the near future, and that we would still have to wait past the official check in time to get our room. I've stayed in motels that have had better customer service. To top it all off the breakfast served you guessed it...rotten eggs.

Our previous experiences have been fantastic. The entire staff of this Hyatt Place need to visit their colleagues in Nashville. They know how to do it right. We were in Nashville during CMA, the hotel was at capacity, and still the hotel was well staffed, very friendly and efficient. Not so in NYC. The complementary breakfast in Hyatt Place is typically fantastic. The breakfast here is a nightmare. There is a consistent line of 10-30 people. They need to re-do the buffet so it is not a single line (again see how Nashville does it). Breakfast ends here at 9:00 a.m. Every other Hyatt Place had more generous hours. Every morning we have been at breakfast around 8:00 a.m. (an hour before they are scheduled to close) and they are already out of yogurt, oatmeal, cereal and most of the coffee dispensers are empty. I ask if they are bringing out more food and the response is that once it's gone, it's gone. I guess that's too bad for the 100 plus people I see come in after us. They are terribly understaffed. There are 2-3 people working when there should be at least 6. People can not find places to sit and there is not staff assisting with bussing tables so they can turn over more quickly. If you are a family, plan to sit on the floor or go back to your room if you want to sit together. The other major complaint is the elevator. It takes at least 5-7 minutes to get an elevator and, again, if you're a family, once the elevator arrives, it is full of people and can not accommodate your party. We have begun taking the steps 15 floors because it is quicker. The rooms are nice and work well for a family. I am trying to think of more positive feedback but nothing is coming to me.

We had a room on the 21st floor with a view of the Empire State Building. We are pretty heavy sleepers so didn't have trouble with noise (and we were fairly high up). I heard some faint street noise when I woke up a couple times - but fell right back to sleep. We were a little concerned about the elevator due to reading prior reviews but didn't have any problems. Maybe waited about 5 minutes one morning around breakfast time - otherwise no waits beyond a few minutes, if that. Room was clean and large by NYC standards - there was a small couch, desk with chair and small refrigerator besides the king bed and dresser. Breakfast had a good variety - some hot items as well as the normal cold items you would expect. Breakfast room was busy - if you have a family - it may be hard to sit together at certain times, however for 2 people - we could always squeeze in somewhere - even at the bar! There are some computers available in the lobby to use to print out boarding passes. The location is absolutely ideal - you can walk to the Times Square area, Macy's is right across the street and one of the busiest (several lines) Subway stations (34th street/Herald Square) is a block and a half away. (use the 35th street NE exit to be closest to the hotel).

The cleanliness was excellent, but the closet was ridiculously small , and if deigned better a nice comfy chair and bigger closet would have worked much better. My WiFi was excellent but my friend could only get it in his room if he were jammed up against the door, The Free breakfast ( unusual for NYC) is a bit of a bun fight , probably because they stop it at 9 am which is too early. The only other criticism, is that there are only two elevators, and it seems the staff have no service lift, so i waited up to 8 minutes to go from the 12th Floor to the lobby.

We arrived at 1.30 and were able to check in straight away which was great. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was a good size, had a full comfy Hyatt king bed, decent sized TV and reasonable sized bath room. Unlike some of the New York hotels you see on here, where they have chipped paint work, or have been decorated but you can see not very well, this Hyatt Place is new and clean and and the design is modern. Also, the bathroom had fairly good lighting, which can often be a bugbear of mine. The breakfast was fine, nothing special, but good enough considering it's included in the price. The breakfast room is not the biggest, so getting there earlier rather than later is advisable. We were on the 11th floor at the back and could just see the empire state building out of the window. We didn't have any traffic noise, but the dozens of airconditioning units outside are pretty noisy. Also what proved to be a bit noisy was our in-room fridge, although we had a rather large bottle of water in there. There are only 2 lifts in the building covering 26 floors (not even a service lift), so around breakfast time it can take a while for the lift to come. We walked down twice. Location-wise it's great - we walked as far north as 91st in upper east and as far south as Soho. It's very close to the Empire State, Macy's, Times Square, Madison Sq.

In the morning 'rush hour' the elevator that finally came was often full and I needed to wait even longer!2 The breakfast is sub-par compared to other Hyatt Place offerings.

We booked online for 3 nights through Westjet Vacations as part of a package; no hassles and excellent value.Hyatt Place's location was perfect for what we wanted. Situated in the heart of midtown, we were able to walk to everything - Times Square, Empire State Building and many more. It's also very easy to catch a subway or taxi in this area too.We loved the consistently super-friendly service at Hyatt. Everytime we walked in the door it was like being welcomed back into our own home. Smiles always make people feel good and staff were very helpful; able to give us a map and directions when needed.The included breakfast was excellent value. It was a fantastic way to start each day with a great range of fresh food, coffee and newspapers - perfect to fuel up with before a long day. Super-friendly breakfast staff also helped get each morning off to a good start!We used the business centre multiple times and found it really modern, clean, efficient and didn't have to wait to use it. This would no doubt be excellent for business professionals staying at the Hyatt.Our room was bigger than I expected for New York standards and was always clean, receiving regular clean sheets and efficient room service. I hear the tap water in rooms is drinkable with nothing wrong, despite its cloudy consistency. We opted to buy bottled water during our stay though, which was easily purchased from one of the many nearby convenience stores. Our bed was incredibly comfy!Our room faced W36th Street and it took us a while to get accustomed to the street noise at night. It is New York though, so we expected this somewhat. The loud banging of nearby room doors did actually rattle our heads a little sometimes which was a bit unexpected. The waiting time to catch the elevators was a bit tedious as mentioned in other reviews. We didn't have a tight schedule opposed to business people, but I can imagine this annoying some.We would definitely recommend Hyatt Place Midtown South to anyone staying in New York. An excellent hotel with excellent service and only minor hiccups. I look forward to our next stay at Hyatt Place!","Tasmania, Australia",85,5.0

Called the hotel, the phone operator couldn't locate the person responsible (Maria was her name), and asked me to call again. I called in the morning, and the reception told me that she (Maria) did not arrive yet. Called again later, he said to leave my phone number and she'll call back. Called the day after complaining that she never called back, he promised he'll personally follow up with her.Of course, Maria did not respond despite my several phone calls for 3-4 days.Luckily enough, i was connecting via NY and i decided to drop by the hotel in person. The guys at the reception were sympathetic with me and tried contacting Maria on the radio. After waiting for 10 mins in the lobby, she responded back that she has no sweater or scarf in the lost & found registered under my room number and that she was busy in a meeting and couldn't see me!!For God's sake, some respect!... the polite guy on the reception (Thomas) respectfully apologised to me for this agonising encounter and promised me he'll have her call me when her meeting was over.

Our room was very good-sized by New York standards, and it was set up efficiently. We had a (VERY comfortable) king bed, sofa, desk, large TV and huge window. The bathroom was nice but no counter space by the sink.... a lot of my toiletries ended up on the desk. Thomas at the front desk was very helpful, and when I told him we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary, he offered us 2 free beverages and a room on a high floor for a better view (but it was still was not good - on the other side of the building, we could have seen the Empire State Building but we looked over buildings and water tanks!) The complimentary skillet breakfast and Starbucks coffee were a huge bonus. The housekeeping staff did a great job each day, and the front desk and bell staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. The only downside was that there are only 2 elevators, and during peak hours they were crowded and slow.But the best thing about this hotel is the location. It's close to several subway stops that will take you north or south; walking distance to Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Central Park.

You really can't argue with the location; though the street it's on isn't the swankiest place I've ever set foot, you can get virtually anywhere in Manhattan in 15-20 minutes as the hotel is conveniently a three-minute walk to Herald Square station, where several subway lines intersect. Rooms are very serviceable, and borderline ""nice""; they feel new and clean, and have nice couches for lounging. They're equipped with fridges, which is a huge plus. I understand the higher floors have nice views; I was on 9 so was looking across the street into an office building. I didn't find the street too noisy, unless someone got out of a cab and then the horns would start blaring (welcome to New York). Also, I got a Wall Street Journal delivered to my room each morning, which was a nice touch. Internet was a bit slow, but free. Breakfast was very good, with hot sandwiches, cottage cheese, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal etc. And the breakfast staff work really hard to keep the place clean and stocked, which I appreciated.Front desk service is a bit raw: this is where you remember that no, this ain't the Plaza, it's the Place.

The only complaint I have is with the car service that was called by one of the employees to take us to the airport. We left our baggage at the hotel since we had a flight later in the day and the gentleman that took our luggage ask how we were getting to the airport. When we told him we were taking a taxi, he said ""Oh no, let me call you a car service, you'll be much more comfortable and it's not that much more expensive."" He told us the car would be no more than $50 to LGA. We had paid $35 for the taxi when we arrived from the airport so we figured for $15 more, why not go ahead and get the car. When we arrived at the airport, the driver told us it would be $60. When we questioned why we were quoted no more that $50, he said that it was because he had gone through the tunnel and paid a toll. The taxi also went through the tunnel and charged us a toll. I felt this was very shady. I don't know if the Hyatt employee is aware that the driver he called is doing this, but if he is, he should be made to get an honest quote to guest before he encourages them to let him call them a car service. Other than this, our stay was very enjoyable and I found the staff, location, rooms, and comfort of beds to be perfect.","Richmond, Virginia",7,4.0

The internet worked well. Basic cable essentially, no DirecTV selection of multiple channels. I wanted to watch the Daily Show but no Comedy Central in the package. A small quibble, I know. The only significant problem I had here is that most of the time during my six days here the water from the sink faucet was a milky color. The engineer couldn't solve it and brought a couple of bottles of mineral water. The front desk was made aware of the problem and offered to change rooms but I didn't want to repack and unpack. They should have restocked my room with bottled water every day but did not. When I checked out and told the front desk they shouldn't book anyone else in the room (1808) until the water problem is fixed the clerk said she wasn't aware there was a problem but rang the engineer immediately. So there's certainly a lack of coordination, especially for a guest with a significant number of Hyatt stays (OK, I'm platinum but not diamond level). Even though I was on a high floor, I could hear people yelling on the street from time to time. But midtown Manhattan is not Big Sur. All that said, I would probably not object to staying here again.

Very friendly staff at check-in in an inviting and cozy lobby.The room was fantastic, very clean and nicely decorated. The designers made good use of the smaller spaces in this building and makes it feel more roomy. The amenities of the room were great, from the fridge to the specific TV ports to connect your own electronics. Very convenient!Our complimentary breakfast was also a nice perk, with a great spread of dishes to chose from, all pretty delicious. It was great to finish breakfast then walk right outside to Herald Square. The hotel's location was swell, close to major attractions and all major subway lines. It's right off the main avenue too, so it's not particularly loud.We encountered no issues at this wonderful little hotel and would recommend it across the boards!","Pasadena, California",23,5.0

I like Hyatts but had never stayed at a Hyatt Place. The front desk staff was pleasant and check-in went quickly. I asked for a room on a high floor and was given one on 17. It was quiet and larger than I anticipated. There was room for a bed, couch, ottoman, desk and chair and drawers. The bathroom had enough space for cosmetics and travel accessories. Everything was clean and the bathroom was spotless. The mattress was very comfortable; lots of pillows, towels and washcloths were provided. I appreciated the small safe in the closet for valuables. Iron, ironing board and full-size hair dryer in the room along with a small refrigerator. I had read the comments about the crowded breakfast room so I arrived at 8 am and found a table with no problem. There are also 2 long counters with seating. There are lots of selections for breakfast and plenty of food. The dark roast coffee was delicious. There was a wait for the elevators sometimes but not overly long. There is free wi-fi and 3 public computers in the lobby. The location is excellent--between 5th and 6th Avenues--within walking distance to shopping, theaters, restaurants and Penn Station; subways are nearby. There were only 2 negatives. The lighting is too bright and harsh and there is no way to dim it. The wall lamps over the couch turn on/off together; they can't be operated individually. The wall lamps over the bed can be turned on/off individually but can't be dimmed. There are no bedside lamps; you have to get out of bed to turn off the lights. It was apparent the lighting system wasn't designed with the guest in mind. As a result, there was too much glare on the TV to see it without turning off all the lights except for a small desk lamp. The other negative is that the TV is not good quality. The picture was dark on some stations even with the lights off and there was no way to lighten it.I would have given this hotel a 5 except for the problems with the lighting and TV. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it for the traveler on a budget who wants a centrally located, adequately sized room in a high quality hotel chain.","Albany, New York",3,4.0

I booked using Hyatt Gold Passport points, and so I don't actually remember what I would've paid in cash. I do remember it being very reasonable for New York. I had a street facing room which despite other reviews was not as noisy as one would think. Aside from the occasional horn in the middle of the night I slept pretty well on the 15th floor. The elevators were a bit slow and crowded, but it is a tall hotel with a small footprint. I imagine they did the best they could given the special limitations.Complimentary breakfast: I must say that this was probably the one of the best complimentary breakfast spreads I've seen in all my travels while staying at hotels of various levels (Motel 6 up to W Hotels). They had 2 different types of scrambled eggs (normal and some sort of southwestern), French toast, sausage, fruit, pastries, oatmeal, and cold cereal. Now for the negative:I will preface this by stating that I grew up just outside of NYC, and currently live in Boston. As a result I am somewhat familiar with how pricey garage parking can be. As the hotel does not offer their own parking, they have a deal with a local garage for a $35 per 24 hour period. This seemed very reasonable, and helped me in deciding to drive vs taking the Amtrak down. I dropped my car off at 11:30am Saturday, and picked it up at 1:30pm Sunday (26 hours). Upon paying for parking I was informed that I would be charged for TWO 24 hour periods. The garage clerk said to take my complaint up with the hotel who also explained it's the deal they have with the garage, and only apologized that it was not made completely clear upon check-in at the hotel. I understand that the garage's hourly rate is just as pricey as the daily rate, but I imagine I am not the first person to be blind sided when picking up their car expecting to pay for one 24 hour period + 2 hours. Please be warned, and plan accordingly if you intend to drive to this hotel.","Boston, Massachusetts",3,4.0

We were approached by other guest that were having the same issues as well.We inquired about moving rooms and were told we could do so. On our way to switch rooms we got on to the elevator in the lobby and when the door closed the elevator got stuck. We became trapped with 10 adults in a 5x5 elevator for the next hour. The experience was horrible. When we were first trapped we were able to talk thru the elevator doors to the front desk staff and the manager on duty.After the first 10 minutes no one from the hotel was able to give a time line as to when we would be rescued. As the minutes ticked on the manager on duty said she was going to call the company who serviced the elevator instead of calling the fire department as we had requested. Many of the guests in the elevator were starting to panic and felt faint due to the close quarters. Everyone was trying to stay calm but the feeling of being trapped was overwhelming. Luckily we were able to get phone reception and call the FDNY on our own, and were freed from the the elevator no more than 5 minutes after they arrived. After we were rescued the assistant manager told several guest that the Hyatt would not be charging us because of incident .That seemed the very least the hotel could do under the circumstances. However on the morning we were to check out a bill was placed under our door.When we questioned the manager she told us there was a miscommunication and she was not willing to fullfill her inital offer to take care of the room charges. She said she did not have the authority . A nationwide hotel chain opperating in Manhattan on the weekend before Christmas had no general manager on duty and the assistant manager was clearly not equipped to deal with the very serious issues on hand.

Check-in was fast and I was assigned a better room than the one I booked. Ask them for anything from a map, to dinner advise, to calling for a cab.

This place had very good blackout shades.This is the first hotel I’ve stayed at with complimentary breakfast where you might wait in line to be seated. (This is a good thing.) If you arrive less than 15minutes before breakfast ends, it will be crowed and you will wait in a short line. Luz is the hostess and handles this with a smile.Food wise there’s the usual cold cereal, pastry, toast, bagels, juice and coffee. There is also hot oatmeal with raisins, granola, and other toppings, a mixed fruit cobbler and grape fruit that my wife just loved! They also serve on a rotating basis: egg, cheese, and pesto on a English muffin, scrambled eggs, cheese omelet, and waffles. I read comments about how long it takes to catch an elevator since there are only two. There are 26 floors in the hotel and I could see how you could wait for an elevator if you are on a low numbered floor. (Especially if breakfast is closing in 10 minutes.). Personally, I was on the 21th floor and do not recall people not being able to enter our elevator as we were heading down. The location is great, 1 ½ blocks from the subway.

In this case I spoke to a very nice supervisor name Thomas before leaving to make sure I had two beds and there would be three people. I also spoke to Lauren to reconfirm, even though I did not go through a third party and went with hyatt, I still had to make sure. I am not sure why no one brought linens because when I called for toiletries they were delivered in a timely manner. As for the complaints on elevators we had no problems, as for other reviews on the breakfast, we thought for free breakfast it was good how can we complain there were two different types of eggsdelicious link sausage, either french toast or pancake, oatmeal, assorted cereals assorted danish,bagels, muffins, assorted fruits, yogurt, granola, assorted juices, milk tea, coffee, for free breakfast I was very grateful. and if you wanted to take to your room you could take it up with the plate. there was always seating the entrees were always replenished the crew does. fine job in dining. out of the three hotels we stayed in during this east coast trip, philly, wilmington and hyatt my family and I hands down agreed hyatt had the most comfortable bedding. We have been to many hyatts, but because we were told new york was expensive and rooms smaller, we were still satisfied. we found the housekeeping to be neat and clean, the hotel walking distance to many places and also near penn station. the staff and management were nice I did not think anyone was rude, we had met nice people again like Thomas, Lauren, Michelle, Raul, ladies in the breakfast room and the elderly gentlemen who stand behind the fridge section with juices and snacks, sandwiches, pasteries, candies, not sure what their roles are they wear a suit, but thy were still pleasant. hotel is new and clean. we did have issues twice with our keys not working but that was resolved quickly and my daughter said they were very apologetic and nice about it. The only thing con would be when I asked about transport to jfk, they said there is no contact number for yellow cab, but they have contract with private cars and it would be sixty two dollars cash or sixty eight dollars charge, I later on found out after I returned home that there are a lot cheaper transportation with other private cars,I also was not given a reciept, but I did not ask for one either since we were just trying to get all our bags out our driver was nice, but he kept looking ata his phone I dont think it was for directions, because he would know the route so I will not use them next times. My fault did not do my homework before leaving hawaii on the trsnsport back to airport just assumed we could call the cablike all the other hotels, but hyatt said cabs had no number to call. other than that cant think of anything bad to say about this hotel. I feel we as travelers have to also do our homework and if you cant call overseas then at least email prior to arriving and document all your request, because you just cant always trust those third party bookings. and its nice to familiarize yourself with the staff before meeting them in person again by phone or email. thats my suggestion to all travelers just felt bad for the party from milan. anyway thank you hyatt for another great experience and special mahalo(thank you in hawaiian) to Thomas, Puala, Lauren. hope you guys enjoyed the goodies from hawaii. also giving excellent for value because we used points and anniversary and with free breakfast I say the value was worth one hundred stars. oh we also got a room where we could see part of the empire state building very close just right around the corner I think we had room 1203 with two beds. elevators were always ok for us and wait time not long at all also quiet as room is in the corner. but pull your shades since it is also directly acoss another building. and if you are platinum you get goodies from there little snack bar they give you a card.","Mililani, Hawaii",95,5.0

We booked on Booking.com a room for 3 ADULT PEOPLE. When we arrived at the hotel, after a long flight from Milan, we had a bad surprise: our room had only one double bed and one sofa, not even a sofa bed! You can see it in the pictures: it was a small couch (I am 1,75 m tall and I could not stretch out my legs!) and of course there were no sheets. I went to the reception, sure that there was a mistake, but they told me that that was the room that I booked. I insisted so they told me that I had to call Booking.com; we did it and they told me the same thing. The worst thing is that they already had this problem, because one of the two girls at the reception said to the other one: always the same problem with the 3 people room on booking.com! The hotel tried to blame Booking because they have been not clear, and Booking was trying to do the same with the hotel. The only thing I know is that I paid for 3 ADULTS, more than 1.600 $, to sleep one week on a couch!Another woman was having the same problem, but she was with her two children so maybe they managed to sleep in one bed. That was not the case for us, and I repeat that I paid one room for three Adults. There was no way to change the room, and they asked me if I wanted to pay to get a single room!!! Luckily, one of the two girls at the reception was helpful (the other one was even rude) and she managed to cancel my reservation, and we got a room for 3 (that means with two double beds) at the Holiday Inn next door. We had to stay at the Hyatt Place only one (terrible) night, and they charged us € 308 for sleeping on a sofa. We asked to have at least some sheets for the couch, and they never arrived.

There are a few qualifiers, it's NYC so, there are always going to be people but it's not the craziness and all the tourists that you have in Times Square.  However, you are just a few blocks from Macy's and Herald Square which can get crowded but 36th street where the hotel is located is relatively quiet. There is a Best Westen and Holiday Inn on either side of this property, which was interesting, but all 3 hotels are ""small"" in a good way, by NYC standards. We chose this location for a couple of reasons. We wanted to explore NYC and have a good base to do it from. It's conveniently located, there are subways nearby but everything is so walkable in NY and its less that a 30 minute walk to Union Square. About the same to the Highline park. Our main reason for staying here is we wanted a smaller hotel outside of the usual tourist areas. This was a perfect choice for us. Once you are through the doors, in the lobby or in your room its very peaceful. We have also stayed in other Hyatt Place hotels around the country, so we had some familiarity in what to expect. However, while the rooms are very comfortable and this is a new hotel, the rooms are a bit smaller than say the Hyatt Place at Salt Lake City Airport. But then again, this is NYC and chances are you aren't going to be spending too much time in your room. So, even with smaller rooms you still have your king size bed, large screen tv, free internet etc. I should add that they do a great job with the size of the room. There are also the usual Hyatt Place amenities, like a nice sitting area in the lobby, there is another area outside, which is a nice touch, as well as a pantry and free breakfast. Just a word about that: there are plenty of options to buy stuff, there is a store just a few doors down, a Duane Reade drugstore around the corner which has everything and there are restaurants on the same street as the hotel and all over NYC. But if you forgot to get anything and didn't want to go out, its nice to have stuff available at the front desk.The breakfast is what you might expect and it comes with your stay. So, its convenient and easy. Not too many ""healthy"" options, and given that this is New York City, you would think they would have better bagels. At best these are generic food service bagels. Other than that its a nice breakfast area, it's clean and lots of seating. Before staying here, I noted that some of the reviews mentioned only 2 elevators and some other complaints. We never had to wait for an elevator. Our room was spotless. Staff at the front desk was friendly, and we enjoyed our stay and will be back again.","Miami Beach, Florida",150,5.0

We had to make an impromptu trip to NYC and did not have a reservation. About 7:00 pm in the evening we reserved a room mainly because of the proximity to the 34th St subway. Expected only a reasonable room for sleeping but were happy to find many positives that will keep us coming back. We primarily booked the room because of reasonable price. When we were so well received by the staff on arrival I sensed we were in for something special. Booking into the room was a breeze. Staff was helpful and courteous with all of or questions. The room was more than adequate for our needs. Great king bed, full couch. 42"" TV, desk with computer access, free wi-fi, nice bathroom with huge shower and every feature we'd expect for a three night stay. Granted ther are only two elevators but we never waited more than two minutes to get access and to our room. One of the best parts of this hotel was the breakfast service. I was expecting the usual coffee, cereal, and bagel type service you usually get at a holiday inn express. Not here. They prepare hot items like eggs, sausage, breakfast sandwiches along with fresh fruit, cereals, oatmeal and Danish. It's more like a restaurant that comps you for your meal. Couldn't have been better. I've read some previous reviews that criticized this hotel and I'm wondering if these people stayed at the same place that my wife and I did? The only item that we couldn't find or wasn't in the bathroom was a blow dryer. I'm sure if we asked they would have had one for us immediately. For the location, services, cleanliness, courteous staff and price I can't think of a better place to stay in NYC. We've stayed in much higher priced NYC hotels with much less to offer.

I know another room in the hotel also had the same smell, because I asked to be moved from it (15th floor). In my new room, I was awoken very early in the morning by the alarm in the room - housekeeping should have turned it off when turning over the room. Also, the iron was literally broken. After heating it and starting to iron my shirt, the bottom metal which gets hot was cracked and broken off and it damaged my shirt as I started ironing it. I had to wear the previous day's sweaty shirt to work. I called down and asked for a new iron, and it took about 15 minutes of waiting. Too late at that point had to run out the door with an old sweaty shirt on, and a clean, but damaged shirt - after being awoken very early in the morning by the alarm, which was in the stinky (and tiny) room. Also, my first room that i was given (15th floor) was facing a an apartment building directly across from us, who were so close they could see us in the room. Had to pull the black out shades down for any level of privacy. The room is SOOO tiny, that you WILL get claustrophobic in there - even if you don't suffer from Claustrophobia.So, to stay there, you could not have the shades up to get any sun in the room, unless you were fully dressed and prepared to be stared at from across the street.

Went 30 minutes before closing and didn't have to wait. It's a combo of continental food and some hot food. I felt it was worth eating elsewhere with so many quick options in NYC. I did not try their other food that you can order. The rooms provide a pod coffee maker and Twinning's tea. Rooms in this hotel are great. They are the size we had staying in Paris, which makes sense. So they are somewhat small, but you won't be hanging in your room anyway. Nice views from higher up and not too bad on the noise. Great tv with hookups, comfy bed, and even a couch! Fitness center was just okay. They have a few cardio things and some weights - not heavy enough for males that lift regularly but you could probably get by.Best thing about this place is the staff. All are younger - competent and upbeat. When we left one of the front office guys actually went down the street to catch us a taxi. And I loved the maid service. She didn't throw out anything we wanted to keep. She didn't try to rearrange our clothes! Always gave us appropriate number of fresh towels!

This hotel is new and it's location can't be beat for tourists and business travelers. As others have mentioned, transportation is no problem to anywhere in the city from here. Subway station is around the corner and taxis are easily hailed from 6th or 5th ave.We stayed only one night (Saturday) and the room with a pull out sofa is spacious for NYC. Seems like the corner rooms are not as spacious and may not have pull out sofas. Even so, it's not a problem if it's just for a night or two. The room itself is clean and bed was comfy. Lighting is good although it's definitely fluorescent white bright. (No dimmers)The staff is friendly and accommodating. Front desk to bell hop to breakfast attendants. Speaking of breakfast it's included in the rate. A simple buffet style with hot and cold options. Table seating could be problematic but the staff tries their best to manage it (people should read the sign for ""wait to be seated""). If you don't want to wait for a proper table, I think you could take it to the lobby and outside tables too. Wifi is complimentary throughout the entire hotel and had a decent speed. Certainly enough for web surfing and email. I was able to stream on my phone with no problems. Only two elevators and I agree with other reviewers that it could be slow especially in the morning. Again, we weren't in any rush so we really didn't even care. Overall a great mid-tier grade hotel and would recommend for tourists and business travelers.

The availability was excellent. The reservations were made less than a week prior to the visit, and there was no problem finding a room in the appropriate category which is more than I can say on most NYC hotels. The hotel seems to be a converted apartment building like many other hotels in this range (low-mid range, with free internet and breakfast). As such one can expect to have few elevators, and little space for hotel amenities. As expected the hotels has only 2 elevators, which in the morning time can result in long waiting time (this time it was about 12 minutes). This is to be expected; however the cleaning staff using the same elevator, basically blocking it completely should be avoided during the morning rush hour.Breakfast, as it is, was also a problem. I have come to slightly disappointed with the Hyatt Place breakfasts compared to the competitors. However, the big problem was the limited seating. In order to overcome this problem, there is a sign to wait to be seated. However this does not work very well. I was assigned my seat, and by the time I came back with the food it was already reassigned again (and as there was only one person doing the seating – by the same person). Luckily another seat just become available. “A” for effort, and “F” for execution. The room itself is small, but comfortable relative to NYC standard. For anyone who is used to Hyatt Place standard, it would be about half of the normal size. The bathroom though is well sized and comfortable to use. The designers made every part of the room useable which was nice. Internet was free and fast. As a Diamond I was apparently upgraded to high floor with a view (which was not available for sell); however the Diamond amenity of points is still not posted to my account.We had switched certificate in the middle of the stay, and all what was needed is to re-key the room key. I appreciated the seamless process and the honesty about the need for re-keying (as most place just tell you it is fine, but the key would not work when the certificate change occur).All in all, it would probably not be my first choice in NYC (as location is less than ideal for my need, and the breakfast experience); however using the Hyatt Credit card certificate I will sure be back.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",119,3.0

I'm a frequent traveller to NYC and have always had horrible experiences at expensive business hotels (I have always found the major $400/night midtown hotels to have lousy service and old, dated rooms). I decided to give the Hyatt Place a shot as I was tired of paying up for shoddy treatment. And I'm so glad I did!First off, this is not a luxury hotel. You're not going to get a large lobby with a pianist; there's no bar, no restaurant, and no mini-bar in the room. Reception is relatively tiny and there's no doorman. In the vicinity are a Holiday Inn Express and a Best Western, so you get a sense of what segment this are appeals to. These are not things that bother me though.Check-in was a breeze, the receptionists were efficient and polite and ironically much better than those I'd encountered at the Grand Hyatt. As I was going to be staying there for 2 weeks, I was given a room on a high floor, which I greatly appreciated. The room itself was great. The hotel is only a few months old so everything in the room was new and modern looking. The TV is huge (47"" I believe) and I also had a great view. My room was facing north but I understand the south-facing rooms have a great view of the Empire State Building. The rooms also have individual temperature controls which, for a change, actually work! There is a buffet breakfast every day. It's actually a really good variety, with cereals, fruit, oatmeal, muffins, sausages etc. The only thing is that the spread is the same day-after-day, so you do get sick of the food after awhile. Wifi is free throughout the building and very fast. There is a fitness centre in the basement. It's a bit claustrophobic but it's free, so no complaints. There are computers and printers you can use (for free!) in the lobby.I had a couple of packages sent to the hotel and they were delivered to my room. This is in contrast to more expensive hotels which often ask you to go to the mailroom to collect the packages yourself.Location is great. It's a 3 min walk to the Herald Sq subway stop, which has both the yellow and orange lines. It's 2-3 min walk to Macy's, 5 min from Koreatown, 10 min to Times Square and generally very accessible to all parts of Manhattan.Overall, I had a great experience here. Everyone, from the chambermaids to the bellhop to the receptionists, was polite. The room is large and modern and the free breakfast and wifi are icing on the cake. I will be recommending the Hyatt Place to friends. Why pay 70-80% more for ""luxury"" upscale hotels when you're likely to encounter indifferent staff and old rooms?",Singapore,39,5.0

A little variety in the eggs department would go a long way for people staying more than a night or two. My daughter was also disappointed to find that the oatmeal did not appear to be steel-cut (as promoted).Added bonus: there's a Pure and Fresh restaurant next door that stays open late.

Hence, it took forever for an elevator to arrive and often when it did you had to share your ride with the cleaning crew and chemicals. The situation was even worse at breakfast. As the Hyatt Place has a free breakfast and the size of the room in which the breakfast was served was fairly small (much smaller than one would expect for a hotel with this many rooms), we had to wait in line for the food and then hunt for seats to eat at. After breakfast it was another wait for the elevators. While the room was nice and the price was right ($75 for the Hyatt credit card), unless you do not mind spending part of your vacation waiting around for elevators, my suggestion is to try a different hotel in midtown New York.

We had a car and five people to unload. There is a loading zone for the hotel right out front, and the bell staff did a pretty good job of keeping it clear for hotel patrons.

Unloaded all of our stuff in one room while we waited for the second room (which was done by 5:00).Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable. Views from the 9th floor were unexciting but safe.

Rooms were quiet at night.Breakfast was a typical Hyatt Place AM Skillet--scrambled eggs, link sausage, bagels, pastries, cold and hot cereal, fresh fruit, and coffee for free. Specialty coffee drinks available right there for a fee. There was no line at 7:00 on the first morning. On the second morning, we arrived at 8:00, and found a line of about 20 people that moved pretty quickly (we were serving ourselves in 5 minutes). This Hyatt Place seems to have plenty of bell staff, but housekeeping seems very understaffed. We were on the 9th floor, and the housekeeping staff arrived in our room at nearly 6:00 pm. When we left for dinner at 7:30, they were still cleaning rooms on some of the lower floors. They work very hard, but seem to be a little overworked for the size of the hotel.It's a nice room for a pretty good price (especially if you shop around--we got our rooms for under $200 each) that is in a very convenient location (2 minute walk to Macy's and Herald Sq. metro stop, 5 minute walk to Times Square). Parking is available in a garage half a block away. Would stay here again.","Okemos, Michigan, USA",4,3.0

If traveling with a baby, I would avoid this hotel unless you get an accessible room which has a little more floor space. Second, the travel crib given to us was very dirty...so we ended up buying one of our own. The elevators can get bottle-necked and you end up waiting for a while and packing in with lots of others.

I also have Platinum status with Marriott and Gold with Hilton. I currently do not have ""status"" with Hyatt. However, I've stayed at 10+ Hyatt Places when traveling for business in the past, and since I had the family with me, thought this particular hotel would be a great choice. Given the raving fans, I had high expectations. That was a mistake. Yes, the staff is friendly and responsive but frankly, they didn't really seem to be on top of things. Issue #1: when checking in (after 4PM), room we were assigned was not ready as there was still food in the mini-fridge, personal items left by the previous guest, and linen service was not quite finished. Yes, we were assigned another room, which was great but point is whole situation could have been avoided. Issue #2: I was told parking on the street was OK so long as you read the signs, which I did. What I (and apparantly the staff) didn't know was that due to a parade on the Sunday of my stay, all cars left on the street Sunday morning were towed. The parking authority said signs were posted for days. Problem is I was only in town for the weekend and didn't know or see any signs. Perhaps the staff missed them too. Issue #3: For no apparant reason, we heard dripping (think bad faucet) noises coming from the bathroom starting around 2AM. When we checked, source of the noise was a small but persistent leak coming from the ceiling. Suffice to say by morning, all towels were on the bathroom floor, soaked. We elected to leave first thing in the morning but after waiting for the elevators for 15 minutes, decided to walk down the stairs. Good thing we were not not on a high floor, but 18-20 flights of stairs does take its toll. So in short, my experience can be summed up as not so easy check-in, little to no sleep, no shower in the morning, unanticipated exercise (which I guess can be a positive), and a missing car in the morning. In situations like this, I guess I should ask for a refund, but since I used points, I doubt I'll get any consideration. I am especially disappointed since this is a new facility. I have to believe this is an isolated experience, but for travelers considering this facility, don't believe the hype.",California,6,2.0

We explored NY city on our own. Downloading the subway map onto our smartphone was the best thing we did. Macy's and JC Penney was just round the corner.Room : The room was very clean, the bed was most comfortable, and we had no elevator issues at all. One thing to note was the shower water pressure - there is no control for the water pressure. You can only control the hot/cold temperature but the water pressure is fixed, which we found it to be a tad too low but it wasn't a major issue. There were only 2 of us, so the room size was just right for us. Besides, we only got back after dinner each day just to sleep.Breakfast : The free breakfast was a major plus. We saved heaps by having breakfast in the hotel. And we really enjoyed the NY bagels. We got to the breakfast room early, around 8.30am and always managed to find a seat, but those who came around 9ish had problems finding seats. And no, we didn't get sick of the breakfast eventhough we had it for 9 straight mornings. The hotel lends out adaptors, hair straighteners, curling irons etc for free. We requested for an adapter the first night we arrived, and were told they had loaned them all out. We left our names and checked with front office on 2 other occasions but the answer was always the same : they had loaned them all out. We were hoping to be given priority since we were staying for 9 nights. But even when we checked out, we never got to use the adapters.We would stay here again.","Singapore, Singapore",3,5.0

It’s an easy walk from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, around the corner from Macy’s and other big retailers of Herald Square, near all subways, easy walk to theaters. Our room, #1807 had perfect crisp linens, good bed, a small but well-lit desk with wall outlets for electronics, small refrigerator. A large window gave great light to the room and opened just enough to get fresh air. With the windows open, the street traffic noise came in loud & clear—ok for us former New Yorkers, but almost perfectly blocked just by closing the windows. Air conditioning worked fine when windows were closed. Couch and leather hassock nice for reading, well-lit with wall sconces, same for bed. The small hanging closet had a full-length mirror inside, an ironing board and iron and a safe. Our only issue was maneuvering around each other—the room looks spacious but has some tight corners. Making my way from the side of the bed nearest the wall to the couch area, for instance, I almost always caught my foot in the bedding at the “open” side of the bed. Be careful. Excellent Wi-fi. Shower in our room, no bathtub, super-clean. Free breakfast was the most imaginative encountered—I had a spinach, tomato, egg, ham, cheese open-faced hot sandwich, strong starbucks coffee, fresh OJ . Fruit and pastry (tiny Danish, small donuts, muffins) were available along with usual cereals, etc. A surprisingly large breakfast area—we came down around 8:30 am on Friday morning, joined a short line for the buffet, easily found a table. However at 9:30 am the dining area was completely full. To make room, we took our second cup of coffee and newspaper into the lobby seating area, which was virtually empty. This area was full of hotel chains—next door was a Holiday Express, around the corner a Marriott and a Hilton Garden Inn. The neighborhood is also known for Korean food—we cut through a parking garage to 35th Street in a downpour and had a good meal with cheerful service at Hanbat Restaurant, 53 W. 35th St. Loved the classy wood décor with low moveable partitions for flexible seating. Our Pajun pancake would have served six, the pork in a spicy sauce (don’t recall the name) was delicious. Immediately next door to the Hotel is a very clean & well-stocked kind of fresh-food deli, from which I had a take-out chopped salad the first night. Since our three-day stay was on “points” I can’t speak to price—When I checked the online Hyatt and Priceline list prices, I found a weekend rate of $148—a terrific bargain—but this changed radically for weekday stays. We would definitely stay again if we could--staff was friendly and accommodating, lobby is comfortable with plenty of seating. If you feel like relaxing outside, there are nice metal tables and chairs outside the front door. There are exercise machines on the Lower Level--we didn't try them, but they looked in good shape.

The location was great--an easy walk to shopping, theatres and restaurants. The hotel has been open for a few months now and everything was new. Despite the newness of our room, housekeeping could do a better job focusing on the details in order to ensure that the rooms look good for years to come. Some examples in our room include--vacuuming the baseboards of the bed (there was a press-on fingernail lying here), wiping down the shower drains to remove the long hair, and cleaning or replacing any obviously dirty items (the white pen and stationary were neatly displayed on the desk and it's difficult to see how anyone could have missed the brown sticky soda blotches on the pen when setting up the desk for the next guests).The other complaint we had was that the hotel website uses a lot of standard Hyatt Place pictures, including showing the typical Hyatt Place room that has the large sectional sofa that converts into a bed. The implication being that if you are used to Hyatt Places, you would expect a larger room with a separate sitting area. Therefore, we were surprised to discover that our room was extremely small and cramped for two people. We can understand that space in New York is tight, but management should use accurate pictures of the rooms on the website so as to set proper expectations. Had we known space was going to be an issue, we would have stayed at another Hyatt property since we like to hangout in our rooms during down time.The service was friendly and the staff acknowledged our Diamond status on check-in. The only improvement we can suggest is to add more staff to the front desk--we usually had long wait times whenever we called. The Hyatt Place is not a full service hotel, so we didn't interact with many other staff.We stayed here because we were curious. For the price we paid, we will probably stay at another Hyatt property the next time we visit New York.

What more do you need? We found the breakfast to be plentiful and tasty each day, so nice not to have to go out to eat in the morning.

Unfortunately Hyatt allowed ownership of this property to change the concept to water down almost everything possible that is positive about the Hyatt Place brand. No doubt it will appeal to those who want to put as many guests into a two bedded room as possible at a price point in a very expensive city where poor quality sells for as much as high quality!Its a demand situation which is why hoteliers fight to open properties in New York.If you are a premium 3 star and up traveler you will most likely dislike the outcome of your experience even if you have had positive Hyatt Place experiences previouslyIf you are budget traveler or youth hostel or Holiday Inn fan you may be wowed or simply never stayed at any Hyatt at allPositives• Reasonably friendly hospitable staff trying to overcome the shortcomings of the property • Large flat screen TVs• Excellent location• The property is new• The bathroom is successful as any Hyatt Place property goes minus the counter space• In room small fridge & safeNegatives• Slowwwwwwwwww budget elevators with 25 plus floors and long waits during peak hours that can be cramped• The breakfast hours are unacceptable they close at 9:00 AM with lack luster offerings• It’s inconsiderate for International and domestic travelers on different time zonesThe hotel does not inform guests of the operating hours and leaves it posted on a sign to one side of the elevator if you happen to read it. This is a shorter time frame to dine then what Hyatt Place properties offer their guests across the nation.• Even the best view rooms are not that exceptional in view or design • Rooms are the smallest in the nation of any Hyatt Place property • Hyatt Place is meant to be in concept an all suite property yet these are standard small NYC guest rooms which is misleading when the brand features a suites concept like Embassy Suites nationwide• The beds are hard as a rock with no box springs for comfort • Box springs are typically a standard at every Hyatt Place nationwide. • These are uncomfortable. Cost cutting?• Almost no room for a luggage rack for one person one must get mighty creative• The closets are the width of the in room safe • They shoved to much furniture into a very small space/room• The lighting is poor,cheap and glary• Numerous rings and your lucky if anyone picks the phone up at the front desk at peak times. Final assessment I have seen nothing but crazy high prices on their website from 250 to 600 a night something I would never consider for the quality/size of rooms offered. However at the rates others have mentioned at 150 or below then the defects and disappointments make this property a steal.Good luck at finding those rates.I highly recommend Hyatt 48 Lex and Andaz Wall Street when in New York and choosing to stay Hyatt which are outstanding and offer exceptional value especially to Hyatt’s most frequent guests of their Gold Passport program.There are certainly much better choices all over New York with better design elements and more amenities to make for a more pleasant and enjoyable and comfortable spacious experience No doubt there will be some happy with Hyatt Place just as it is today in a city where anything will sell with the highest demand in the country for hotel roomsHeres hoping if Hyatt does open more Hyatt Place properties they build them similar to all things great about the Hyatt Place brand just as they should of this time around.The hotel and the website should be more transparent, honest and clear that this is a radical departure from what guests come to expect from a Hyatt Place property. There will certainly be an audience happy to get a clean new room none the lessCalling this property amazing in any capacity is a big stretch and misleading for others It certainly will be adequate for some and could be considered a tad better than average if one is being generously nice.Cheers","San Diego, California",153,2.0

Thankfully, there was nothing to worry about. While there's no grand marble entrance and glistening chandeliers (which, for an extra $250 per night your could easily have) reception is clean, efficient and staffed by some very enthusiastic Hyatt employees. We had an issue straight away as our first room would only sleep two, but the staff were quick to react and resolve the issue. The hotel location was perfect for our trip. Within 5-10 minute walks we could be at Macy's, Times Square, Penn Station, 5th Avenue, etc. We ended up in the double queen room. The room was very clean and presented extremely well, the TV was great and had the option for us to hook in our iPad to watch some of the content we brought with us. Bathroom was a good size, nice shower but no bath. I would request a room with a bath next time rund after all the walking we were doing!We took advantage of the a.m. Skillet each morning which provided a great range of food, something for all the family from fruit/cereal to hot sandwiches from the hot plate. This being free would save a family like ours about $30-$40 a day on having to eat out for breakfast. Staff were constantly ensuring that nothing ran out, even though it was a pretty busy place around 9am each morning. The potential drawback is how busy it can get in the morning. We were lucky in that we always found a table, but I did notice times when people were having to hang around for a table to clear. It's not the biggest eating area in the world so I'd definitely be tempted to beat the rush each morning and get downstairs for 8:30 at the latest. Means you'll have more of the day to enjoy in the city.Overall, I would not hesitate to use the hotel again, either for business or pleasure. The combination of location, price, cleanliness, facilities and staff make this a hard place to beat. As for the elevators, we didn't have any issue with them at all, and we were on the 23rd floor. I think the problems have to be down to snagging given that the hotel is so new.","Newton Mearns, United Kingdom",10,5.0

As almost everyone else has noted, there is a real problem with the elevators, even when they were both working. I built in an extra 30 minutes to our departure time each day because we were touring colleges and could not be late for appointments. We were on the top floor so once the elevator arrived, it was empty and we could get on, but people on lower floors did not fare as well since it would fill up after 3 or so stops. We would then have to stop at almost every floor since people were waiting so long and no one could get on--I felt bad one family missed their train. There were definitely a lot of upset travelers. The breakfast is mediocre. if you get down there before 8:00 there is usually no problem and a couple of days we went down at 7:30 got our food and brought it up to the room. I booked a double queen with a sleeper sofa for me and my teenage daughter. We had a view of the Empire State Bldg., which was great, but the rooms are very small and you can really hear the street noise. We usually stay at the Doubletree Suites on Times Square which is a much noisier location and i never notice the street noise. Also beds are very hard, there are not enough plugs for charging electronic and there is no counter space in the bathrooms. They could have easily put a shelf under the sink so you could store your toiletries but didn't and there are no towel bars, even though there is plenty of room on the wall for two bars. Note to any hotel interior designers, if you're going to leave guests a card asking them to re-use their towels to help save our planet, you should probably install a towel bar for them to put them on so they can dry. Finally, there is virtually no service at this hotel. Front desk staff is friendly, but very weak. While I was checking in, the desk clerk answered a call for a food request and had no paper available to write it on. She forgot the room number but had said it out loud so i was able to repeat it to her. Also, My husband was joining us mid-stay so we left a key for him at the front desk in an envelope with his name. when he got there no one could find it so they gave a new key, but rekeyed the room so i was locked out. no big deal but going back down on the elevator to get a new key was a half hour outing. This hotel is way overpriced for what you get.","Marin County, California",22,2.0

On the plus side, furnishings in the room are very good, the bed is very comfortable and the bathroom fittings are modern and stylish. I did in fact have a good nights sleep, which is not easy in NYC for under $300 a night all inclusive.On the minus side, breakfast is not up to standard -a very small area with simply too many customers, too few people serving and not a very wide selection of options (see NH hotels breakfast range if you want a reference in the 3* hotel segment). The elevators are inadequate -queues are just offputting. I was on the 5th floor so even though I had no view, I could walk down the stairs if need be (almost always). Finally, customer service was a little hit and miss -sometimes good sometimes frustrating (how difficult can it be to print me a hotel invoice with my company name on it?) and the hotel just lacked the little touches that make it special, such as a complementary bottle of drinking water in each room (I had to fork out $3.50 for one). As this hotel is not cheap, these little touches should be in the package.","Barcelona, Spain",41,3.0

We were originally going to stay at the Marriott New York Downtown, however the restaurant and a lot of amenities were rendered inactive by Hurricane Sandy. We decided to look at other options and found the Hyatt for the same price. Before booking the room, we looked up some reviews on TripAdvisor and other sites to determine if it was a good choice. We saw nothing but bad reviews, but we found out that the hotel just opened two weeks prior and a lot of the reviews were written a day or two after opening. The reviews mentioned rude staff, long 10-15 minute waits for the elevator, and long lines for free breakfast. We didn't experience any of this. The staff was amazing! We were able to check-in 3 hours early. I specifically want to thank Matthew, who saved our butts! I was using a pre-paid MasterCard to cover the room. I called ahead to ensure I put enough on the card to cover authorizations and a little extra incase of emergency. What I didn't know, is that my card company adds a 15% authorization of their own for hotel stays. My card was declined and we came in from Canada. I called the card company and they would not relent. Matthew, who checked us in, did everything possible to help us correct the problem. In the end, they made an exception for us and they allowed us to put down the incidental authorization in cash, which would be transferred to the room account. The difference would be applied to my card, which worked! I thought we'd be SOL! He earned his tip, though I felt that we should have given more (if I was able to afford it). Our interactions with the rest of the staff was equally pleasant. We never had to wait more than 3 minutes for an elevator, even though the hotel only has two, and we went up/down several times throughout the day. Even during the breakfast hours, the elevator was fairly quick. It may be slower during the final hour of breakfast, but we never had an issue. Breakfast was not very busy in our experience, but we got there very early. Breakfast was great. A staff member greeted us when we went down and dire ted us to the breakfast area. My only issue was that the pancakes were cold, but I can't complain. My girlfriend noted a lack of sandwiches but that wasn't an issue either. The sausage was hot and fresh. The greeter also greeted us on the way back out and asked how our breakfast was before getting the elevator for us. If you want something different, there is several McDonalds, Starbucks, and stores near by, that carry sandwiches and fresh fruit. Try Herald Square Market for a buffet style lunch (charged by weight) or order from the gallery downstairs. Finally, the location was amazing, but has a caveat. The hotel is less than 5 blocks from New York Penn Station, Times Square, Madison Square Garden, and Macy's. The only issue, which isn't something that the hotel has control over, is that taxi's rarely come down the street in front of the hotel. You can ask the gallery host to call a car for you though, which is operated by a private company. Upon leaving our room to check-out, a woman from housekeeping greeted us and we've never experienced that at a Marriott or Sheraton. A nice touch! We were taking the bus at 7:30pm on the day of check-out and we needed a place to store our bags because the Port Authority Bus Terminal didn't provide lockers. The hotel stored our bags for us, during the afternoon. Over all, the hotel provided us with 5-star service from check-in to check-out. Better than any 4-star hotel we've stayed at, and it's only 3.5 stars! Matthew, the guy that checked us in, asked us if we sorted out our card issues when we checked out and we had a brief conversation with him before leaving. My girlfriend and I agreed that if we end up in New York City again, we will be staying at the Hyatt Place Mid-Town South.","St. Catharines, Canada",18,5.0

I reserved online and booked a suite. We were 5 people. The info on the web site said 2 queen and a sofa bed. The picture showed a nice sized room the 2 queens together then a little partition and the sofa on the other side. Perfect we thought. Instead when we got there, we got a tiny room 2 queens and the sofa bed crammed in there that when it was opened we had absolutely no room left to move around . We called the front desk to see if we can get a bigger room like what we saw on the internet. They said all the rooms are the same size. We dont know why it showed a bigger room. False advertisement if u ask me!!!! Then to wait for an elevator took about 10 minutes and more because there are only 2 and one was always stopped. So if you are above the 10th floor be careful you'll be using the stairs a lot. We had dirty dishes in front of our room all day every day. The staff working the front desk were not helpful. They are still in training from what it looked like. I understand the hotel has just opened but train your staff a little more. The only good thing was the breakfast.

On the website it stated it was a new hotel and was opening the end of March. Approximately 2 weeks after I made online reservations someone from the Hyatt Consumer Affairs office called me. She told me the rate I had booked at was a mistake and that our rate would actually be $47 per night per room more. After I threatened to contact the BBB and Chamber of Commerence I was told they would issue me a refund after my trip was completed if I would email the bill to them. I thought that was weird because they should have access to the bill since they were in the corporate office. I just returned from our stay and have sent the bill to them. So we sill have not resolved that part yet. When we made the reservations online we called the hotel directly and told them we would be traveling with 3 small children and we needed our rooms either across or next to each other. One we got to the hotel we found out we were on different floors. Again, after much arguing with them they moved us to another floor and we were told we were next door to each other. Once we got to the rooms we found they were at opposite ends of the hall. Again, not beside or across from each other. The desk clerk said that was the best they could do. Because of the time of day it was we just took the rooms. The next morning when we went downstairs to breakfast ( it was included with the room) we could not find a place to sit anywhere in the dining room, lobby, etc. We finally had to sit on the floor and the children put their food on a stool to eat. What a mess !!! The next day we went downstairs and ask the front desk clerk ( we tried to reach them on the room phone but they never answered) where the pool was. We were told ""there is no pool"". I said on your website (not the Hyatt's website) but this specific hotels website it shows a pool. He said sorry we do not have a pool. The same night we were leaving to go our for dinner ( we were on the 20th floor) and could not get the elevator to go down. The elevator kept opeining and closing but would not move. So we walked 20 flights with 3 children down the stairs. I wish I could say we only did this once but we wound up having to do it 3 times during a 4 day stay. There were 2 elevators in the entire hotel but only one worked. Remember this is a NEW hotel !!! The only positive thing I can say about this hotel was that the Empire State Building was right outside of our window. We had a beautiful view at night when it was lite up and during the day when it was not lite. This was my first stay at a Hyatt ( I always stay at Hilton's) and it will be my last. I can only hope they get some of these items worked out. The rate was ok but not terrific so I am not sure why they felt like they needed to increase it.

Being a brand new hotel, everything was clean and fresh. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and had a lot of variety. Hotel staff was also very friendly. The location for us was great. You are just around the corner from Macy's, the subway and not too far from Times Square. The worse thing about the hotel were the elevators (there are only two for 26 floors). They took forever. Plus - one broke down so it was out of commission for Sunday and most of Monday. Luckily we were on the 4th floor and ended up using the steps a lot. Knowing the wait would be so long on Monday - we allowed ourselves extra time to wait for the elevator - and when it did come - it was full. We put our luggage on the elevator with strangers and ran down to meet it in the lobby to retrieve it. We beat the elevator from the 4th floor to the lobby. Also, if you go during the peak breakfast hours, be prepared to either wait in line or wait for a table to open up.

I am coming to NYC with a small group of friends in a few months so I stayed at the new Hyatt Place this week to check it out. I had a reservation for five nights, but just couldn't stay more than three.For starters, Hyatt should not have posted the pictures of another Hyatt Place on the web-site, because the building and its interior is not at all like some of the photos. They do have some good basics: reasonable price (for NYC), good location near midtown, comfortable bed, good lighting, free wifi, a nice TV, a safe and a fridge. However there were just too many other issues I had problems with.During the time I was there, there were huge lines for both the (admittedly free) breakfast and the 2 tiny elevators. I ended up going to Starbucks for breakfast instead, and a few times I walked up to my 14th floor room, or walked up to the 3rd floor and took the elevator down then up again instead of waiting. In my room, the thermostat was permanently stuck at 74 degrees, and the stopper in the bathroom sink was not working properly. I could not get the shades to work at all, so never saw daylight. There were always things left behind in the halls by the housekeepers.Every morning I also found takeout restaurant menus pushed under the room door; when I mentioned this to the front desk staff they said that people were sneaking into the hotel to distribute the menus to every rooms. This place has 24 floors, and I would have thought security people should have spotted and questioned someone going from room to room wandering around the hallways.This is a brand new place but its already showing little signs of wear and tear, and although some staff are quite nice, others need to be educated in the basic courtesy that loyal customers expect from Hyatt brand hotels. To be fair, many of the employees seemed overworked and overwhelmed by the crowds of guests, mostly noisy groups of tourists. When I asked for help with issues in my room, staff were typically too busy to assist.In June my group will not be staying here, but will go to the Hyatt 48 Lex instead.","Belmont, California",9,2.0

We are frequent guests of Hyatt Hotels, so we were excited to hear that this one had just opened, and we were going to have chance for a quick trip. After arriving at the hotel on our first night, we were asked to come back later as check in wasn't until after 3pm. The staff quickly secured our luggage, and we went to explore the city. We returned at 5pm tired and ready to check in. Our room's view wasn't that great as we were on a lower floor, but the room was clean and spacious. We had two double beds and a pull out sofa. I have stayed in many hotel rooms in NY, and was surprised at the size of the room, we also had nice size fridge. Our first night was disturbed by fire alarms going off at 1am, due to a boiler issue. This resulted in no hot water the next morning, which was quickly resolved by 11. Not a big problem, as this gave us chance to run down to the restaurant and pick up a yummy breakfast. Open faced egg, cheese and avocado skillet sammies, pancakes, fresh fruit, etc. - my hubby is on a low carb diet, and was able to eat something. The coffee was hot, and delicous (starbucks) - I worked for Marriott hotels for many years, therefore had the luxury of staying in some of the best hotels in NY. I would have to say - if I was to visit again, I would probably choose this hotel over the big ones in Times Square. The location is fantastic - Empire State, Broadway, Macy;s Times Square all within a couple of mins away. Again, this is not one of the big fancy hotels, but more of an intimate boutique hotel, but well worth checking out. Big fancy foyers and doormen dressed to the nines is very impressive, but let's be honest, what is the most important part of staying in a hotel - COMFORT - and this place has it..... Before I forget, the staff are #1. Sorry, I should have mentioned them first - from the second we checked in to the time we left we were well taken care of and always met with a big NY smile.... This is now my official #1 hotel in NY - Thank You","Richmond, Virginia",1,5.0

(Hyatt there is room to move this!) Staff a little disorganised (benefit of doubt as just opened)Summary - Probably worth a go if you get at the right price otherwise look at Hiton Garden Inn just behind on 35th.",Sydney,10,3.0

The room was small but nicely appointed. We had a view of the Empire State Building from our window. The lobby/business area is small, but as expected, for the price.There is a bar area, and a free breakfast with a comfortable dining area. In general the hotel is obviously understaffed and not well trained. That is Hyatt's responsibility. The desk personnel didn't know much about the area, and what was available as far as restaurants etc. They didn't even have a printed hand out. We are Platinum so when I asked about late check-out, the desk clerk said, ""Oh I don't think that is possible. We are overbooked, and understaffed."" I said, ""Do you know that for certain?"" since no effort was made to check. He repeated that he was ""overbooked and understaffed."" Poor service. We also got on an elevator in the morning and started are descent with a lone bag of garbage that was inadvertently left on the elevator. It was grabbed by a maid in mid descent from another floor, with an apology. The breakfast was good, but really understaffed. Beverages were not being replenished. The room was clean and nice, but it was only a few days old. There was a mini-fridge in the room which was not a pay bar, but an empty useable fridge. I would give this hotel another shot for a good price. They really need to train their people.","Saratoga Springs, New York",71,3.0

Very similar to Holiday Inn Express model.On the positive side: The room was modern, reasonable size and equipped with all the essentials: comfortable bed, effective shower, large HD tv, fridge, in-room safe. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location was good (midtown is just right place to be located if you want to do the traditional stuff)On the negative side:The elevators (lifts to us Brits)!!!! There were only two for the whole hotel and it has about 26 floors so during busy period you have to wait a very long time. We chose to walk down the emergency exit stairs most times but if you have a room anywhere above the 12th floor that becomes a bit impratical.The breakfast was okay except for the scrambled eggs which were terrible (prepared from packs of liquid eggs) but the eating area is too small for the number of guests so it was always very crowded",LON,0,3.0

However, if you have a car, beware. They have an agreement with a local garage, but they refuse to provide a curbside loading area so you are at a high risk of a $115 parking ticket. Do not trust them to advise you of anything. The valet brought the car, packed at the front door along the curb & delivered keys to the front desk. I was standing in the lobby but waiting for an associate to come down, as the car arrived in less than 10 minutes, not the predicted 30 as advised by the front desk. I less than 3 minutes a ticket was issued on the car within the view of desk personnel. They did nothing to stop it or even point it out. Had I not been on the lobby the car would haw been towed immediately. Instead, the $115 parking citation was in my hand and the GM simply said "" it's not our responsibility after the valet delivers.

This hotel just opened a few days before my March 18 arrival. The place was ready for guests! The rooms were spacious and tastefully done (we had a double double view) with wonderful beds and a great view. We slept well!The check in was seamless and everyone was pleasant and professional. The next morning we woke up at 8:30 and went downstairs for breakfast at 9:35. Oops, breakfast ends at 9:00. No problem, really. I should have checked (or maybe I was told and forgot).The off putting incident came when I helped myself to a cup of coffee (the dispensers had not been removed) and a scowling odd little man in a suit came over and said ""you must pay..no more free coffee."" Er, ok. I asked what time the free coffee ended. He said 9:30. I shook my head and said ""really""? He glared at me for a second then waved his hands and said, ""ok, ok, just one cup."" There was another guest that heard the whole exchange and he shook his head and said to me, ""whoa, that was not pleasant."" Yeah.So, I'll be back for sure but they really should consider breakfast till 10 (it is NYC after all) but even if they don't, at least tell the little guy in the suit to smile and be a bit more hospitable.","Northampton, Massachusetts",12,4.0

Always smiling & happy to help, NOTHING is too much for the staff here. The hotel is perfectly located to start sightseeing almost as soon as you leave the hotel doors. Which one can only do after filling up on the hearty hot & cold buffet breakfast - you really are set up for the day after this! Being brand new, having opened its doors a few days ago, the whole place is spotless. Contemporary, chic rooms are spacious with a luxurious feel (huge bed & incredibly comfortable; 42 inch LCD tv, tea & coffee in room & a fridge - rather unusual for NYC). Free wifi throughout & computers in the foyer for all to use. And then there's the view. Our room was on the 25th floor, at the back of the hotel - so we woke up to The Empire State Building right in front of us! At night, the whole City twinkles & you can see all the way down to Wall St. Having visited NYC a few times before & stayed at the Waldorf Astoria & Marriott hotels, I would always come back here in the future. It may not have the grand foyer, but the rooms are beautiful & the staff really do go that extra mile to make your stay perfect. Being from London & having travelled around the world, I expect a first class service. That is certainly what you can expect here. In fact, during our stay we decided that Devon Alexander never sleeps! She is ever present, leading her team by example. This whole review may sound too good to be true, but this hotel really did make our stay. When you've found a little gem in the heart of New York, its only fair to share the details so that others may also have the happiest stay. We're both seasoned travellers, but the team here have seriously impressed us. Why go anywhere else? We will certainly be back!",,2,5.0
