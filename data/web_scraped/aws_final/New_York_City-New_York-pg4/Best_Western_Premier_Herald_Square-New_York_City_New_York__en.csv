We couldn't have asked for a better stay. I did so much research before choosing this location and was very happy with my choice. The staff was excellent. So kind, introduced themselves and gave great dinner recommendations. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated. They are normal size for New York. Our room was on the back side of the hotel, so there was not a view. But what we did have was the ability to open the window and get some fresh air. It was also surprisingly quiet when we did open the window. We only utilized the breakfast area once. It was a typical spread, but the bagels seemed to be fresh from the area. The location couldn't have been better. It was great to be around the corner from the Empire State Building, shopping, great restaurants and so much more. Times Square was easily within walking distance.","Olympia, Washington",16,5.0

My friend and I had come for a theatre trip and we flew in on the red eye. We got in about 8am and Alam and his team got us an early check in, which was so fantastic! Yes, the rooms are small, but if you are expecting a large room you better be ready to pay a large price! For the cost, these rooms are fantastic. We were on the second floor, but you couldn't really hear the street. My friend and I travel together often and she struggles to sleep in hotels, but not here! We slept well every night. Our needs were met. I only went down to breakfast once, but it was lovely. The rooms were cleaned well, and the location was in perfect walking distance of the theatre district, Morgan Library, Bryant Park, and Herald Square. Subway around the corner.

Second it’s location is smack dab in the middle of everything. Look if you want a view go book at a hotel double in price. I used to do that, then I realized I spend 90% of my time outside of the room. So I really look for location, amenities, price, and most of cleanliness. This place had all of it. On top of it being a clean room top to bottom, they checked me in at 12:30pm. I’ve stayed at a ton of hotels in my life, I’ve never been able to check in that early. The staff was completely gracious and amazing, and even printed my concert ticket for me too. All I can say is I had three rooms I booked and cancelled up until I chose this place and I’m extremely glad I did. I saved money and stayed in a clean hotel in one of the best locations in nyc.

The following day I was told my cash was in the bank already and could not do anything. They were able to charge me a night, and I explicitly asked to be fully charged before arriving, so I think they only wanted the cash. I was given no receipt, so I asked about it in order to get back my 200usd deposit before leaving... I must say all staff was very inexperienced, I have never had such a bad experience in the world, not even when no one spoke English.The room was large, comfortable enough, TV kept buffering though and it was very cold at night because of the poorly insulated windows.Location is good, price was 1150 usd for 9 nights which is kind of a good deal for NY, but if I knew I would have encountered these issues I would have booked at a fancier hotel.Overall this is an option if you cannot afford more (especially for being on 36th street) , but don't expect luxury of any kind.

We spent so long looking at where to stay for our trip to NYC having never visited before, so pleased that we decided to book here. The best feature of this place is its location, its in walking distance to Times Square, Top of The Rock and The Empire State building. We also walked to central park one day this took about half hour. FYI Bryant Park is very close and worth a visit. Food wise we ate out as this is NYC and you have so much choice from dollar pizzas to high end fine dining. The hotel does a happy hour for drinks early evening and this was worth it before going out. Breakfast at the hotel is delicious and the pancakes and maple syrup are insane. There is a little Irish Bar / Restaurant 'The Keg Room' opposite the hotel and they have basketball games and sports playing at the bar, we loved this place. Our room was a standard room and I can honestly say its the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in, although I understand this is a standard thing for NYC.

Our most pleasant experiences involved the staff: housekeeping supplied us with items we forgot or needed more of; the breakfast crew served up a pleasant good morning, and the front desk accomodated us when we forgot to check-out (because you Will sleep well) and arranged for another room at reasonable rates when we extended our stay.

Lots of choices to choose from such as eggs, bacon, pancakes, and waffles. You can also have hot coffee and tea. By the way, do visit the hotel bar for its very excellent priced drinks during happy hour and do remember the hotel is located in mid-town Manhattan. Say hi to Farrah, the bartender for she is so nice, helpful, and friendly. Do remember to bring your BOGO voucher for the drinks. Lastly, if you are a Best Western member, you can also get an additional 250 points if you spend at least $20 at the bar. Do tip Farrah nicely for she deserves it. As a Best Western diamond member, I was recognized by the front desk and I did get a bag of goodies. They also had a function to request for amenities and it was sent up to your room within 30 minutes without charge. This is something I expected from five star hotels such as Hyatt and Hilton. So, for Best Western to do that is something I appreciated. On a side note, they also gave you extra requested amenities, so that was nice and generous.Yet, one let down amongst everything else being so good was the $25 gift card voucher. I did submit the gift card printout to the front desk prior to check in and it has been almost two weeks already, but it was not deducted from my total charges. I hope Best Western customer service will reply soon to my email in regards to that issue.

For us there was more than enough choice. The dining room has limited capacity, but even at its busiest we didn’t have to wait for long for a table. We used the hotel bar, lovely staff in there, and the happy hour is very good value with good quality drinks. The biggest thing I want to acknowledge and thank the reception staff and house keeping staff for, involves my husband and my reusable Starbucks cups. We brought our inexpensive reusable Starbucks travel cups along to use to purchase coffees, and also use instead of disposable cups for the complementary (good quality) drinks in reception. On our last day, I realised the cups were missing, we had used them each day up until then. I reported this to reception who not only investigated as promised, but initiated the lady in charge of housekeeping to actually go out and purchase us lovely Starbucks travel cups as a replacement. She acknowledged she had spoken to the lady who had done our housekeeping, who had mistakenly thrown them out, believing we didn’t want them anymore.

One of the bartenders has tricks he uses to cheat customers.I was an easy target for the bartender to rip me off. My husband ordered a beer, approximately 4.50 dollars, and I paid with my credit card. On the receipt I got to sign, it did say 20 dollars and I didn’t understand why. Instead of asking, I thought it was some kind of suggested tip, and that I was supposed to write the amount I wanted to pay. There were line for tip and a line for total. So on the line for total I wrote the amount I wanted to pay. I wanted to make sure I did right and asked the bartender but he just dismissed me. The whole thing ended up with me paying the beer over 25 dollars. When I later that night went back to ask the bartender why he charged me so much for the drink, he was very rude, asking me why I would sign a 20 dollar receipt for a beer, he had ‘all’ the receipts except for mine etc. Of course I made the mistake of not questioning why he charged me 20$, trusting the hotel’s bartender, also not asking for my own copy of the receipt. However the main issue here is that the bartender had the intention to rip me off which I think is so sad. I hope he had a good time with that extra tip. As far as I am concerned, I learned a lesson. And in my opinion, he ripped me off.Furthermore I informed the staff at the reception who promised to look this up, but no body from the hotel cared to get back to me.","Malmo, Sweden",2,3.0

A great location to get around to see the sites; either walking or take the subway. We arrived way early to check in time. They had our room ready within an hour. There is a luggage room to store your bags in the meantime. The fellow that took care of the bags & brought them to our room was also very polite smiley & willing to do whatever it takes to keep guests happy. The reviews I read said the rooms were small. There is plenty of room to get around one another; this is not an issue. There are small details within the hotel & amenities to appreciate (too many to name). The beds are decent & the rooms are very clean & modern. Other than a few doors opening & closing around around bedtime, noise was not an issue. BREAKFAST was delicious & not your typical continental. We arrived prior to the “6:30am” open time however Aymun was cordial & permitted us to go in & eat. Debbie arrives at 430am to make the REAL scrambled eggs & quiche. There is another young fellow working down there. We met him the day before; he said come early because the line will go out into the hallway. There is a fair amount of seating; you can bring your food up to your room. Beside toasting up your bread or bagel everything else is hot & ready to eat. Great price, clean hotel, very friendly & accommodating staff. We would definitely stay here again & recommend for your stay. We were pleased with everything!",,2,5.0

My criteria is reasonably priced, good location, clean, good service, complimentary breakfast, fitness center.Pros:Convenient location in Manhattan CleanFriendly and efficient serviceComplimentary breakfast with hot and cold foodsFree newspaper in the lobbyFree Wi-FiComplimentary coffee, tea and infused water in the lobbyCozy bar in the back Hot shower which feels good after a long dayCons:Small rooms - tight quarters just for sleepingBasic fitness roomWalls are thinI shopped around for a hotel that was clean, had a good location, reasonably priced and if possible, have complimentary breakfast and Best Western Premier Herald Square fit the bill. I know in New York, especially in Manhattan it is difficult to find a reasonable price for a stay and usually the best deals are directly on the hotel websites. I am a gym rat and I knew there was a fitness room and hoped that I could get a good work-out there.When my friends and I arrived, we were met with friendly front desk and they put us in rooms right next to each other which is great! I loved most of the amenities: free wi-fi, complimentary coffee, tea and infused water all day in the lobby, coupon for buy one drink, get one free in the bar. The rooms were small but clean.I noticed on the first day that the light in the doorway flickered out and left a note for housekeeping and when we returned that same day, the light was fixed! The second day, we were tired from walking and sightseeing and came back to the room to rest but after about 20 minutes, we heard a loud noise and it was apparent that a maintenance crew was doing some repairs in the room two doors from us and it sounded like they were in our room as they were shouting and talking loudly. So much for our naps but they did not realize anyone was in the rooms on our floor. The second day we came home around 5 from a long day out and wanted to rest and we found that housekeeping was just finishing up cleaning our room so we had to wait in our friends' room next door until she finished cleaning up our room. We thought it was a bit late but I guess it was a busy day for housekeeping.In trying out the fitness room, it is located on the lower level near the dining room and it has the basic equipment along with wet wipes, towels and water. There are no mats for stretching or extra props like stability or bosu balls. Of course the room only fits 3 machines: cycling, treadmill and elliptical and free weights. So you can get a basic workout there. We also checked out the cozy bar in the back and it has two big screens to watch sports which we did one night and we used our buy one get one free drink coupon. It was inviting and the bartender didn't rush us out at closing as the basketball playoffs had gone overtime for 5 minutes, and she let us watch until the end.As far as the complimentary buffet breakfast goes, it is well worth the stay but a heads up is get there before 8 am as it gets crowded between 8 and 9 am (hours are 6:30 to 9:30 am). Service is quick, friendly and efficient and the staff are attentive, and welcome you and point you to an available table and clean up tables quickly so turnover is fast. There is a variety of food available, fresh fruit, juices, hot and cold cereal, hot foods like bacon or sausages, scrambled eggs, omelettes, waffles, a toaster to heat up your bagels or toast, pastries, yogurt, coffee and tea so you have much to choose from. The location is good and easy to walk to Times Square, catch a subway or catch a tour on Big Bus or any of the other tour buses. We found that Times Square and Broadway can be very congested with people and cars and we ended up walking to and from the theatre district due to the congestion of cars. We did take Uber and Lyft during our stay and it wasn't a problem getting to our hotel. I got alot of walking during this trip and that is part of my exercise routine. We stayed here for 5 nights and I would return as it is a solid 4 star.","Oakland, California",127,4.0

We had to turn it off due to blowing on our heads ... then the room got a little cold as it was extremely cold in NYC while we were there. For some reason the shower water sputtered and we never did get a good flow. The breakfast room is on the lower level, was a good size and had a lovely variety of breakfast foods. Hotel staff was very professional and accommodating.The hotel also had a quaint little back patio bar where we enjoyed a cold beverage after a long day of sightseeing.

We choose it because we were able to get two double beds in a single room and for its proximity to the theaters. It definitely delivered on these! The location was super convenient; not only to theater, but for traveling (we took the train to/from Penn Station which was a short 10 minute walk from the hotel). We stayed in room 604 which was facing an alley making it very quiet. There were fresh ear plugs on the night stand when we arrived, but we did not even need them- I never heard much street noise.The room was tight for 3 adults, but we expected this knowing hotels in Manhattan tend to be quite small. Had we been staying more than the weekend, it wouldn't gotten annoying, but for the 2 night stay it was perfectly fine for us.The room was clean. The linens left something to be desired (clearly clean, just not high quality - one of our towels had a hole in it), but again, for the price point, we weren't upset. The shower, however, was great! Fantastic water pressure and hot! This was so nice since we visited during a cold weekend in January (temps in the 20s F) and needed to warm up after spending all day walking around in the cold.Another reason we chose the hotel was for the convenience of having breakfast included. Breakfast was fine - bagels, pastries, eggs, sausage, waffles/pancakes, yogurt, coffee, etc. We opted to skip breakfast the second morning to find something a bit nicer. In retrospect, given all the grab-and-go options in NYC, I probably wouldn't bother with breakfast at the hotel. The lobby had ice water, hot tea, and hot coffee 24/7 - nice bonus.The staff was great - very pleasant and helpful. Ryan stored our bags for us upon arrival (before our room was ready) and after checkout (so we could come back for them before catching our train). I kept forgetting things in my bags and needed to get back to them and Ryan was so nice and patient each time!Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, especially given the low price point compared to other hotels around the city.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",7,4.0

The room was quite small but the staff were very efficient at clearing tables and keeping things moving.The location of this hotel is excellent and there are so many things to see within walking distance. The subway is also just round the corner and Penn Station is about ten minutes walk away. We ate in Trademark restaurant which is right beside the hotel a couple of times and it was very good and had a nice atmosphere.This was our first time in New York and this hotel added to the overall enjoyment of our holiday.

We were 704 which had no view but 2 very comfortable beds a small hanging robe, tv and a very nice modern walk in shower . We also had coffee tea etc .The lobby had coffee going all day and a very welcome ice cold water fountain .The hotel offered breakfast which is something I’d not experienced in NYC before and I had no expectations other than I thought it would be very basic . Again I was wrong it was excellent and Axman who was on duty was great !!!!Hot and cold choices and it was fresh and plentiful .. set us up for the day .I would definately reccomend this hotel and I will return one day .

When we contacted the hotel we were initially told they had no details of my booking and was placed on hold long enough for me to learn the words to their terrible music! Subsequently I rang back to be told that I did have a booking and that my card was declined therefore it had been cancelled. When I attempted to rebook directly I was informed that they had no availability... strange that as I had thought I had a room a few moments earlier. Booking.com could not help as the payment is handled by the hotel. When I checked my credit card not only had they taken the payment for the room they cancelled, my partner received a notification from his bank that they had attempted to take a payment from his card without any authorisation.

As a group of three friends celebrating my birthday, we were disappointed when we arrived and found that we had not been given the room we requested. They rooms were very small for three of us and we did considering moving hotels. Well that would have been a huge mistake let me tell you we are so glad we didn’t do it. The staff at the hotel are amazing the lady on reception is so friendly and helpful (I think her name is B.B.) she met almost every request we gave her with professionalism and a smile this included facilitating a room change the following day that afforded us a most spectacular view of the Empire State Building, absolutely mind blowing. She also sent a bottle of bubbly to our room. We requested fridge and this was in the room in less that ten minutes. Very efficient staff. One thing that let them down and I did mention this time and time again was that only towels for two people were left in the room by house keeping and drinks for two also, not a major issue but like I said it’s an honest warts and all review. The breakfast staff were fantastic always saving us our same table daily and the food was way above the standard we had expected, it was delicious and plentiful. We had an amazing time here and were very sad to leave. I have booked to return to New York in December with my family this time however I was so disappointed not to be able to book this hotel this time but it was way out on my price range so I settled for the one next door as the area is close to everything yet far enough away from the madness of it all. There was a lovely Market there on Sunday and Macey’s and other shops are just a few minutes stroll away. The area felt very safe and we walked around at all hours without any problems. One thing that I will have to complain about is the hotel booked a car for us recommending a firm that charge a flat rate. We were quoted $70 and despite feeling that we would not make it to the airport in one piece because of his dangerous driving we still gave the driver $75 he chased us down into the airport terminal and was very rude and intimidating. He demanded more money and as three woman travelling together we felt he was very threatening and aggressive towards us and we felt we had no choice but to hand over the cash and that really soured the trip for us. We would all return here no problem at all (except price) but we would certainly not use the car service again. Thank you so much for making my birthday a very memorable one.

Robert took my request and, despite the hotel being sold out, would see if he could hold 2 of the rooms as soon as they were available.We arrived early at Penn Station via Amtrak and quickly got a cab at the taxi stand in front of Madison Square Garden which sits atop the station. Total fare was $11 with generous tip. When we arrived at the hotel, Robert was indeed able to save us rooms so we were able to freshen up before heading to graduation.The rooms, both with 2 double beds, were small but comparable to other hotels in the area. Grandpa was able to navigate with his cane and walker even though it was a little tight. Everything was in good repair, the rooms were clean along with the public areas. Everyone said they were able to get a good night's sleep and I didn't hear any street noise at night (we were on the 9th floor).The first floor includes the front desk and sitting area, a 24 hour coffee/tea area and a rest room. In the back there is a small bar with stools and a couple tables and padded bench seating. Enough room for about 10-15 people. Behind this is a small ""patio"" with 4 tables and seating for about 20 to enjoy your drinks outdoors. In front is a little seating area separated from the sidewalk by some planters so you can people watch.Below ground level are the service areas and also the dining room for the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast area is a little small and, while we were there, the crowd showed up between 8 and 9 so get there a little early if you don't want to wait. Breakfast was comparable to what I've usually seen at other hotels offering a ""complimentary"" breakfast; spinach in scrambled eggs, breakfast burritos, pancakes, oatmeal, sausage and toast & bagels on the hot side. Cold cereal, yoghurt, sweet breads and fruits on the cold side. The staff running it kept the hot food refreshed and kept it as clean as possible despite the crowd.The area is convenient to many destination sites in NY including Macy's and my favorite park for watching the world go by, Herald Square, right around the corner. It was a $10 cab ride, including tip, to Radio City Music Hall where graduation was located. There are plenty of dining places within a block of the hotel including a ""Pure & Fresh"" two doors down where we were delighted with the food.Overall, our stay was quite satisfactory. Thanks to Bebe & especially Robert at the front desk for helping us get in and out quickly, answering our questions and for cheering for my graduating son when he met us in the lobby. They are great staff and hope management rewards their customer service.","Findlay, Ohio",10,5.0

It was 34 degrees when we were there and the air conditioning worked very well. The breakfast is included and it exceeded my expectations. It’s not anything fancy, but there is toast, cereal, bagels, yogurt, tea & coffee, and hot food too such as eggs, sausage, hash browns, and French toast. The breakfast room is a bit small and we had to wait a few minutes one day, but not any other day. The location is terrific - we walked to everything - and the subway is a block away. The hotel is very close to lots of shopping as well, and to the Empire State Building. The only drawback is a bit of noise, not from outside but from in the hallways and the room next door. We could hear the hairdryer going. No one was partying though so it wasn’t a huge deal to us to periodically hear other people. All in all I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.

We were in a studio room on the top floor (17th).Right from arrival this hotel is amazing for the price. Location is fantastic - 2 mins walk to the subway, 5th Avenue, and the giant Macy’s Department Store in Herald Square. 5 mins to the Empire State Building. 5 mins to Broadway and Times Square. We walked everywhere, but there are boundless options for public transport, taxis, Uber, and hop-on-hop-off buses within a very short walking distance.The hotel itself is very tidy, with new fittings, comfy beds and linen, TV with an excellent range of channels (we like to catch up on HBO when in the US). Our room was small, but very comfortable and lots of dresser drawers and a wardrobe to put things out of the way. The bathroom was proportionately very spacious however! Our room looked out at offices across the road. Blackout curtains and ear plugs supplied by the hotel made for a great night’s sleep.Breakfast is free daily - a reasonable selection of cereals, hot dishes that change daily, yoghurts, bread and filter coffees. If this doesn’t appeal, there are delis galore in the neighbourhood to fill up before heading out for the day or get supplies. A 24 hr deli is 2 mins walk. (Wholefoods is also nearby at Bryant Park - 10 mins walk max).Free copies of the NY Times and USA today are also available.There is a small bar onsite, with a happy hour that seems to last from opening to 9pm. Free coffee, water, and tea is also available in the lobby. The only negatives I could point to (and they are pretty small really) are that the water pressure in the shower was virtually non existent, and air in the pipes meant the flow of hot water could be inconsistent in both shower and bathroom sink. The air conditioning unit was similarly a little quirky - it works well generally but can sometimes blow cool air for no apparent reason, so if you get cold at night like me, ask for extra duvets - the hotel is very happy to supply these. To make it absolutely perfect, a small fridge would have been great so we could keep things like yoghurt and drinks in our room, but with so many things available nearby it was only ever a matter of minutes to pick up supplies.

I called, and the head of housekeeping checked the lost and found for me, but said they didn't have it. I know this was my mistake but it seems like when they came to clean my room, someone would have found it and they could have called me based on the booking information.

Arriving on a flight from Newark means that the NJ Rail into Penn Station and then a nice 10-15 minutes walk to the hotel. This was the main reason that we chosee this hotel. Bedrooms: We had a standard queen room that comes with a 160 cm bed. Apart from the normal ameneties the hotel offers very comfy beds. Free wifi is of course include in the room rate. Breakfast: Finally we found a hotel that use regular cutlerys and plates instead of the paper/and plastic ones that too many other hotels in the US use. The breakfast included a selection of breads, danish, yoghurt and hot items. For sure one of the best breakfast I've had in the U.SI would recomend this hotel to those that are looking for a central located in the very heart of Midtown. One good thing is that you can walk from the Penn Station to this hotel without to use the metro.","Stockholm, Sweden",9,4.0

Our room was small and somewhat expensive, but less so than most other similar places I checked out. The room was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, and the decor was nice enough. My one complaint is that there was no mini fridge to store bottled water or restaurant leftovers. We drove our own car and parked it at one of the two public lots that are located very close to the hotel, only half a block away. We didn't use it again until the day we drove home. The Empire State Building is two blocks away from this hotel, Times Square and Broadway are walking distance, and Museum Mile is a short, easy subway ride from Herald Square. This location really is great! Breakfast is included in the price of the room, and was good each morning we tried it. Hot food including eggs, meats and pancakes were available, as well as fruit, pastries, coffee, juice and so on. The dining room is just as tiny as the hotel and the rooms, but the friendly staff makes it work for everyone.The staff was probably the best part of our experience. Everyone from the front desk clerks to the housekeepers was friendly and happy to answer questions, provide service, give directions and suggestions, or get whatever you need.

The only negative with this hotel is that the lift is noisy - we could hear it every night from our room. And you could hear noise from outside until around 4am.

Breakfast was simple, both hot and cold foods, and the nice thing is that it begins at 6:30 am for those needing to be up and about early. I would definitely stay here again. My only complaint is that I called the front desk for a wake-up call the night before I left and the nice gentleman who answered told me he would put in 2 calls a few minutes apart, just in case. I never got either call. Fortunately, I had also set my phone alarm and the wake-up call was a back-up.

The staff on reception were really welcoming on arrival and we quickly settled into our room. The room was a decent size, big enough for 2 queen beds with enough room to walk around and came with a desk, chest of drawers and a single wardrobe. The room also has a coffee machine (or hot water boiler) and a bathroom with toilet, sink and huge shower. There was a huge range of toiletries provided including face wipes, body lotion, ear buds and even shoe shine wipes. Be aware that the wardrobe space is largely cosmetic as it houses the safe, iron and ironing board. The bar area is small and there are only a few chairs but the barman Steve is a brilliant guy and looks after you really well. Drinks are reasonably priced and are not watered down and I'm sure in the summer its a really lovely space but one wall is made of glass doors and it was quite chilly overall. One thing to note is that the bar is NOT open on a Saturday so if you want a drink you'll have to go elsewhere.One of the reasons I chose this hotel was for the breakfast, for me this was where the hotel really fell short of expectations. On our first visit it seemed like there was plenty of choice but as the week went on we realised it eas actually quite basic. There was plenty of continental choice but the hot food was weak and although they were advertised, not once in 6 days did we see any waffles and when we asked for them we were told that the hotel couldn't get hold of them. Seriously? You can't get hold of a waffle in New York? Total let down. On the last day we chose to go out and pay for breakfast as that was the only way we were going to get a waffle at all. The staff in the breakfast room were also less than helpful and one in particular gave off a definite air of wanting to be somewhere or anywhere else! If all you want is a quick bite, I'd recommend the brioche loaf but wear a coat - the room is freezing.....Overall I would stay again and I would recommend the hotel but I'm not convinced that it's as good as it could or should be.Final note : check under your bed, ours had a thin layer of mould growing which we didn't notice until the last day.

The room I had was very clean,especially the bathroom,and housekeeping coming in each day kept it that way.The bed sheets were also very clean and no complaints at all.They were whiter than white in other words.The breakfast room was opened each morning @ 6.30am.I never have a cooked breakfast so everything I wanted was here.Just as at home I did not do without my daily bowl of porridge during my stay here + a few slices of toast and tea I was ok for the day.There were also 3 types of cereals to choose from,as well as brown or white bread + yoghurts in the fridge.You selected your own.Cooked breakfast was also available to anyone who wanted one.I can't make any comment about the lounge as I never frequent them,and can't comment about their evening menu as I generally always eat out when I am away from home.However their menu on display @ reception looked fine to me.There is only one small negative point I need to make and that is the tea/coffee making device{I can't recall its proper name now}in my room.I couldn't quite get my head round it after I had checked in,but I finally managed to produce for myself a cup of tea.Due to it being a fiddly little device it was the only cup I had.I think I may be right in saying that people from the UK prefer a kettle.Now there are available on the market small plastic kettles which are only big enough for 1 or 2 cups of tea/coffee. which I think most people would find more useful.Outside the hotel there are plenty of shops,as well as an Irish pub which I called into most days as I was able to have dinner from home.Macy's department store is just around the corner,and Penn station where you can get your NYC transporter bus back to JFK,is only 3 streets away.About a 10 minute walk.I couldn't finish off this review without saying something about my room which some people might think funny,and I suppose it is comical,althought its not supposed to be, and that is that everytime I switched on my TV set it would automatically retune itself to my favorite channel CNN.What better reminder of home could I have than that!!",United Kingdom,10,5.0

Rooms are typical NYC room sizes, meaning small but who spends any time in their room in NYC? There were some issues that I didn’t mind as much because I was on a work trip, but I think if I had paid for the room myself, I likely would’ve minded about a few of the cons below.First the pros:• Decent breakfast selection of hot and cold items, and a staff that kept the food and beverages replenished;• Lobby has 24-hour iced water and hot water for tea, a nice welcome after a long day of being out and just needing a quick drink upon returning to the hotel;• Comfortable bed;• Fairly good sized bathroom with a nice shower with good water pressure; and• Lots of HBO channels available.Now the cons:• Rooms are not cleaned sufficiently – when I walked into the room after checking in, I noticed stuff on the carpet that clearly had not been vacuumed, and housing keeping did not vacuum during my stay as the trash remained on the carpet;• Four pillows were provided and all four were pretty bad – I’m not picky about my pillows much, but these pillows did not keep their shape and were weirdly lumpy, so when laid on them, they would instantly deflate from under your head; and• The gym is tiny with one elliptical, one treadmill, one recumbent bike, one bench that is bolted to the floor, dumbbells, and a weight machine. Although it would have been nice had the gym been bigger, the size of the gym is not why I marked it as a con. The con came from the treadmill. I used the treadmill one morning for a warmup, and even just walking on it, my feet were slipping when I increased the speed. It was noticeable enough that I didn’t feel comfortable jogging or running for fear that I might really slip and break my face. It’s not a brand of treadmill I’ve seen before, Hotel Fitness brand or something to that effect, and it was a Green Series. I wondered if being “green” made the treadmill belt more slippery than regular treadmills.","Washington, DC",10,3.0

I struck the jackpot! I will address some of the negatives I read in the reviews, and then list my review...My adult son and I stayed for a week in a room with 2 double beds on the 8th floor.The pillows were very comfortable, and there were many on each bed. The only time we had to wait an appreciable amount of time for an elevator was during morning rush as people were going to/from breakfast or checking out. We took the stairs a couple times, and it wasn't terrible. The breakfast area was small, but the staff was amazing at clearing tables and keeping food stocked. One time we loaded our plates and ate on their back terrace - it was actually relaxing and beautiful.There was traffic noise outside, but the hotel had ear plugs on the desk. My son used the earplugs, but I didn't. I did not find the noise offensive. There were a couple of times that the noise woke me up, but not often, and I quickly went back to sleep.My observations: The hotel is in a fantastic location. A quick walk to many attractions, and close to subway or other transportation. I felt very safe walking, and there were many times when we were out after midnight.The hotel staff was tremendously helpful. They recommended different restaurants, how to navigate transportation, and when we checked out, they called the cab, told us the rate to expect, and told us to sit and relax in their lobby until the cab arrived. They have a ""hydration station"" in the lobby that always had ice water, coffee, hot water for tea, etc.The room was small, but we had enough room. We didn't come to NYC to stay in the room. The beds were comfortable - firmness of mattress and linens. The climate control was great. The shower had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. It was a large walk-in shower. There was a small countertop, as well as a shelf over the toilet, so items could be left in the bathroom.The complimentary breakfast was wonderful. There were constant items (fresh fruit - Apples and bananas, yogurt, 3 or 4 different types of dry cereal, whole and 2% milk, hot oatmeal, breads and bagels, coffee/tea/juices). Other items that were rotated included pancakes, sausage, bacon, hard boiled eggs, French toast, omelets or scrambled eggs, etc. As I said, the staff was very efficient at clearing tables and insuring the food was stocked.The front patio and rear patio were relaxing. We enjoyed sitting out on a regular basis.If we travel back to NYC, I know where we will stay...in a heartbeat!!","Mattoon, Illinois",5,5.0

There is only one caveat.The breakfasts served was very good - a great selection with hot and cold dishes - but, when I stayed the queues were long each morning as the dining area is really too small.

First some good things; location is really good, a lot of TV channels and the bed was also okay. Room was very small, but I expected that. BUt I would never ever stay here again. I've never before been to such a noisy hotel. The elevator is something out of a nightmare. It makes the strangest noises I've ever heard. And you literally wake up from it (every floor seems to have around 5 rooms, and they are all near the elevator). Ours was just opposite the elevator doors. As I said, every time someone uses the elevator (which happens a lot, especially in the morning), it makes very loud clicking sounds. Hard to explain, but absolutely terrible. Then early in the morning housekeeping starts. They are extremely loud and the walls are really thin. You can hear everything. They vacuum early in the morning, it's like they vacuum in your room. I am having a hard time remembering a hotel where I had a worse' nights sleep. Of course I mentioned this multiple times to the front desk, they couldn't have cared less. One of them even asked me, in which room I was...she then said ""ah, that room..."". So not sure if mine was just especially awful, but especially the noise in the hotel couldn't just have been in my room. We even spoke about it with some other hotel guets, everyone heard it. Which is why I'm suprised about all the good reviews here. Another bad thing is the breakfast. Buffet is bad and the room is extremely small and always super crowded.

The reception when we walked in was friendly and helpful, a kind of ""welcome to our house"" friendly. The lobby has complimentary coffee and a huge container of ice water with lemon. NY was hot when we visited so the ice water was much appreciated. Our room was not large but it was larger than some rooms I've had in NYC. It was clean and attractive. The air conditioner was not a noisy window shaker; it seemed to come out around the ceiling. The bathroom was actually bigger than the one in my home with a huge shower area. There is a free breakfast with dry cereal, fresh oatmeal, pancakes (my personal favorite), sweet rolls, bagels, coffee, tea, orange juice. There were 4 serving units and 2 of them were varied each day. It was great. I had to go back to the room to get my umbrella and the Housekeeper was working on our room. We talked a bit and as we left she said, ""Thank you for staying at our hotel"". The ""our"" says it all; the people who work there really want you to come back. It is on 36th Street so you're about 10 short blocks from Times Square. But, you are also away from the flashing lights and the noise. The nights were quiet (except for a minute when the garbage truck came through, but that's true everywhere, isn't it?) We were on the 6th floor and were very pleased with our whole experience. Oh, and the elevators are speedy so you won't wait 20 minutes for one to appear. Did I say how much I enjoyed staying here?

On the way back stopped at Karako Suits a mens clothing/suit store with personalized service. We love our room! We booked the executive king,16th floor so no street noice, with a little more space, floor to ceiling windows, street view. It gives us a ""penthouse"" feel, well worth the extra cost.

Many other things we will enjoy I'm sure like the streetside outdoor area, bar and inside patio courtyard. Tomorrow we try out the breakfast in the hotel that is included.

Perfectly located close to everything you want to see but not to close to be in the hustle and bustle of time square.

Breakfast included helps to get you on your way first thing in the morning. A nice seating area outfront on the street side. The rooms are small from what I am use to but they are clean and that's what counts the most to me. The staff were very good to us from checkin to checkout. I don't have any complaints. We used uber to and from the airport and also to get us to battery park to take the Statue of Liberty tour. We walked everywhere else because it was easy to do so and you get to see more by walking. We were only there for two full days with two days of travel and we did lots. Planned our first day and sort of took the second day as it came.

We had tickets for Phantom and wanted to spend a good few days in the city to take in the sites and I wanted to find a hotel that was not only clean (a much more difficult task in NYC than you might assume) and in a safe spot, but also that gave her that incredible NYC experience. Cue the Best Western @ Harald Square! I purposefully booked one of the rooms at the top of the hotel so we could have those amazing views! The room was smaller than ones you'll find on lower floors, but still considered roomie for NYC standards, and if you're with someone you don't mind sharing a bed with, this is the room to book! A king bed with wall-to-wall floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a lovely and classic NYC skyline view. It was spectacular! The room was also very quiet considering you're in the heart of the city. We heard very little street noise, and that includes trash pick-up! There was a bit of noise from the elevators going up and down, as we were on the top floor and nearest to the cables pulling the elevators up and down, but we were so tired from our busy day of sightseeing that we fell asleep regardless! They do provide you with ear plugs (like any good NYC hotel does!) for those of you who are sensitive to all sounds. We were presented with a BOGO free on drinks at the cute little bar they have at the back of the hotel and we enjoyed happy hour before getting ready to head out on the town that evening! I will admit that breakfast was a bit lack luster on the hot-food department, but they still provided all the basics (cereal, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurt, and pastries) and it was sufficient enough to keep us full until a late lunch could be had. Finally, the hotel was very clean and comfortable, and every single staff member we came across, from the cleaning crew to the front desk were very very nice and accommodating!

Searching for hotels in New York is like searching for one perfect needle in a whole stack of almost equally good needles. You will have lots of choices all over the place and no clear cut reason as to why you should chose one over the other. To make my search easier, I decided to go with the following requirements - in Manhattan, a known hotel brand, breakfast included, free Wifi and close to Metro/Subway. Best Western Herald Square stood out among the finalists! Rooms and the hotel itself is quite small and compact, but given it is Manhattan, this is acceptable. It was clean and the beds plush and comfortable. Bathroom was not too tight. The rooms do not have a kitchenette, so that is something you should take into account. I was worried of the vehicle noise factor, given that the hotels are right on the street, but surprisingly it was not an issue, even though we were in the 3rd floor. There was more people noise on a Friday evening as there are a few bars/restaurants close by. But nothing unbearable. But be aware that higher floors may have some motor noise from the water pump when it is running.Breakfast was ok, not great, but enough to fill your stomach till lunch - oatmeal, cereal, few assorted pastries, pancakes. The breakfast hall is a little small, so expect some wait time during peak hours.Service is excellent - at the lobby, breakfast hall, housekeeping. No issues there.34th Street/Herald Square Subway station is just 5 minutes walk away with good connections. Penn Street station is also close by. If you are new to New York Subway, there is a very good introduction to it right here on Tripadvisor - search for ""The Idiot's Guide to the Subway"".Empire state building is a 5 minute walk and so is Macys, the world's biggest store, right at Herald Square. Times Square is about 15 minutes walk. Many restaurants are nearby.If you have a car, parking in NYC is pretty expensive. Park in ""Mayer's Parking"", just a couple of buildings further down from the Hotel on the same street, on the right side. Validate the parking ticket at the lobby. You will get a discounted rate of $39 per night. Anywhere else, it will be $50 or more per night. If you don't need a car, I would say do not get it. You do not need it in NYC. Subway and the buses takes you where ever you want to go. They are well connected with very good frequency.All in all, this is a good place to stay in Manhattan. You will not regret it.","Bengaluru, India",61,4.0

I normally stay away from chain hotels in NYC, but took a chance with this. Location-wise, it worked out great. There are several subway lines nearby, and it is a short walk from Penn Station. The hotel itself seems very new. When you look at the hotel from the outside, it is very much a new meets old with the surrounding buildings. The check-in lobby is a bit small. The rooms are also a bit small. For an overnight stay, it wasn't much of a bit deal. But for a multi-night stay, you should ask for a larger room.

The good half is that Best Western is located in a great central location, if you’re visiting New York for business or pleasure. The metro is just 5 mins away, along with Macy’s, the Gap and H & M among my other favourites. For any of you coffee addicts like me, good news there’s a Starbucks nearby, meaning you don’t have to go far for your daily caffeine hit. This was my second visit having previously visited last year and if I’m honest a last minute.com choice, as my other two first options were fully booked. Inside the lobby, I was welcomed by reception. I have to commend the reception staff, as for the second time I found them welcoming, friendly and professional. I double-checked that I’d been booked into a king executive room, having experienced the annoyance on my previous visit, of having a Queen room booked for me and arriving to find it was an accessible room, a fact not mentioned online.  My room was on the 17th floor, directly opposite the lift ensuring I was fully conversant with the sound of the hoover, slamming of room doors and any lively conversations that took place beside the lift. The absence of soundproofing was pretty shocking in an establishment of this rating level. My room was a decent size and as I entered the room I was greeted by a green croc topped size stool, which was directly beside wall mounted power points, alongside a desk and a great chair. Why mention a chair, well let’s just take this as my direct read to all those hotels out there, that have crappy chairs to go with their desks. It’s like being punished because you want to work in your room. All too often, comfort is sacrificed to keep room budgets in check, but to the comfort detriment of their customers. The Western’s chair was leather, comfortable with a decent back support meaning I had a place other than on my bed to take my morning calls and have my coffee while I worked. The table lamp was also winner with a decent bulb wattage and integrated power points. On the desk a hospitality tea tray – the selection was adequate but lacked fruit tea and no milk, just one powder creamer sachet, which I only discovered when I unwrapped one of the three multi packs of sugar and stirrer sets provided. I have to reinforce the lack of milk again – beyond annoying for any guest, but as a Brit who loves a nice afternoon cup of tea, it was frankly unacceptable and another sign of rash budget cutting. The TV didn’t disappoint large and the stations offered were beyond diverse allowing me to entertain myself with a hearty selection of guilty pleasure TV. My bed was so darned comfortable, I had little desire to leave it any time soon :)Best of all was the view like my own New York movie, up on the rooftops, allowing me to look down on this bustling metropolis. The bad half of my review right here. The eagled eyed among you, must be wondering why I didn’t mention the bathroom. For me unfortunately, this was scored by me with a crater sized black mark for several reasons. While the basics - a reasonable sized sink, space to put your toiletries and enough towels were clearly on show. The essential element to any bathroom  – decent water pressure was most definitely AWOL. I noticed it right away, when I went to brush my teeth. The water spat, sprayed and gurgled its way out of the tap violently, like it was being pushed out under duress. I had to run the water for several minutes to establish a decent water flow and the same unfortunate experience happened with the shower – diminishing the joy of morning wake-up !  Also absent was shower gel. Instead I was ‘treated’ to one boxed, soap tablet in the shower and a further two by the sink – talk about wasteful. The shower décor was just ish for me.  I noted that the bathroom cubicle door opened out, instead of in, the insulator protector at the bottom of the door was coming away and the bathroom floor was so dull and uninteresting, it really could have done with being replaced. Breakfast was a bleak affair, tired looking pastries and coffee - served downstairs in a room which had all the warmth of a hospital waiting room. I turned on my heel and straight out of the hotel for better offsite alternatives. While I know increasingly few NY hotels offer ‘free’ breakfast, if you can’t do it to a decent standard, then I my humble opinion, you shouldn’t do it at all. Location wise Best Western is definitely a great place to stay in New York. terms of value for money in my opinion, it’s too expensive for what it is. Either up your game guys or drop your prices which would be instantly manage guests’ expectations of what to expect from your establishment.","London, United Kingdom",69,3.0

Firstly the location of the hotel was great, we didn't use the subway once as everywhere was in walking distance and we used the hop on hop of bus to go down and up town. The room was cleaned brilliantly every day, beds were really comfy, wonderful big shower in bedroom. The breakfast was great with different choices each day! The only criticism of breakfast would be the room is very small, and this meant we woke up early to make sure we could get a table and didn't have to que up and wait around for a free table. The staff were friendly and helpful in showing us how to get around town and back to JFK via penn station, so much cheaper than a taxi and very quick and easy! Another great feature is the tea/coffee/water in the foyer which you can help your self to at any time. The room was quiet throughout the night, our only complaint would be as we were on the second floor at times loud music would play from the hotel next door which was a bit annoying, but most of the time we didn't hear it as we were out/it wasn't playing. 100% would recommend.

Have had luck with other Best Westerns and decided to give this one a try. I was not disappointed. The location is ideal (easy walk to Penn Station, theater district, Times Square, etc) but on a quieter side street (36th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues). Met friendly and helpful staff throughout our stay. Rooms were New York tiny, but immaculate and provided all essentials. Beds were comfortable. Great views of the Empire State Building out 17th floor window. Expansive hot breakfast was complimentary and there was a bar in the back. Though I didn't use it, I was given a card for a free second drink. The only negatives I have were relatively minor and both involved the elevator..there was a very long wait for the elevator after breakfast (2 elevators, 17 floors and everyone going to and from breakfast at the same time) and a weird banging from the elevator shaft that other reviewers mentioned. The only time the banging was bothersome was early in the morning when the elevator was in frequent use going to breakfast. It sounded like someone was bouncing a ball against the wall outside our room. Once I realized where the noise was coming from, I could ignore it. My grandson slept through it and never heard it at all. Great ""grab food"" eat in/take out place a couple of doors down was helpful as well. Final tally-reasonable NYC price became better with breakfast savings and walkable location. Would definitely stay here again, even with the elevator noise.","Hendersonville, North Carolina",8,5.0

The maid cleaned one day and moved my SIM card and part of my phone which was a big problem (I was advised by Vodafone to take my sim out for a few hours as it hadn't been working) when I got back to the room the cleaner had cleaned and the sim and part of iPhone was missing and all our stuff had been moved, I found the sim on the floor but couldn't find that sim holder. The hotel looked for it too, but couldn't find it, it was on top on my phone and should never have been moved. I then had to spend part of my stay in the apple shop, they don't stock the parts so had to buy a cheap iphone as I need to make calls for work while away. The hotel paid for our cab back to JFK which while was a great gesture which I appreciated didn't cover the $200 phone. I had read other reviews before I booked and people mentioned the noisy lifts, they are a little noisy but I think I only noticed them as I had read the reviews as my mum didn't. The noise I did notice however was the ice machine been used at 5:30am EVERY morning on the dot! One morning I grumpily stormed out of bed to have a look and realised it was a member of staff using the machine, very inconsiderate! I can understand the ice machine having to be used by at 5:30am that's a little too early for my liking! I also read reviews saying rooms were small but ours was a great size! Huge bed, big shower, great view! Overall the stay wasn't bad and I would probably stay again as I think my experience with my phone was obviously a one off even though I don't like the maid moving my stuff, the hotel were apologetic and tried to make it up to me. I would just recommend the hotel telling their staff not to use the ice machine that early!If you want a great location at reasonable prices choose this hotel! ","Sheffield, United Kingdom",4,3.0

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable! They helped us out with everything from great local eating places to how to get around in the city. The continental breakfast was filling, complete with hot and cold items. However my wife and I chose Chick-fil-A two blocks away most mornings. The Empire State Building is two blocks down and one block over. Entrance to the Subway (34th and Herald Square) was just two blocks away. Macy's, H&M, Forever 21, etc are right at the subway stop. Times Square is just one more stop down on the subway (2 min ride). The location was perfect!!! The rooms made great use of the space allotted to them. Although they were quaint they didn't seem cramped. They were very clean all the way down to the remote control. The cleaning staff was kind and helpful!The only downside was a clanging noise that came from the elevator shaft. The noise could be heard every time the elevators moved. It was not overwhelmingly loud and did not keep us up at night but you could hear it in the room. Again, the front desk provided us with earplugs when we called down to ask about the noise.

Never been to New York or America before so was really looking forward to going with my partner.Location: The hotel was roughly 1.5 hours away from JFK airport (depending on traffic). We got a shared shuttle from the airport which dropped us off right near the hotel. The hotel was easy to find, big sign to indicate. We entered in and were greeted kindly by the staff (they also commented on how they loved our accents which made us smile). The hotel is about 10 minute walk from Times Square, 5 minutes from Empire State Building and 2 minutes from the department store Macys. I felt that the location was perfect and everything was within walking distance. Plenty of places to eat near the hotel as well and gift shops too!Room: Our room was on the 7th floor and unfortunately we had the view into an alley which was a shame as we would've liked to have a front room. However, the room was just right for our trip. It was quiet and cosy, wasn't expecting a massive room due to the size of New York city. King size bed with really soft and comfortable pillows. Big TV with plenty of channels but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway. The shower was amazing, had different settings and the right temperature. There is also a safe in the wardrobe for free. WIFI is also free so another perk that got us to book this hotel. Food: Breakfast was included in the package deal which was good as most New York hotels don't include this. The food left much to be desired but I wouldn't complain about it as it was included and saved us a few extra quid. The hot food changed every day, pancakes, oatmeal (porridge to me) and egg/bacon/sausage. There were pastries, cereal, fruit etc. Complimentary water, tea and coffee are offered in the reception area. Extra: The staff were very helpful with organising us things to do in New York. We organised the package deal with the Big Bus Tour company which included uptown, downtown, Brooklyn and night bus tours, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island tour with audio, 9/11 memorial tour and bike ride rental. Due to our tight schedule and weather, we only took advantage of the uptown and downtown tour and Statue of Liberty. Definitely recommend asking about booking this. We even paid some at the hotel and the rest to the company (who you will see walking around Times Square). The staff also helped me with ringing the shared shuttle the night before our departure to confirm timing, All were really polite and lovely so please give my thanks to them. (can't remember names sadly!).I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, especially to those travelling to New York for the first time. It made one of my bucket list items the most amazing experience of my life and I would love to return one day! WORD OF ADVICE: Be prepared to tip! America is very into tipping and even though i expected it, it was a shock to experience as tipping isn't a norm in the UK and it did make our trip more expensive.","London, United Kingdom",29,5.0

There are several subway lines just 1-2 blocks away and many attractions are in a walking distance.So why do I believe it was poor? Well, first of all the breakfast was terrible. Disposable plates, poor selection and tasteless food did not impress us at all. Staff was in general minding their own business - sure they were helpful when they had to but I didn't feel that they put an extra effort in.

After reading many reviews I had emailed the hotel ahead of arrival requesting a room on a high floor (the hotel has 17 floors) with a view of the Empire State building. We were not disappointed! The view was fantastic and didn't get old all week - seeing it first thing against a bright blue sky, at sunset, in pitch black and even in low cloud. A big thank you to the hotel for accommodating this request.The room matched up to the view and we were delighted. Expecting a small room from reading previous reviews our room was a great surprise. With two of us travelling (Mum and daughter) we booked a double room with two double beds. The beds were extremely comfortable, we found space for our cases, between the wardrobe and the large chest of drawers there was more than ample space for our clothes, the beds were extremely comfortable and the room definitely boasts the most sockets of any hotel I've ever stayed in. The bathroom was also a great size with a double width, powerful shower, many toiletries and vanity mirror. Our room had always been cleaned when we returned mid-late afternoon. The hotel has two lifts which we found to be quiet and speedy. Like with anything, at busier times could be a bit of a wait with the lift stopping at many floors but we're talking a couple of minutes if that!Breakfast was the biggest surprise. Having breakfast included in the room rate was one of the reasons that we chose this hotel. We had planned on grabbing something quick each morning before heading out for a more substantial breakfast/brunch but the high quality and huge variety of the breakfast on offer in the hotel meant we instead filled up every day on fresh bagels, breads, pastries, cooked options (which changed daily) including porridge, hash browns, bacon, sausage patties, pancakes and waffles. Cereals and fruit were also available. The juice was gorgeous - freshly squeezed and the coffee was amazing. Others have mentioned the small size of the breakfast room. We never had any problem getting a table straight away and visited breakfast at varying peak times from 7.30 - 8.30am. Sometimes there were queues but there's plenty of space in reception and in the lounge or you could even take your food to your room! Worth the wait if you have one anyway.Sticking with refreshments, we loved the iced water and coffee facilities in the reception area. We made great use of this during our stay, always filling up our bottles before heading out on a morning or grabbing a coffee for a mid-afternoon re-charge. The coffee was the same great quality as in the breakfast room and this was a lovely touch!The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. Sandwiched between 6th Avenue (Avenue of the Americas) and 5th Avenue you're never more than a few minutes’ walk from bars, cafes or restaurants (there's a Starbucks and a McDonalds just around the corner). On West 36th Street itself, across the road, there's a great Irish Bar if you get torrential rain like we did and just want to make a run for it - tasty food and drinks, huge portions, reasonable prices and a great atmosphere. Just a 5 minute walk from 34th Street Herald Square Subway station serving most of the major lines and Penn Station not much further along the street, this hotel is amazingly located for exploring the whole of Manhattan and beyond! We did a lot of walking to explore the city on foot: Times Square is approximately 20 minutes away and just a little further is the Rockefeller Centre. You're just 5 minutes away from the entrance to the Empire State Building, Macy's and Monarch Rooftop Bar on top of the Marriott (recommended for cocktails and amazing views of the Empire State!) . And if you head up 5th Avenue towards Central Park in no time you'll take in the library as well as Grand Central Station. It was our first time in New York and the location of this hotel just made everything so easy. Being on a slightly quieter street was great too - not being immediately thrust into the bustle but still with everything on your doorstep!This hotel is fantastic and made our holiday in New York a dream.

Location was excellent for all the sights of Midtown and the subway. The hotel itself was clean, the staff friendly and for the price paid I guess you could call this a budget Manhattan hotel. We generally book 4 star and above hotels but we went with the good reviews on trip advisor and decided to give this hotel a go. Note at this stage, our room was booked and paid for well in advance in February and our stay wasn't taken until October. The room we were given was of adequate size for Manhattan. We were only on the 3rd floor so the traffic/general noise from the road outside could still be heard but not too badly. We were a bit disappointed that as we'd booked so far in advance that the 3rd floor room at the front of the hotel was all we were offered but aside from this the room was OK. We had a problem with a group who were staying in the adjacent room who didn't think anything of having a full blown argument and swearing in the lobby outside our room at 2am. We called reception and the member of staff on duty came up and sorted them out without drawing attention that it was us that had complained. We were impressed with this service given - too bad that the idiots in the room next door had woken us up in the middle of the night! This was not the fault of the hotel but I wouldn't expect this kind of behaviour in a 4 or 5 star hotel so maybe it is to be expected in a 3 star, who knows. The inclusive breakfast was just OK. The first day there were no seats at all so we had to take the food back to our room, the second day the place was empty so I guess you just have to be lucky. There is a small gym at the hotel but no one seemed to use it so we thought that the hotel could make better use of the space by extending the dining room into that space maybe? Our main concern with the breakfast was the disposable plates and cutlery. We are surprised in this day and age that a chain like Best Western can be so un-environmentally friendly. They had staff bringing out the food and beverages so why not invest in a dishwasher and get proper crockery/cutlery!!All in all this was an OK hotel but probably not one that we'd rush back to.

Our room on the 17th floor was quiet, attractive, and the beds were comfortable. The air conditioning worked well. We had a view of the Empire State Building, which was particularly striking at night. Bebe at the front desk is very congenial and helpful. We booked at this hotel based on the positive ratings, location, free Wifi, and breakfast (which represents a daily savings of $30 to $60 for us). As a family with older children, there were definitely two downsides to this hotel. First, our double room was so cramped that only one person at a time could walk around the beds. Sitting in the desk chair with someone (relatively tall) in the bed behind you meant being kicked in the back. The space issue was compounded by a relatively small wardrobe closet and the luggage rack in the opposite corner of the room. Second, as many have noted, the breakfast area is congested and poorly arranged. There were daily problems with finding a table for four of us. In my humble opinion, the area for toasting bread/bagels should be moved to a separate table to prevent bottlenecks and the chairs in the room should be changed out for smaller ones. It's awesome to have breakfast on site and included in the cost of your room, but there was a moderate amount of unpleasantness with the breakfast experience. On a positive note, the orange juice was very good and I appreciated that there was hot oatmeal most mornings.We visited the lounge one evening, which was a good experience. The bartender was friendly and we enjoyed a hummus plate that was reasonably priced. Our hotel departure was smooth, with the front desk staff arranging car service to take us to the airport, though it was about double the cost of a yellow taxi.In summary, I would consider staying here again based on the location and cleanliness of the hotel, as well as proximity to dozens of reasonably priced ethnic dining options, but I would look at other hotel options that may allow more space within the room for our family.","Oshkosh, Wisconsin",27,4.0

This was my first visit to the US so not sure if there is a different rating system for Best Westerns in the US. The hotel is located in a great location on 36W, which is a five minute walk to the Empire State Building and about 10 minutes walk to Times Square. The location makes it a great choice base to explore the city from. The hotel bar is also great with a happy hour that finishes at 8pm when all beers are $4. Some good bottled craft beers to be had. These are the positives about the hotel. The check-in process was good enough but there was no recognition of customer loyalty from the staff. I am a diamond select member but was not offered any welcome gift or a room upgrade, not so much as a thanks for being a loyal BW customer. I expected a little more from a 'Premier' BW. Our King size bedroom on the 16th floor was clean and comfortable. A bit on the small side but I guess this is to be expected in NYC. Again for a 'Premier' BW, I expected a mini-fridge and a small welcome gesture but this was not available. Sound-proofing could be better. Noise from the corridor and the room next door could be heard. The breakfast starts at 6.30 and finishes by 9.30. The variety is okay but could do with more options. The biggest disappoint was that the plates and cutlery were disposable plastic and paper cups for drinks and you are expected to clear up after you finish eating??!! Not a 'Premier' experience by any means. All in all, a disappointing experience for me as I was expecting something a bit more from a 'Premier' BW but maybe as I said the grading for Europe and US might be different!","Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",120,3.0

For travelers who do not walk a lot, bring good walking shoes and remember your feet will swell - so your normal shoes will not fit...be ready to walk at least 5 miles per day- but with the sights, it really doesn't seem that far. We averaged 9 miles per day and I had to buy shoes because my comfortable sketchers wouldn't fit my swollen feet! Buy the comfortable sandals that you can expand.

As I extended my stay, I had an insight into two King-size room: executive (very spicy for NY standards, on the upper floors) and standard (rather on the small side, which is normal for NYC). When sharing the standard room and you've done quite a bit of shopping it might be a little tight. There is a complimentary breakfast buffet, however I went once as it was so crazy crowded.

The two young ladies (Shameza and Bebe) who checked us in were very friendly and helpful. We also got our parking validated which took off $14 of the parking fee. They told us about some of the best places to watch the fireworks. We had a room on the 14th floor facing the back. Not much of a view but very quiet, which was needed after returning from the fireworks. We arrived back too late to eat but the front desk person, a young man, gave us the number to a 24hr pizza place and we were able to get it delivered to our room. Our room was small but it had two double beds, which slept comfortably. The room was clean and furnished with practical furniture--nothing exceptional. The bathroom likewise was small but towels were plentiful. Breakfast the next morning was sufficient as well.

The room is situated at the back of the hotel, is lovely & quiet and has a great view of the top of the empire state building. Part of the reason we chose this hotel was that it is one of the few that offers breakfast. There are hot dishes available and these change every day. Everything was good quality, I absolutely loved the orange juice. The breakfast room staff work really hard to keep things topped up but always had time for a smile & a good morning. One area of the hotel we only tried late in our stay was the bar. Happy hour(s) meant that a glass of wine was cheaper than in nearby bars and restaurants. Other lovely touches were tea, coffee & water in the lobby, free wi-fi throughout the hotel and a computer/printer situated near the breakfast room for printing tickets, boarding passes etc. Location is excellent with one of the many entrances to 34th Street Herald Square subway station on the corner of 35th Street & 6th Avenue.

The rooms were a bit on the small side, which was expected, but very well appointed at a reasonable rate for New York. A great shower and a very comfortable bed were greatly appreciated. There is a small patio out front where you can just sit and people watch as New Yorkers go about their daily business that catches the early morning sun. A breakfast buffet is provided daily that had a good selection of breads, buns, oatmeal, yogurt as well as bacon or sausage and eggs or pancakes.I can't fail to mention the little bar that is hidden in the back of the hotel. It is open from 3:00 to about 11:30 p.m. every day with happy hour specials from 3:00 to 8:00 p.m. And what can I say about the bartender, Steve! What an excellent bartender! Personable, great knowledge of mixed drinks, and also a wonderful advisor about things to do and places to go in New York. The other bartender who worked there was a very nice person, who served my girlfriend and I quite well but I felt she was not quite as tuned in to customer service as Steve. My girlfriend and I returned from a long day of exploring New York about 3:10 one day. We looked forward to going to the bar and relaxing with a glass of wine and much to our surprise, the bar wasn't yet open. We returned about 3:45 and went in for a drink , the bar was open by then but you could tell she hadn't quite finished her set up---luggage rack still in the middle of the bar, no flowers on the table yet.Apart from this little hiccup, it's a really good hotel to stay in.

There are tables outside the hotel that are often occupied by smokers which means you're often assaulted by the smell of cigarette smoke on the way in. The lobby is small but clean with dispensers of fruit infused water offering a nice touch. Now please note that hotel rooms everywhere in NYC are small. If you've not stayed in a big city before, this is something you're going to have to accept. Space is at a premium everywhere and that includes hotel rooms, so don't expect tons of space to sprawl out or much closet space. We had a room with one king bed and while the room wasn't tiny, it wasn't well designed. The space between the edge of the bed and the entertainment center was barely enough to roll your luggage past. Two people can't walk through it, you need to make room for each other. Another issue was in the bathroom where the door opens right at the sink, so if you want to stand at the sink, you need to have the bathroom door shut otherwise you're in for a tight squeeze. Finally, while it said we had a king size bed, it didn't seem like it. We have a king bed at home and my feet don't go to the edge whereas they did here. It was strange. The room itself was clean and the decor modern. The bed was comfortable. There was a good sized walk in shower with a good shower head. There's little closet space. Our room overlooked the street, not an exciting view although better than I've had in other hotels where you're basically looking right into another part of the building. Soundproofing left something to be desired, both with other rooms and with the street. Thankfully, I brought earplugs so waking up in the middle of the first night there to the sound of what was probably trash collectors, I popped them in and slept well the rest of the stay.Breakfast was included with a breakfast room in the basement. There were a good number of choices including eggs, rotating meat selection, pancakes, breads, sweets, yogurt, and fruit. The breakfast room could get crowded at times and we ended up bringing it up to the room one day as we couldn't find a spot. The basement also had a small excercise room that was ok.","Boston, Massachusetts",54,3.0

I know how difficult it is to find a hotel that is conveniently located, has all the basic amenities, is clean and modern, is affordable. I needed a room to share with 2 of my sisters. We booked a standard room with 2 double beds for 3 nights, and our stay exceeded our expectations. We have stayed at some more expensive hotels in the city that were truly disappointing, and at similarly priced ones that were not as good a value. The rooms are small, as most NY hotel rooms are, but they are clean, the beds and pillows are comfortable, linens are clean. The bathroom is small but clean and the shower is great. Breakfast was hot, and the variety exceeded expectations as well (I thought this was going to be a bread/bagels and some spreads + coffee kind of deal, but they served hot eggs and breakfast meats, an assortment of breads, oatmeal, fruit along with coffee/tea/milk/juice). The hotel is just around the block from Herald Square so convenient for walking around and taking the subway or bus. It is in close proximity to some wonderful restaurants (Keen's Steakhouse is a must) and great shopping, and just a few blocks from Bryant Park (where there is a Breads Bakery kiosk that serves the best babka in the city). If you have a lot of luggage, it may be a tight fit. We had 3 carry-on sized bags and 1 standard check-in sized bag among the 3 of us and it took some maneuvering to find a place for everything, but we managed. The room is probably more suited to 2 people than 3 or 4 (unless they are small children) but they did maximize the use of space. The location is noisy, but all of New York City is, and it didn't really bother me. In fact, I slept extremely well. The staff was wonderful - friendly and helpful. My one complaint is the ""free internet"" to which I never could connect. I didn't report the problem, opting to use my phone instead, but none of my sisters could connect either, and I felt somewhat cheated by the promise of free internet that didn't work. Overall, I was satisfied with my stay and would book a room here again. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a clean and affordable place to stay in the city. However, if an internet connection is a must, speak to the front desk beforehand just to make sure it really is working.","Burlington, United States",2,4.0

Check in was efficient and the lady on reception was extremely helpful when we need to change one of the rooms booked to a room with two beds as opposed to one bed.!Rooms are quite small, but I've stayed in smaller in Amsterdam and really it is just a place to sleep so no complaints there. Everything was very clean and we had a great view of the Empire State Building. The bathroom was also small but adequate for our needs and the toiletries were replaced every day. The shower was nice and large and falrly powerful - I have no complaints there. The tea/coffee items in rooms were also stocked up every day.The general appearance of hotel was clean and the restaurant for breakfast was kept very clean - I'm not sure of the environmental damage this hotel does with its plastic plates/utensils but that's their issue. The orange juice was probably one of the nicest I've had in hotels where OJ is included as it is usually just hideously sweet concentrated rubbish, but this was great.My only issues with this hotel were :Maintenance man - we had a problem with the safe and were told when we reported it at 7.50pm that someone would be up in ""5 minutes"" luckily we did not hold our breath as he turned up at 11.10pm when we were in bed - when we didn't answer he phoned the room and we told him to come back the following day. We rang at 7.30am the next morning and someone was there within 5 minutes so why this was not done the night before I cannot understand and I did not appreciate being called at 11.10pm - not exceptionally late but when you are on a time difference of 5 hours behind Ireland - it made a difference!!My other issue was the lifts! On the second morning one was not working and it was a long wait to get a lift that was not full. On my last day - we had to wait 20 minutes because again only one was working and the other was full of the maid's trolleys so we could not get in - if it wasn't for the fact I was on 16th floor with suitcases I would have walked down. I can appreciate the maid need their trolleys on each floor, but they should really put one trolley in at a time so guests can still get in - two trolleys when 1 lift is already out of service is ridiculous.I would however have no problems recommending this hotel and would definitely stay again. It's well located and has no bed bugs - which can be a worry in NY at even the best hotels!","Galway, Ireland",43,5.0

Not many people have mentioned the bed size but it was a big no from us. However lets get the positives out of the way first! Location - couldn't fault it - From JFK we got the Air train and then LIRR from Jamaica to Penn St then it was an easy 10 min walk to the hotel. Easy enough to do with luggage on way back too and LIRR takes 20 mins - $25 each return which included the air train ticket. Trains leave every 10 mins from Penn. Checkin - easy enough though they won't recognise your status if you book through an agent ( I got Diamond as I'm a platinum with IHG- they do a like for like). So no room upgrade etc. Check out is 11am but got it extended to 1.30pm. Rooms- we were facing out the back - quiet but no view. The first thing you notice is they are very small - understand this is a Manhattan thing but there was 3 of us and we felt cramped. The room was nice though and clean but hardly any storage space for us all. The main problem for us though was the beds (and this is the most important feature of a hotel room!) we had 2 very small doubles and I mean small- I am 5 ft 5 and my feet dangled over the end - you can imagine poor hubby at 6ft 2 had cold feet during our stay! We are all average or small build - if you are a bigger person this is not the hotel for you! The bedding was annoying - a sheet and very thin duvet - kept having to get up in night and sort it all. Pillows felt cheap and I woke every morning with a pain in my neck.Breakfast- it's ok - cheap and cheerful but set us up for the day. Cereals, pastries, 3 hot items, yogurts and fruit. Also coffee station in lobby and a small coffee maker in the room. Small bar out back with small outdoor space at back and front. 3 min walk to Macy's, the subway at Herald Sq. Very central. A couple of small cafes to the left and right of hotel for food. Can also recommend Diana's Nail and massage bar - just turn left out of hotel and she is up on west 39th st. $25 for a mani and a pedi and $10 for 20min back massage. No need to book. This was our second trip to NYC - was last there in Nov 2014 - that time we stayed at Springhill Suites by Marriot - was just on next street -37th. It was similar but far more spacious rooms and 2 kingsize beds perhaps slightly more expensive but if we were to return or recommend to friends we would recommend the Springhill Suites over this one. Don't normally stay at Best Westerns - not sure I would hurry back. It was ok but just not brilliant I'm afraid. I just can't believe no one really warned us of the very small beds on here!

Only a block from the big Macy's, and fairly close to Times Square, Broadway theaters, Penn Station - and all the shopping in mid-town Manhattan.The hotel itself is fairly new - and it shows. Everything is clean and well-appointed. Beware that it's SMALL - very small. One room for a family is really stretching things.The free breakfast was busy. The room is in the basement below the lobby and it is SMALL. But, that's like everything in Manhattan.The staff were wonderful. I was able to check in really early (7am) because I had a red-eye flight. I'd say that was luck more than anything, but they were going to try hard to get me a room as early as possible, regardless.I got a room on the quiet side facing a brick wall. I wasn't so fussed about the view. I was more fussed with the fact that my door was right beside an ice machine. (3rd floor in case your curious). I was going to change rooms, but figured I might get a room by the elevator or on the street side. Each floor only has a few rooms with 2 double beds, so the choice isn't plentiful. And herein lies the problem with this place. Even with advance knowledge of a room preference, I'd say your chances are still probably 65% that you'll get noise - and lots of it. The noise is usually a deterrent for me since I am a light sleeper, but in this place it didn't matter. I was so exhausted every night I slept through the freight train known as the ice machine for 3 nights in a row...WiFi was good, but I am guessing that's because I was on a low floor next to the lobby.I'd stay here again in a heartbeat for the location alone.

The hotel is really slim and tall. there only looked to be about 6 bedrooms on each floor so this is not the usual type of place to stay.

Best Western has become my go-to brand - while/ some have been better than others, I've never stayed in a bad one yet. This was one of the best! I knew nothing about NYC or Manhattan geography, but it looked like the hotel was close to the theater district, and it was. An easy 15 minute walk to TImes Square. It was also around the corner from the Empire State Building and Macy's (which was all dressed up for Christmas.) Even better, it was an easy walk from Penn Station, so when I picked my kid up at JFK, we took the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) from Jamaica to Penn Station and were at the hotel in minutes. It was close to the Herald Square subway station, so we were able to take the subway all over. The room was small, but I expected that in NYC. I felt it was a good value for the price, especially when you factor in the hot breakfast. We were in room 204. We had two double beds and we had to dance around each other sometimes in the narrow space between the beds and the desk/TV. It would be pretty tight with three and unwieldy with four unless maybe two are kids. There was a window overlooking the lounge on the ground floor, but we didn't care about a view. We never had problems with noise. There was a staircase we could use instead of the elevator if we wanted. The most amazing thing for me was all the electrical outlets! I have never had such easy access to so many plugs! There was one in the wall by one bed, so a CPAP user like my husband would have had no problem. There were two outlets by each bed on the center console, along with a light switch. There were also outlets on the lamp on the desk. Plenty of space to charge everything without running cables everywhere. There was no bath, but the shower was nice. They included makeup removing towelettes, which was nice and probably saves their linens. The breakfast was on the lower level, along with the fitness room. It was a full, hot breakfast with lots of choices - eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal - and different items each day. The staff was all very nice and helpful. We arrived early Saturday, so they let us check our luggage until 3pm check in time, and again on Monday after checkout until we had to leave for the airport.

This one was ended up with a bad taste that I've to share.Pro: convenient location just a couple blocks away from Macy's and Metro. Almost next to Keen chophouse. Surrounding my a few good food places. Free water and coffee all day, but sometimes you have to wait for them to replenish the hot water. Decent free cold/hot continental breakfast.Con: Lucky that I got a room facing Empire State Building, otherwise it's quite noisy if your room is street facing.The housekeeper was thinking to get into our room around 9am on the 2nd day while I still have the do not disturb sign out. Since we didn't really leave our room till 11ish, so we asked for clean up on the way out. When we were back around 2pm, room wasn't cleaned, so we asked the 2nd time as we planned to stop the room again after shopping for a bit. Room was still not cleaned around 5pm. We almost have to ask twice before room was cleaned for the next couple nights until the last night. Also, the cleaners start making up the room as early as 8am which you would definitely be awaken if you're light sleeper as the sound proof wasn't great, you can hear them banging on the doors and vaccuming.Worst experience was the ride that was arranged by the hotel to Newark airport. I specifically asked how much the ride to the airport is for 3 times and I was told it is $83 cash all inclusive, tips and everything. No need to pay extra. It's already a bit higher than my last year visit for at least $10, but I still thought it's ok as it should be cheaper than cab during rush hour. In the end, the driver asked for $104 and tips before giving us luggages back! He said $83 is just for the ride excluding toll and tips. I refused to give him tips while I told my friend to start grabbing our luggages. The driver gave in taking my $104 and left. I never had any problem with any hotel ride arrangement prior. This left me a really sour taste at the end of the visit. I'll definitely not going back as the price wasn't much cheaper than other hotels. This trial visit totally disappointed me. Fairfield inn and garden inn were a lot better.","Toronto, Canada",9,3.0

So make sure you get a high-floor (above 10) looking South if you want an Empire State view. BUT the rooms are super clean. Very nicely appointed.

So, finding this hotel was a real find for me. My husband and I with our two adult children stayed for a week and found the location, amenities, WiFi, breakfast, and staff top notch. One of our rooms was located facing the street, the other away. If I could make a recommendation regarding a room choice, I would for certain say to choose a room NOT facing the street. I am a light sleeper and would not be able to cope with the street side noise. We found the location to be about a central as it comes - close to everything - subways, Bryant Park, Empire State Building ... all the stuff you want to see and do while visiting NYC. I really appreciated the beverage bar on the main level to grab a coffee, tea, or cold cup of water. My only ""complaint"" -- and it is no reflection on the staff or hotel itself -- would be certain guests. We were awoken on one evening of our stay at 3:10 a.m. by a group of female guests on our floor that were no less than shrieking. They proceeded to carry on with their noise only a couple of doors away for over an hour. I'm sure our whole floor was aware of this. As with all hotels, I find these types of guests not uncommon -- no matter what class of hotel you are staying in. Additionally, not to address this hotel in particular but why do all hotel doors have the slam shut feature? This is highly annoying for those that like to sleep past the early early hours - or when you're trying to drop off to sleep.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a centrally located, exceptionally clean, and well priced hotel in NYC.

I had to be at an event at The Times Center on 41st Street in New York, but did not want to be too close to the Times Square, though I wanted to be close enough. I arrived around 10:30 in the morning, and within 20 minutes they were able to get me into a room.For New York, the room was more spacious than I expected, it also had a view of the Empire State Building. The bathroom was spacious too. Both the room and the bathroom were immaculately clean. The Wi-Fi worked exceptionally well.I cannot praise enough the responsiveness of the people working at this hotel, particularly Ryan, Bebe, Andre, and Jay. I had to deal with a variety of situations, some somewhat unusual, and all of them were tremendously helpful, and were total stars at that.The lobby is not big, but it has a nice sense of design. Most importantly, it has a station where water, coffee (freshly made all day long), and tea are available throughout the day. There is a lovely bar area in the back with a charming back patio, which is a mini hideaway oasis from New York's hustle and bustle. As a bonus, there is also a lovely patio out front with comfortable seating, it was handy on so many occasions, and it made me reflect on how few hotels actually have this great feature.The breakfast area was spacious, but I would recommend going a bit early, as it can get very crowded during peak times. Their breakfast was of great quality with a tremendous variety of offerings, which were constantly replenished.The location of this hotel speaks for itself - it is close to so many famous sights in New York from Herald Square to Times Square, to Madison Square Garden, to Empire State Building, to Penn Station, and the list goes on. There are also many great restaurants in the vicinity. The Keg Room across from the hotel is nice for casual dining and they had great service, while Brendan's on 35th Street was a lovely more upscale dining discovery.I was glad I stayed at Best Western Premier Herald Square, and would not hesitate staying there again, so it's highly recommended.","Los Angeles, California",202,5.0

Each floor seemed to consist of six rooms, resulting in no noise from neighbours. Perhaps we were lucky but we stayed for a week so I suspect this is the norm.

Air Conditioning was brilliant. An essential as it was extremely hot and humid outside. Our room was ready for us when we arrived two hours before check in time and we were able to leave our cases in a case deposit room on the day we checked out so that we could collect them later. Breakfast was included in our room rate. Excellent coffee and orange juice. These were the highlights as some items were not really up to standard e.g. horrible boiled eggs. Everything was obviously brought in and was served on plastic plates with plastic cutlery. It could easily be improved by adding slices of bread, cheese, ham etc. It would also help if things were labelled e.g. I nearly missed the vegetarian sausage one day and I am vegetarian.Despite my breakfast comments I would recommend this hotel and would certainly book it again on a future trip.",West Bromwich,32,5.0

They say the breakfast finishes at half past 9 and so the times between half 8 and half 9, it gets very busy in that small breakfast room! You might even need to stand around waiting for a table. However, we'd always go down at around half 9ish, when things were dying down and so we'd always find a seat. For breakfast, you'll find a small selection of cereals, doughnuts, breads, bagels and cakes. In the hot breakfast, you'll did eggs (different each day), pancakes, bacon, sausage, hash browns and oatmeal. These are normally on a rotation so breakfast differs each day!There is also a lovely gym.

It was conveniently located less than 2 blocks from the subway on a quiet side street. It was in a nice midway point between the sites downtown (like 9/11 Museum & State of LIberty) and the sites uptown (like Central Park and the museums). The room was very cramped by our suburban standards, but we knew rooms in Manhattan wouldn't be spacious. We had a great view of the Empire State Building out our window which was a neat plus. Being on the back of the building, we heard no traffic noise at night. While we were there during an extremely hot and humid spell, we did notice that our room's climate control had a difficult time maintaining a consistent temperature. The room was clean. The shower was huge! The breakfast choices changed somewhat each day and were kept well stocked right up to the end of the breakfast time. The breakfast room itself though was a nightmare! Cramped would be an understatement for the space. The furniture was much too big for the tiny space which made it nearly impossible to walk through the room when it was full. There was an option to get a to go box and take your breakfast to your room, but, as there was no space to sit up there except on our beds, we opted to wait for a table most mornings. As first time visitors to the city, I was hoping for a little more ""concierge type"" help from the employees at the front desk, but, while they were polite, they weren't as helpful as I had hoped. It was nice to always have cold water available in the lobby but we had difficulty finding ice at first as there isn't an icemachine on most of the floors and there was no hotel directory in our room.

My husband and I had spent a great deal of time researching hotel after hotel in New York and we settled on this one because of its central location and that it wasn’t a huge hotel.The hotel itself is on West 36th Street and 100 yards to the end of the street you’re straight onto 6th Ave and Broadway. It’s mid-town so perfect for getting around all of New York. There is also the Herald Square underground station at the end of the street which we found to be great for getting around on. It’s quite a central station for the tube with access to most places.We decided to take the train from JFK to Penn Station and this was less than 10 minutes’ walk from the hotel (and that was in bustling streets with luggage). Would recommend that, must better than sitting in a cab from the airport.On arrival the reception staff were great, checked us in swiftly and we were placed on the 13th floor facing the back of the hotel. This was perfect, nice and high so there wasn’t too much street noise and had a great view of the Empire State Building, two streets away on 34th Street. The windows are very good at sound proofing.The room was great for a city break. We stayed for seven nights and it was more than adequate – there had been some reviews which we’d read to say that this hotel had quite small rooms. Now, it wasn’t massive and we had to be choosey about what we hung up and what we put in drawers but found enough nooks and crannies for things like shoes and suitcases. The bathroom had a large shower and a long mirror so getting ready was easy.The room was clean and tidy, it looked recently decorated. It’s also very modern and our floor (I think they are all the same) only had five/six rooms on it so there wasn’t much noise from the corridors. As we were there for a week we did have a Friday and Saturday night there – they were the noisiest nights in terms of guests coming back to their rooms but that isn’t the hotels fault at all.This hotel was one of the only ones which we looked at that included breakfast. If I’m honest, we weren’t expecting much – maybe some coffee and muffins and had planned that we eat out every morning for breakfast. We didn’t do that once. The breakfast was more than adequate. We ate bagels, cereal, croissants, bacon, eggs, waffles, pancakes and fruit. Each morning there are three hot options which varied day to day. There was a plentiful choice of bagels and brioche – we were full to bursting every morning! The only downside is that the breakfast room isn’t very big. When we started our holiday we were quite jetlagged and went down for breakfast at around 6.30-7am and there was plenty of tables. But, as the week crept on and we woke slightly later as we got in to the swing of the time difference the room was gradually busier each morning. On our last day we went down at around 8.45am and we ended up having to take our breakfast back to our room. Get down early to avoid the rush and get a table – there was plenty of food though, everything was replenished quick.There is a bar at the back of the hotel which was a nice touch after a long day sightseeing.The beds were really comfy and there were some toiletries and face cloths in the bathroom as well as plenty of fluffy towels.Would highly recommend this hotel – very good location, very good value for money and an excellent night’s sleep in the big apple!","Chorley, United Kingdom",26,5.0

This hotel is either new appears to have been renovated recently and we were pleasantly surprised that it was very clean and tidy. The rooms were as usual small even though it was meant for 4 adults with two double beds but not different from some of the other places in the neighbourhood esp. for sub-$300 per night room. The night we arrived from DC, 36th street was closed to traffic for some unknown reason but the hotel staff were very kind and met us on 5th avenue and I managed to reverse our car opposite the hotel to allow my dad who has limited mobility to get off closer to the hotel as well as unload all our bags (since my son was vacating his dorm in Philly after graduation) and we were flying back to London with 2 pieces of luggage each! The hotel management very kindly accommodated all our big bags in the luggage room as we didn't require them and they gave us a nice room close to the lift so that we could park my dad's wheelchair outside and not clutter up the room further. The rooms had floor to ceiling windows and plenty of light, although there wasn't anything exciting to see in the street below. The hotel manager and all staff looked after my dad's needs very well including dressing up a wound he sustained in the room because he tripped in the room. The two men who handled our luggage and the hotel manager and all other staff were very friendly and actually went out of the way to help my father one evening when we had to leave him to go visit friends for dinner. They assisted in getting some packed dinner from a neighbouring restaurant and ensuring that it was received in the room etc. The hotel is so close to Empire State Building, Times Square and the world's largest Macy's and of course walkable (or subway) distance to all other attractions in NYC. In fact, the subway station is literally around the block on 6th Avenue/Avenue of Americas. Penn and Grand Central Stations are pretty close too and it very easy to find a door-to-door limo service to/from JFK There are plenty of breakfast and other food places nearby too. All in all, I think this is a great hotel and better than some of the grotty places I have stayed in near 42nd street. Will most certainly stay here again.","London, United Kingdom",75,5.0

Therefore when I was looking for a hotel in NYC after being there two different times and being unhappy with the hotels I was extremely impressed with this best Western. When you first walk in there is a very nice lobby and everybody who worked at the front desk was very nice. There is chilled water with fruit thats complementary along with coffee right there. We stayed in room 1601 July 4-7 which was an executive room. Yes the rooms are small but if you have ever been to NYC it doesn't matter where you stay, the rooms and bathrooms are always smaller. The room was very clean and more than enough space for my husband and I. The floor to ceiling windows were absolutely wonderful and really loved our view. Yes the bathroom is small and I guess the only thing I did not like was the rainfall shower, but it was nice. We would leave every day and return to our room perfectly cleaned and the bed made.The breakfast was good assortment and considering it is complementary I would recommend and we ate there on two different mornings of our stay. Right across the street there's a restaurant and bar called the Keg which offered very good assortment of food and assortment of beers. Not to mention ever easily across the street. There was a 24 hour restaurant at the end of the block, Keen steakhouse and a market and deli just around the corner. Great location because the Empire State is just a block behind the hotel, Bryant Park is only a few blocks away.I have to recognize Sade, Bebe and Andre. They were extremely helpful and very friendly. On the morning of our leave we decided on last minute shopping we wanted to do and they took care of our bags for us while we went and did that before leaving the hotel.

We tried going around the block but side streets were blocked in both directions. We called the hotel in desperation for help. The desk attendant, realizing that there were no alternative routes, asked for a description of our car and told us she would meet us at the end of the street. She did. In what must have been a somewhat heated exchange with the police officer, she got him to lift the barricade and let us through. She then took our luggage while we proceeded to the parking garage next door. Talk about going ""above and beyond the call of duty"". This young lady did just that and we want to publicly commend her with the highest praise possible. After this very difficult start, our stay at the Best Western Premier was outstanding in every way.

Our final night was spoiled as the smoke alarm went off in our room while we were sleeping around 2:00 am. I was very disappointed in how the staff reacted to our clear imposition. Had thought that a gift card or some sort of incentive should have been offered as we had to wait for the technician to come shut of the alarm.

The two king size beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was modern and clean. Special mention for the lovely room maids - no matter if we left the room at 7am in the morning or at midday, it was always cleaned when we came back.Breakfast wasn't amazing but enough to keep you full until late lunch. I was pleasantly surprised by the irange juice which wasn't just some sugary liquid but actual tasty, fruity orange juice. Not completelyy sure about spring roles for breakfast (just on one day) but that's just my personal taste. In general the mix of 3 warm dishes (scrambled eggs, omlettes, sausages, pancakes etc - the choices varied from day to day) and the usual baguels, toast, yoghurt, cereals, pastries and such was fine. The breakfast room itself was rather small but we always had breakfast quite early so never had a problem getting a table. As always in US hotels I didn't approve of the plastic plates and cuttlery. Way too much waste. The hotel is on 36th street so in walking distance of Broadway. Our main reason for being in NYC was Punchdrunk's Sleep no more on 27th Street which was easy to reach by subway or cab when we didn't feel like walking (20 mins walk).Plus Macy's and 5th Avenue are just around the corner so the hotel is great for both theatre and shopping.

It's difficult to find a good hotel in a safe neighborhood, steps away from a subway stop that serves several lines, that offers included WiFi and breakfast AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICEl. This hotel fulfilled all my requirements and added a clean, stylish room with a roomy bathroom and a superb staff. I enjoyed my stay VERY much. The breakfast was certainly adequate, especially for a gluten intolerant person like me. Plenty of fresh fruit and yogurt for me to enjoy. The WiFi worked very well with my Kindle Fire. All the people who took care of me, from the front desk to housekeeping to the people in the breakfast room were wonderful. When I needed a later check-out time, my request was cheerfully granted. I was always greeted when entering and leaving the hotel. Of course the location is fabulous and I was able to either walk to where I wanted to go or grab a train at the 34th Street station.

However, the location was perfect otherwise as well. We traveled into Port Authority by bus, and found it a pleasant and easy walk from there, as well as to the rehearsal dinner on 33rd St. Several others from the family were staying there as well, and the small patio area in front of the hotel was a great meeting and congregating place, although the music playing was a little annoying, and made conversation a little difficult at times. The bar was nice, and the patio by the bar was more pleasant. The staff was very friendly and helpful, handling a request to leave something for my daughter to pick up at the front desk efficiently and cheerfully, and holding our luggage for us after we checked out until we were ready to leave later in the afternoon. And when I carelessly left things in the safe after we had checked out, they quickly sent Ryan back up to the room with me to retrieve them. Ryan was everywhere, handling luggage, keeping the patio area clean and tidy, stocking the coffee area and cleaning it up, and always with a smile!

I would agree with another reviewer that the placement of controls in the shower make it difficult to regulate the water temperature before you get in the shower. My only complaint would be that housekeeping never serviced our room.

The (2 doubles) bedrooms are teensy, but once we unpacked and stowed our bags, they proved satisfactory. (Would be nice to have room for a 2nd chair, tho!) The beds were great, the room was surprisingly quiet, and the amenities top quality.The bath was disproportionately large with towels stowed under the sink (Mom couldn't figure our where they were initially), and really AWFUL lighting. Impossible for putting on makeup; why do hotels DO that?The location was fabulous and SO convenient to subways, cabs, walking to eateries, etc. The little breakfast room was frequently jammed, requiring the tiny bar upstairs to be pressed into service for additional seating (holds about 8 people). However, the quality and variety of breakfast selections was better than expected, and well-presented.The front desk staff were amazingly helpful and courteous, both during and after our stay. Mom left a couple of items in the armoire, and discovered this while we were on the train to New Orleans. I called the hotel and spoke with the housekeeping staff who instructed me on how to have them sent to Mom's home by UPS (at our cost, of course).

The bar is small, it only serves paninis though. The only real downside to the hotel is that the elevators/lifts get congested at peak times. Recommendations for food, The Keg Room across the street is very good (Approx $80 for meal for three adults), there is a lovely restaurant called Brendan's on 35th St. The hotel is very close to Macys, Fifth Ave (St Patrick's Day Parade), and really central overally.For LGBT travellers I'd recommend XES lounge on 24th St which is 20mins walk from the hotel.

The location was perfect for us, but I would not stay here again unless we find another deeply discounted rate.There was a minor problem with our reservation, which took entirely too long to resolve because the desk clerk's goal was to make sure she didn't get into trouble with her boss for the way she handled the problem. The room was barely bigger than the two double beds, but this is NYC, so that wasn't a surprise. The barkeep in the lobby lounge was pleasant and drinks were reasonably priced. There were three things that seriously impacted our stay and that would prevent me from returning here:1. the bed - instead of putting enough blankets on the bed, it was decorated with one of those idiotic ""bed scarves"" which may look stylish but serve no useful purpose. The temperature in the room dropped overnight and several times I woke up cold. At 3 a.m. do you really want to have to call the front desk for another blanket?2. at 8 a.m. on Saturday morning the housekeepers began banging on the doors on our floor asking if the guests were leaving and if they could clean the rooms. IT WAS SATURDAY MORNING AND WE WANTED TO SLEEP IN, NOT LISTEN TO HOUSEKEEPING'S NOISE. That cost me 2 hours of sleep, and I find it totally unacceptable that the housekeeping staff can not do their job without disturbing every guest on the floor. They stood out in the hall (which was as tiny as the rooms) and talked loudly when they weren't making banging and clashing around noises. Rude, unprofessional and inappropriate.3. the bathrooms: why have so many hotels gone to the high fashion but useless style of bathroom? Here's what I wrote to the hotel about their trendy new bathrooms:The bathroom (room 704) was horrible. It has one of those trendy new looks that makes for a horrible user experience. For example, why is the only towel rack INSIDE THE SHOWER? There is no place to set down one's toiletry kit - the narrow ledge around the sink is too narrow and/or wet. No place to set one's clothes while one is in the shower, except the toilet lid, which is slanted so that the clothes slide off onto the floor. The glass door of the shower opens outward, and when you open it, the water all runs off of it, onto the bathmat and the floor - which means that the floor is now all wet, and so are your feet, which makes putting on your clothes, especially your socks, a problem. If you really must put in glass doors, MAKE THEM SLIDING DOORS. Also, with the current design of the doors, you can not stand outside the shower and adjust the water temperature before you get into the shower, so you either freeze or get scalded until you can reach the knob and figure out how it's supposed to work. The shower control knob has no visible markings, so you have to guess where to set it to get the right temperature. The shower head is so high that the average women (5'4"" is the U.S. average) can barely reach it to adjust the direction or spray. How about going to the European style of shower hear, the one that slides up and down on a rod, so that any size person can have a comfortable shower. Also the brand of soap in the shower does not rinse off well with the softened water - think about choosing toiletries that are compatible with the local water!Finally, the towels in our room (cleverly hidden under the sink, not anywhere convenient for the user) were so rough and worn that I'd give them to local animal shelter, not to a paying guest.Bathroom: looks 10, functionality 2.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",72,3.0

We have used the Best Western chain numerous times in the past but this was our first experience staying at their 'flagship' Premier hotels. To say we were less than impressed is an understatement.Never having stayed in New York before I was not surprised that our room was small, real estate is expensive. That said our room did not even have a proper closet just a small wardrobe tucked in the corner. None of the amenities we have come to expect were present including a microwave, refrigerator or even a bar fridge. The room was nice enough, if a little garishly decorated, but so tiny that our night stands were shelves bolted to the wall.Breakfast was included with our stay which was nice but it is served in the basement adjacent to housekeeping and the gym. Hardly an appealing place to eat and we were served on plastic plates with accompanying plastic cutlery.There are definitely some good things about this hotel.

I got a 15th floor room facing north. The window wall slants in -- a cool design feature on the upper floors. The room was clean. the view was spectacular. The LEED Platinum Bank of America building spire is the focal point. I liked the funky wall art. Everything worked. I have two complaints -- there was a weird elevator machinery clicking noise AND like many other hotels with limited bathroom shelf space, they put the bath towels beneath the sink and while they put them as far from the toilet as possible, in my mind, still too close...

In addition, the lounge downstairs has a killer barista who mixed me one of the best drinks I've ever had. Are the rooms small? Yes. But you are in New York city! Every single space is small. I think we were the loud room on the floor, because we didn't hear a single noise the entire time we were there. Our room faced the courtyard and we had a blast window-watching the offices across (I understand the ugly naked guy thing in Friends now!). My husband and I are spoiled brats and like new or recently updated hotels, which was perfect because this one was new. It well off-set the smallness of the room.

My bf and I are big-time walkers, but I would still consider this easily 'walking distance' to most of the major NY museums by normal human standards. The front desk staff were all friendly and helpful.The room was nice and modern and the bed was suuuper comfy. We stayed in room 1305 and were told we'd have a view of the Empire State Building but it was definitely just a view of the cute, old apartment building across the street. It would have been nice to see the skyline, but we were in the room furthest from the elevator and, considering that there's absolutely NO soundproofing between rooms and the hall, (seriously almost half an inch of light shining under the door that I had to stop up with a towel) I suspect that I would have slept much worse in the other rooms. We could hear every voice in the hall all night and of course guests will be coming and going at all hours by Times Square. We heard every door handle turn, every door slam, the ice machine, the elevator chirps, everything. I don't know that I've ever had a more frequently interrupted sleep and this was a mid-week after the holidays were finished.I'm also amazed by how much light was in the room. The tv glowed in two places and had to be covered up, the smoke detector had a bright green LED light, the light under the door, the thermostat if in use and even the window. I can't understand why BW would use blackout curtains cut to fit within the window, it just means that you have a rectangle of light shining all around the edge.The free breakfast cafe used entirely disposable dishes and utensils, not even reusable coffee mugs which seemed like incredibly, incredibly excessive waste. It was also pretty much all pastries and baked goods so if you can't eat grains, you won't really be getting a free breakfast. The 'hot' foods were microwaved bacon, sausage and pre-cooked microwave omelets (ugh, the texture was unforgettable). It seemed like all of their hots were just microwaved foods. This was also the only restaurant I saw in New York that had a 'B' rating from the health inspector. We tried to eat reasonably well, but both had mild stomach aches from the breakfasts.All in all, you'll get a GREAT location for an average New York price and I'd highly recommend ear plugs, a sleeping mask and breakfast elsewhere if you feel like this is still the hotel for you.","Vancouver, B.C.",7,3.0

Based on those good experiences, we decided to try this Best Western Premier but our expectations were not met. But the hotel is in a good location for tourists, has comfortable beds, and offers an ample breakfast--this will be enough for many people.When staying at hotels we always request a high floor and a room away from the elevator and ice/soda machines. At this hotel we did get the 17th floor, but the layout of each floor meant that all rooms were pretty close to the elevator--and ours was diagonally across from it. Still, it might have been OK except for the frequent sounds that seemed to come from the elevator even when it wasn't stopping at our floor. At first it sounded like someone coughing outside our room, but later we realized the sound was mechanical, and the repetition of the sound drove me a bit crazy--but I may be more sensitive to noise than other people. Other noise issues were due to other guests loudly slamming doors (or more accurately, letting the door slam instead of holding it so it closes more quietly) and hearing the neighbors talking and laughing in the room (an indication of thin walls or poor soundproofing). Wearing earplugs at night did help some, but we did not sleep well. The other problem affecting sleep was a heating system that alternated between chilly and too hot when set at what for us is usually a comfortable temperature; we asked the hotel to check this on the second day and they did try to fix it, but it still was not consistently comfortable at night. Another maintenance issue had to do with the shades for the floor-to-ceiling windows. When we checked in we could not pull one of the shades all the way down, and we called the desk to request that they fix it or move us to another room. They sent someone up but he was not able to fix it completely, though he was able to pull it down enough that it kept most of the light out of the room. We agreed to stay in the room if they could fix it completely the next day while we were out. When we came back to the room in the afternoon, the shade was fixed but there was a much bigger problem--there were bits of dust or dirt all over the bed, apparently from where they put the shade while they were working on it. Also, although the bed was made up, the rest of the room had not been cleaned--dirty towels still on the floor, wastebaskets full, etc. Since I saw the housekeeper down the hall and thought she had just forgotten to finish the room due to the shade repair going on, I brought her the dirty towels and the wastebaskets and requested that she give me new towels. She did so, but she never came in to finish cleaning the room. I reported these issues to the front desk and was told that the rooms are serviced around 2:30-3 (we had come back a little earlier than that) and that they would ask housekeeping to do it when we went back out. We did go back out soon after, but when we came back the bathroom surfaces obviously still had not been cleaned. Add that to the fact that when we checked in there was toilet paper in the toilet (not dirty, but still disconcerting), and I was very disappointed in the housekeeping at this hotel. Perhaps it was partly due to misunderstanding and poor timing, but I expect better at a Best Western Premier.","Rockville, MD",161,3.0

There is a room safe which will hold iPads etc. Breakfast is included and you shouldn't be disappointed. Hot food changes daily but even for a non meat eater still found something. For a Brit we missed baked beans not being an option lol. Daily choice of cereals,porridge,pastries,cakes, bagels, toast,yogurts,fruit and then varying hot options eg waffles, pancakes,omelettes,bacon,scrambled egg etc. Nice to find decent orange juice. Plastic plates & cutlery odd but not a problem. The breakfast staff (Erica) are great. Really friendly. We never had a problem getting a table either. Reception guy Andre is a jolly giant. Really helpful and fun. Lou and Edwin great guys too. Hotels location is fab, and FREE Wi-Fi. We had a great time and if we came back to NY would def try to stay at this hotel again. Maceys a couple of blocks one direction, Empire State the other way, and a McDonald's, papa johns and small grocery store round the corner. Times Square bout 5-10mins walk. NY public library nearby too. Would recommend getting a Big Bus pass. We had 2day deluxe which does uptown, downtown, Brooklyn, night tour and includes a cruise past Staue of Liberty & the Islands and bridges. Reception sell these tickets. If you don't have a planned itinerary ride the bus and see the sights and work out where you want to go/get off the next day. The Brooklyn tour goes from near where you catch the ferry for Lib Island and 9/11 is also down this end of town so plan your day! Starbucks are everywhere, but we struggled to find a diner/restaurant with vegetables on the menu Applebys near Times Square/Broadway does veg and reasonable prices too. Beware the American tax system. The price you see is + 9%Tax and tips extra. Oh, and if you want a great American cheesecake, find Juniors! If you visit Grand Central go downstairs to the food court area, so much choice, lots of seats and noise. You can people watch and really take in the non sleeping city comings and goings.

I can honestly say that I was very impressed by the experience here. I believe the room rates are very fair. I know some other past travelers may say that the rooms are small and may be the case but I had a sufficient size room for 2 people and a king size bed with nice view of the Empire State building from 16th floor. So the rooms are still going to be bigger than you would find in a European setting. There is a cozy little bar in the rear and I was given a free arrival drink coupon and if you have to pay, the happy hour prices are very reasonable. Rooms are nice, bed is comfortable and very nice bathroom amenities are provided. Breakfast is downstairs one level and can get crowded and put pressure on seating availability and all the food choices but I suggest go late or early to breakfast but not at prime time. There is cereal, fruit, bacon, eggs(small patties), breads/pastries, and coffee(very good), juices, etc. The location is right on, walking to many local attractions and the subway is a 5 minute walk. So everything is spot on here at this hotel and I wish to point out that the staff are very friendly and helpful.

ALL of the staff we met were extremely helpful and friendly. Lou, the concierge, has great tips for sightseeing. The breakfast choices were great - hot eggs, bacon/sausage, hot oatmeal, cereal, pastries, fruit, coffee, tea, juices, milk, etc. We spent 4 days during the week - well stocked each and every day we were there - and we went at varying times each morning. Breakfast room in on the floor below the lobby. Rooms are small (but you're in NYC and this is normal for this price range) but very clean and well-kept/decorated (FYI: no tub, just shower but it's large and very nice/clean). We were on the 8th floor and there is some outside noise, but, again, you're in NYC - the city that never sleeps! If you must have complete silence to sleep, there is a CVS a couple of blocks up (5th & 38th) and they sell earplugs! We arrived early to check-in and they will hold your baggage for you until your room is ready. Also, check-out time is 11 am, and if your train/flight is leaving later (ours left at 3 pm), they will hold your baggage for you as well, free of charge (tips are appreciated). We returned at 230 to pick up our bags which were promptly retrieved. Location is great - VERY close to the Empire State Building, Macy's, and subway stops - the front desk will help with subway questions and give you a map. There is free cold water, tea and coffee available in the lobby all day. This was the first time I took my children into the city (10 and 14 years old), and we felt very comfortable and safe at this hotel. They enjoyed it as much as I did.

For the location - you can walk to Times Square, Bryant Park, Empire State Building, Penn Station and Madison Square Garden - the price is very reasonable. The hotel is small, like many in the area, with just six rooms per floor and about 17 floors. thus, the rooms are quite small. But you'll be greeted with a nice clean smell, a modern look and all the amenities. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful, especially Laura J. And the lobby always had fresh coffee and ice water available. Go ahead and take advantage of the free breakfast, since you'll drop quite a few coins eating dinner out on the town.

From my first phone inquiry regarding rooms and availability, to being politely greeted at our arrival and check-in, and culminating in a delightful yet all to brief stay, the staff was always personable, attentive, considerate, and mindful of their guests.  The rooms' green/purplish décor may be somewhat modernistic but I think it fits well given the hotels short 2yr existence...defiantly not boring and dated. There is no denying that the room size may suffer from some economy of scale, but they are all clean, comfortable, stocked with amenities, and very inviting. Those same words also apply to the bathroom, but I must also note that I truly adored the adjustable shower...could only wish to have one in my home.  This hotel offered all of the associated comforts and benefits of many of the large upper class chains, but seemed to provide them in a more homey manner. They offer a concierge service, weight room, complimentary refreshments, and quaint in-house bar, unfortunately it is only open until 11pm. In trying to find a more family friendly hotel another truly appreciative nicety provided with our stay was the free and quite delectable breakfast buffet, which only saved $$ and time in planning our days' NYC activities.  I could probably continue with a few more paragraphs given my delight of this hotel(having not even touched on its central location & convenience), however doing so would only make my previous words seem redundant. In truth I second guessed even leaving this glowing recommendation for fear that this little gem in the city might be consumed by the masses, leaving me with some concern should I find my way back to NYC.Great Stay,K.

Basically, the employees catered to our every need - even the ones we didn't know we had. The Penn station stop was only a few blocks away, which made it easy to use public transit to get around. They are also walking distance to Bryant Park, which is great, and Times Square. The one caveat is that the rooms are small. It was a bit crowded with three of us in the room. For the low price we paid though, it was more than adequate and clean as a whistle. New favorite NYC hotel! ","Washington, District of Columbia, United States",8,5.0

Rooms are clean, well decorated, comfortable and cozy (even tho a bit too small...we didn't have much storage and we didn't have a freezer). Breakfasts - in which you get many good choices - are included so it makes the experience very convenient. The location is also very convenient since you are pretty much close to everything and at two steps away from 5th avenue. The most memorable thing to us was however how professional and cool the staff was: We actually had a misadventure which started by a police agent who unfairly gave us a parking ticket, cause we were apparently not supposed to be parked in front of the hotel during the few minutes of our check in. The front desk staff witnessed it and one of the lady wrote us a letter for us to contest our ticket, telling that it was an unjustified one. It was so nice from her and it happened to be so helpful since we went to the office of New York - where we can contest tickets - and we were proclaimed NOT GUILTY!

The hotel is clean, beds are very comfortable and location is excellent. Most of the rooms are doubles and quite small but you have everything you need and Internet connectivity was great. There was noise from construction but only during weekdays. We were up early and out the door by 10:00 so it was no problem for us. When you're in NYC, who wants to stay in bed sleeping! If that's what you want, you're in the wrong town. Other than the construction, our room very quiet after hours. We were on the 14 floor facing the street. If you're looking for extra quite, go high. You can't determine which room you'll get until after you check in. Ask to see the room before settling in. You can always change if they have availability.One thing I like about Best Western hotels is the complimentary breakfast. That helps a lot when you're on the go. They have plenty to offer for everyone: fruit, cereal, yogurt, fresh pastries and at least one egg and sausage dish + pancakes, waffles or french toast. The hot food is not of the highest quality but that's to be expected in a chain hotel. I skipped the meat dishes as there were plenty of other options.Service was excellent. They even stored our bags when we checked out so we could do more sightseeing. It was very well organized - the bags were ticketed so there were no mix-ups. We enjoyed the cute bar with patio. It was a nice escape for a drink and the bartender was very helpful. Herald Square is a convenient location for visiting all the main sights in NYC: Empire State Building, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc. Plus, you're in the garment district so there are plenty of discount shopping opportunities if you have time for that. On the downside, Hearld Square is the heart of Manhattan so it's noisy, super crowded and dirty. However, it is a good place to get an overview of NYC if you've never been there. Next time, we'll pick a neighborhood like, Chelsea or Greenwich. Here are some helpful tips based on our experience:Brooklyn Bridge and Brooklyn Heights:We took the subway to Brooklyn and walked down to the new Brooklyn waterfront park which is lovely. However, it would be much more convenient to take the water taxi from Manhattan. The water taxi takes you right there. With the subway, we got off too far and ended up walking through the projects which is not the best experience when you're unsure of where you are.From the waterfront park, you can walk up to Brooklyn Heights which is where I lived as a child. There are beautiful brownstones, and an amazing view from the renowned Brooklyn Promenade. The neighborhood has become very trendy and it was a surprise to see so many tourists wandering around. To get back to Manhattan, we rented CitiBikes and biked across the Brooklyn bridge which is the best way to go because of the city view. We went on a Sunday which was crazy because it was so crowded. Again, go midweek to avoid the crowds or go really early. Sunset might be better for beautiful photos.Beware when you use CitiBike. The pay stations are awkward and had technical issues. We walked to three different stations before we found one that worked and had enough bikes. Furthermore, you have to return your bike and get a new code every 1/2 hour or they charge you an additional $10 + tax. How inconvenient is that? We got overcharged and it's impossible to get a refund. If you must rent bikes for a couple of hours, skip CitiBike and rent a bike from a real bike shop. Their bikes are better maintained and they have helmets. They're more reasonably priced for longer rides, and you don't have to swipe your credit card every 1/2 hour.911 Memorial & Museum:Here's what most people don't know: You don't have to buy a ticket to see the memorial park. This is not mentioned on the memorial's website. To the see the memorial, just follow the crowds of people and you're there. There is no line to wait in. If you want to see the museum, however, buy your ticket in advance to save time and be prepared to go through a security screening. If you have a big bag, you'll have to check it so travel light.Empire State Building:Go midweek and buy your ticket in advance! Or, go later in the day for sunset pictures. If you go on the weekend, go really early as it's very crowded (as is everything in NYC on the weekend). Don't buy your ticket from the street vendors. You'll end up paying more and there's not that much benefit from it.NYC Pizza:Want to try some great NYC pizza? Go to Greenwich Village! I highly recommend Joe's for a slice. This place is renowned for it's pizza. It'll be hard to go back to regular pizza after a slice of Joe's.Hot Dogs:Unfortunately, authentic NYC hotdogs, I'm told, are no longer readily available in NYC. Instead, every corner has a ""Halal"" hot dog stand that sells falafals, gyros and hot dogs. And, they don't come close to what NYC hot dogs used to be. What a shame. If anyone knows of an authentic hot dog stand in NYC, please email me! My advice is to skip these overpriced stands (they all charge different price according to their mood). If you must buy a dog at one of these places, don't pay more than $2 as that is the going rate. Make sure they post their prices. If not, move on.","Seattle, Washington",6,4.0

Housekeeping was extremely noisy in the mornings, ignored our ""Do Not Disturb"" sign THREE times and woke us and put the wrong size sheets on our bed. Yes, the location is great but there are many other hotels next door and nearby. We would not recommend this one.Pros: The front end staff was very friendly and helpful, the room was beautifully decorated and sound proof from the busyness outside and the cleanliness was what we've come to appreciate from Best Westerns Cons: The noise and disturbance from housekeeping ruined our stay here (listed below). The breakfast (especially the eggs) is not good and the guest room doors need buffering as they are the loudest we've ever experienced. When we presented our experiences to the hotel staff they apologized but brushed us off very quickly. We then completely a Best Western survey and detailed our thoughts and received nothing more than a form letter not addressing any of our concerns. Disappointing!!!!Here is our account:""Quiet Please"" sign on door - 8:00am housekeeping cleaning room next door and singing at top of her lungs for over a half hour.""Quiet Please"" sign on door - 9:00am Knock at door announcing ""Housekeeping"". They must have realized their mistake because they left before we got to the door but by then we were already woken up.One day we returned to hotel at 5:00pm to rest before going out again- the room was being serviced by housekeeping so we had to wait in lobby for 15 minutes. We mention this only because of the inconsistency in the times they serviced the rooms, leaving us no way to predict when they'd be there which made it more difficult to plan our day.""Quiet Please"" sign on door - A knock at the door, we answered and housekeeping had brought us fresh towels as they had forgotten to leave some earlier.We went to bed on our fourth night and couldn't sleep due to the sheets bunching/shifting. At approx. 12:30am when we turned on the lights and took a better look we discovered that the sheets didn't fit the bed at all. It became evident that they were Queen size and we were in a King size bed. We requested the proper sized sheets from the front desk. Instead we were brought new blankets. This was soon corrected but the whole thing prevented us from sleeping by a good hour.We were so disappointed in this hotel and even more disappointed by the way the staff and Best Western itself have dealt with our feedback.","Vancouver, Canada",7,2.0

Breakfast is good, varies quite often in the items offered, so even a longer stay does not get too boring the staff here is very friendly. This however does not apply to all the male front desk personal. Strangely enough only the males there were quite snappy when confronted with minor request or problems. We had to ask 3 times for an additional blanket, which got forgotten the first evening and was finally delivered the next day...after asking one of the female front desk staff...;-). Despite being a registered, frequent customer to BW were not able to get a late checkout.Room service appears to be generally slow and sloppy, one day our room was ""forgotten"" entirely...again at least 2 times asking the guy at the front desk to fix it. Two things I like to mention as well although the hotel or the staff can not really do anything about it: While we were staying we had two construction sites around the hotel with cement-pumps starting as early as 5am and garbage trucks loading construction site trash as late as 10pmThe windows appear not to be able to shield you from any noise coming from the street so it can be a quite noisy night. We had one very rainy day were our window was leaking water, that at least got fixed instantly.

It was a WONDERFUL experience! The hotel has a boutique hotel feel and is new, clean and fresh. A full breakfast is offered each day and the hotel staff is AMAZING!! Lou was particularly friendly and helpful each day of our stay giving us ideas of places to go and ways to save money. We stayed for five nights and were served a hot full breakfast each day. The staff would always wish us a good day as we left in the morning for our adventures, and welcomed us back each evening. The hotel is in the most ideal area of town. We walked everywhere the five days we were there - even to Central Park! We never hailed a cab the entire time. On the morning we left, I forgot a few items in the lobby that we had purchased. When I called, Zuleika told me how to send a shipping label and they would return the items UPS. Sade packed them up nicely for us and made sure they were delivered. The only negative (if you can even call it that since it is New York City) is that the room was small.

The recognition of Diamond status was excellent and the early check in and late check out were greatly appreciated. The rooms are nice and well decorated. The hotel is recently constructed and still feels new. The bathroom is the by far the best of all of my visits to NYC. The rooms are NYC size, though still felt okay. In hindsight i would have preferred a higher floor, to achieve a small view and to escape construction noise from next door. The negative aspects of the the stay included the terribly mouldy/musty smell from the basement level that was often in the elevators and the terrible linens on the beds. The fitted sheets do not fit the king sized beds and the flat sheets also seem to be the wrong size. this should be addressed immediately.

We stayed from March 9 to 14, 2014 (March Break for our kids). The positives, it was within walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, The New York State Public Library, The Museum of Modern Art, Grand Central Station, etc. The breakfast food was typical danishes, bagels, coffee, tea, juices, fresh fruit. The staff were great at replenishing the items and very helpful. The negatives, the room was small (2 double beds) for myself, hubby and 2 teen girls. I guess as this hotel is so central, the breakfast hours of 6:30 am to 9:30 am doesn't allow tourists to sleep in a bit before getting a bite. (I solved this by grabbing a few items & bringing it upstairs for the sleepyheads lol.) We plan on visiting NYC again & this hotel is definitely at or near the top of the list for our next stay. Another plus, plus was the staff was always helpful and courteous. The concierge was also helpful in suggesting places he would eat at. Nothing beats eating at places the locals eat it. After checking out and just before we entered the Lincoln Bridge, our teen realized she had possibly left her cellphone in the room.

You are literally 5 minutes away from the Empire State building, there's a metro station 3-4 blocks away, there's restaurants and small stores all around and you are 10 minutes walk from Times Square. It is a very small building, almost hidden between 2 bigger buildings, and the entryway is small as well. Do your check-in, check-out and pay while the front desk staff are not busy because the main lobby is small and you don't want to wait there for awhile. Breakfast is included in the price and you have to go in the basement to get it. I believe it is served from 0630-09h, but better get there before 08-08h30 or else there is no seat available. There enough variety (eggs, bacon (except during week-ends), pancakes, pastries, yogurts, cereals, juices and coffee, etc.) The rooms are small but comfortable enough if you put aside the fact that it is INHUMANLY cold. There's a huge window to provide natural light to the room, but there is no insulation whatsoever. This creates a very cold floor, wall, and furniture close to the window. Evidently, the bed near the window was also very cold and lacked warm blankets. I had to ask the staff to bring at least 3 warm blankets to compensate for the cold. The heating system is at the other side of the room and doesn't reach the bed near the window. This was a major problem, affecting sleep and health. The blankets helped but they couldn't warm the ambient air. The hotel should definitely find a way to warm up these sides of the room. There was a lot of noises, even during the night (but hey, this is NYC, so do not expect the city to quiet down at night). There was also lots of noises from the hallway, because of the way they are made, doors are slamming all the time. Bring earplugs and you'll solve at least all the noise problems. Wifi was not working consistently. Working better, for example, in the early morning then during the evening. But I was not in NYC to remain on the internet in my room, so this was not so much of a problem. Staff are available 24hrs at the desk and were quick enough to bring the blankets (20-30 minutes). If you know you get cold easily, and you visit during winter time, ask for blankets while checking in, that will save you time. Without this major issue, this hotel would have scored 5 stars easily. I still would recommend it. You won't find many hotels that offers great breakfast, central location and convenient rooms for such prices. I would go back, but not during winter!","Ottawa, Canada",35,4.0

Three different individuals at the desk over the 5 nights I was there provided great restaurants, directions and helpful tips. I'd had 13 boxes of varying size sent beforehand for a convention and one of the gentlemen there brought them up from storage and helped load them. The location was great. Penn Station and subways to all parts of the city were just a few minutes away. They also have a Citibike location right around the corner where you can use the bikes and drop off at different locations around the city.

I felt like the staff at the desk was continuously looking down and was not knowledgeable with the area or places to eat when asked; it felt like we were interrupting them from ""something"" when we asked a question. I don't remember them smiling, not once - well, it is New York, I guess. Room was cleaned well, but why on earth did they leave our dirty bar glasses behind?

Weather during our visit was frigid, the weekend before the Super Bowl, but the room was very comfortable. The property is relatively new. The bed was very comfortable. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The breakfast was typical Best Western but with the low priced room it was an inexpensive New York breakfast. Do not go to the breakfast room late as a surge of last second rookie tourists jam the room. Go earlier and you have the room to yourselves. We have been visiting NYC for over 15 years. We would definitely consider this hotel again. We saved enough on the room to pay for our meals and two shows while in town for three days.

It did not affect our stay at all so unless a large room is important to you this would not be a problem. In contrast to the small room the shower was lovely and big. It was powerful and we always had plenty of hot water. The hairdryer was brilliant too - better than my own!The room only has a coffee maker. No kettle so no freshly boiled water for a ‘proper’ cup of tea. There were urns of coffee and hot water in the foyer by the lift. A welcome touch after a hard days sight seeing as we could grab a drink on the way to our room.The complimentary breakfast was fine. There was something for everyone. We didn’t use the bar.Finally I would say that I expected a view of the Empire State Building. We had a view of the street. This was entirely my fault for not researching this properly beforehand.

The hotel is 2 blocks from the station, great location. This hotel is less than a year old and very clean. The rooms are compact, but my wife & I had no problem with the small space. We did say, as a couple, we could not stay more than 2 nights in this size of a room. If either of us were here alone on business there would be no problem with this room for 3 or 4 nights. It is easy walking to fine restaurants, shopping and activities. We had tickets to a Broadway matinee show Sunday and were able to walk the short 10 blocks. This hotel has a nice bar lounge on the first floor the prices are very reasonable for NYC. They even have a ‘Happy Hour’ weekdays 3-7. There is no restaurant in this hotel. They do provide a free breakfast which is typical Best Western not bad/not great. We were satisfied with this self service meal (saved about $40 not having to buy breakfast). The hot items were pancakes, sausage patties and eggs (I think these are frozen and heated for breakfast, this was not a problem for us). There was a hot chafing dish with oatmeal that my wife enjoyed. The coffee was good and a good selection of tea. There were pastries, breads, cold cereal, fresh fruit & yogurt to choose. The lobby has free hot coffee & tea all day. The value of this hotel is very good for NYC. The staff is very professional and treated all with respect. This is a small boutique hotel, less than 100 rooms. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who does not need a large plushy room.

This seems to be a really new hotel that has been squeezed in between two other tall buildings – our cab driver couldn’t find it initially and had to do some tricky manoeuvring on the street outside. The rooms were pretty small but big enough for the three of us for the limited time we spent in the room; when you are in a city like NYC you just need somewhere to rest your head! It was all really nicely fitted out and the shower was huge! The location is really good, just minutes from the Empire State Building, Macy’s and the shops on 42nd Street. There are also some food options nearby such as 5 Boro Burger and there is a subway stop for Herald Square on the next block. We ate breakfast every day in the breakfast room (this was included in our rate) and we didn’t struggle for seating/have to queue. There were different hot options each day along with bagels, muffins, cereal etc. We did eat early (jet lag) and noticed that by about 8.30am it was getting busier. We enjoyed happy hour drinks in the bar most afternoons where the staff were lovely and it was never too busy. The only real negative was on our departure – we asked about transport to the airport and they booked us a cab but this actually turned out to be a towncar which would have charged us over double what we’d pay in a yellow cab. A bit annoying but we flagged down a cab outside the hotel instead.","Sheffield, United Kingdom",3,4.0

Very simply, it checks all of the boxes any traveller would be looking for;- Very clean (no hair in shower, bathroom spotless, room and public spaces always clean)- Recently renovated (carpet still smells new, furniture looks great, everything works)- Great free hot breakfast (eggs, bacon, pastries, juices, coffee, etc.)- Fast and free wifi (skype videocalls worked just fine)- Friendly and welcoming staff (no issues during my stay, but everyone was nice for regular encounters)The only two negatives - the rooms are very tight and there is no valet. This is a small hotel, wedged between two buildings, so the space is limited (the closet is probably 1/4 of what you are used to in a normal hotel room and there is very limited open space). I had no issues at all, but for a family, it could get tiring for an extended stay. The lack of valet is mostly fine, as there is a garage a few buildings down on W36th, but it could be a minor inconvenience on check-out. Since the street is one way, you're pretty much stuck walking a few minutes down the road with your bags to get your car (much faster than getting your car and going around the block back to the hotel). Again, I had no issues whatsoever with this, but it might be annoying for some, depending on the circumstances.Overall - a fine hotel at a truly great price.

My midway, tenth-floor room was directly opposite the elevator, yet I was seldom bothered by the comings and goings of my fellow guests or staff.The layout--especially for business travellers--is somewhat awkward as the work station more or less blocks easy passage to the two queen beds. The unseasonably cool weather was too much for the ceiling-installed heating system: even after setting the temperature in the high 70s, the floor area never really got warm. The hotel's Wi-Fi was woefully inadequate: sending emails was hit and hiss depending on the whim of the server; downloading even moderately sized files was consistently truncated before all of the bytes had dutifully arrived (thank goodness for my Bell turbo stick which finally began working as advertized).On the plus side, the daily happy hour had genuine bargains and attentive staff; the lower level breakfast buffet offered a commendable variety of hot and cold selections along with typically efficient staff.If the technical challenges can be overcome for the business traveller and the heat somehow tweaked to provide warmth from head to toe, then this hotel would be highly recommended to one and all.","St. Catharines, Canada",61,3.0

They went out of their way to help all the members (most were 16-18 years old) of our group feel at home and seemed to enjoy speaking with them each day about how things were going. Even though some kids deactivated their keys on a regular basis, the staff always smiled, made another key and helped them figure out what they were doing wrong.6. There is a patio out front that allows you to meet up as a group before going out for the day and without blocking the lobby.7. The hotel staff anticipates your needs.

We arrived early (5 hours before our booking) because of our cruise-ship disembarkation but the staff was very willing to let us put our suitcases into storage, grabbed a fresh (always available coffee) and complementary maps for our morning walk. You couldn't ask for a better hotel location close to everything in Manhatten, even though we walked 10 km a day - it was well worth it. When we got to our room, we had booked a King-size bed but they gave us two double beds. Explaining our booking, they made things right and moved us to our requested room. Room is decent size, definitely not big but sufficient. Very new and clean! Breakfast area and food was very good - an expectation of all Best Westerns. Cost is more than you would like to spend but this is Manhatten!

And some of the rooms on the highest floors have a gorgeous close-up view of the Empire State Building.

There are loud clanking sounds emanating from the elevator shaft whenever the elevator stops. It is especially loud when the elevator stops on the floor your room is on. And it becomes quite noticeable when the 2 elevators start to get used early in the morning. I suspect the sound is caused by a cable slapping against the shaft or at least that's what it sounds like. Staff, who are aware of the issue, say that it is more noticeable on the higher floors.

Fortunately the depth of the desk was so shallow (and not really usable) that we could get the suitcase through, but it cleared both pieces of furniture by about an inch. The bathroom was similarly very small. The breakfast choices were somewhat limited compared to what I think of as a comparable hotel, like a Holiday Inn Express. The sausages were inedible and the staff didn't refill serving platters until they were empty, so guests had to wait for food. We checked out in mid-morning but didn't have a flight until the evening, so the staff agreed to keep our bags while we did a little tourism during the day.

Hotel supplies free WiFi and a complementary breakfast. The breakfast has everything you need to start the day with your choice of cereal, different types of bread and bagels, eggs, fruit, etc.Rooms aren't big, but pretty standard for a Manhattan hotel room. The look and feel of the room is great and rooms are well kept (in part because everything is new). The bed was VERY nice and comfortable.

The 1st stay had some hiccups. My 1st 3 nights were booked using my BW reward points and upon check in, the front desk insisted that a voucher was needed even though I produced documents that said otherwise. I had to call BW international customer service with my overseas line to get them to clarify directly with the front desk. It was finally resolved that the voucher was not needed. At checked out, I was billed for 3 nights : room + tax (state, city, etc.) around USD110+. I was told they were standard charges. However, only upon pushing for clarification as to what they were meant for, the same front desk then struggled to explain. Luckily, there was another manager (sorry, I did not get his name) around who finally resolved and void my payment. I guessed it is always good to ensure sufficient time for check out and in this case, to review the bill while waiting for our airport shuttle to catch our early morning 7am flight. I can only assume that that front desk personnel was not sufficient trained to work with computer.Thank goodness, everything went well with my 2nd stay. The Hotel is in good location with Empire States Building and shopping streets (Macy, etc.) just round the corner. There are many eateries of different cuisines just down the various streets. The room was small but bed was comfortable and have everything we need. The breakfast was reasonable although dining area was rather small and at certain timing, it was packed. Since we have the time on our hand, we did not mind coming back again at later time. The free hot beverages were great especially for my mum who enjoyed some hot drinks especially during the evening time. Special thanks to the various front desk personnel (Laura, Jeetender and Mustafa) for being most helpful in providing useful pointers on locations, transportation and activities to do. The breakfast crew were friendly and ever ready with their greetings.My past experience with BW in the various regions have been good and I will continue to look for BW to stay.","Singapore, Singapore",0,4.0

The room is small but very comfortable with all the basics: desk, safe, hair dryer, toiletries, etc. Free wi-fi is also available. Excellent place to stay in New York especially if you book one of their great offers.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that a little after we got into our room, maintenance came to the door asking for access to change AC filters. Given that check in is at 3:00 pm I think they have plenty of time to do this before guests arrive. It disrupted us a little because we were in a hurry and almost out the door and we had to wait until they did the job and freed up the entrance to the bathroom. The technician was very apologetic and nice but I think it's a mistake of the hotel to send them at this time. The other reason is that although breakfast is included which is awesome, the space to sit is tiny and it's hard to find where to sit. Also, bread and fruit run out pretty fast.

New hotel I chose thanks to Trip Advisor and the great comments it had. I booked a room in July for 3 adults. On Best Western website I could book a room with a king size bed for the 3 of us. I assumed they would not let me book something that didn't correpond to what I needed. I still called the number on my confirmation and got someone on the phone who retrieved my reservation. I asked ""There is one double bed, there is 3 of us... Where is the third person gonna sleep ?"" I got answered ""There is a sofa bed in your room as it is an Executive room"".... Fine by me ! The price and location were interesting. I called back at the beginning of September to make a request. My reservation was checked again. I requested a view on the Empire State Building and was told that the type of room I booked automatically had a view on that building. All seemed perfect !!!Then the day came when we got up early in the morning after a cruise, to go take the plane to NYC then take pulic transportation.... we arrive around 5.30pm, tired but excited to discover the city for the first time !We start checking in and the lady realises that there is 3 of us and only one bed in the room. We were also told the hotel was full that night and that they could not accomodate us with another type of room. I told them about the sofa bed..... ""We have no sofa bed in the hotel"" WHAT ????!!!!! I asked to see the room, there would have been room for an extra single bed but THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY ! What was offered was to sleep in the same bed !!!!!! It was said so naturally that it seems to be something that is offered pretty often ! ONE MORE THING IS that the room we visited did NOT have a view on the Empire State Building when I was told the room I had booked had one for sure !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The guy there was like ""We are full, we cannot do anything"".... What about trying to check who would have answered me or trying to sort us out in an other Best Western ?? NO instead we were told, ""We are full, other hotels are gonna be full as well"" .................Well, we went to the hotel next door, that actually had a room with a sofa bed available, breakfast included at a much better rate ! So we just cancelled and went to give money to competition !It was my first reservation with Best Western...... :/What I would like to add is that at 5.30pm they still asked if rooms were ready, that is not showing good hotel management, we were offered 10% discount if we stayed there..... for the 3 of us to sleep in the same bed it would have to be much much more !!!!The way things have been handled was bad, the fact the I was able to book this room for 3 adults is a shame !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The hotel was designed with a high-end boutique look and feel as well as upscale amenities. Overall, we find the facilities very clean and good customer services provided. * Perfect location and convenient to majority of Manhattan tourist attractions. Short walking distance to Herald Square and Penn Station subway stations. During our stay, we mainly took subways to our chosen destinations. From the hotel's Midtown location, we were able to walk to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Pier 83 (for Circle Line sightseeing cruise of Manhattan), and nearby Time Square. Macy's is only a stone thrown away along with many high-end shops on 5th Avenue. It is easy to maneuver the grid setting of New York city streets. * Great selection of breakfast items served every morning at a room located in the cellar, which include several types of breads, danishes, yogurt, eggs, sausages, pancakes, oatmeal, raisins, bananas and various kinds of dry cereals. In addition, two types of juices, water, coffee and choices of tea bags are available. We LOVE the little croissants and the Denver style egg white patties. The breakfast ladies kept the items decently stocked, and only a short wait for available table during the height of breakfast hours.* Coffee and various types of tea bags service available right by the elevator - we grabbed a cup of tea every night upon returning to the hotel after spending a long day wandering out in town as a nightcap.* Bathroom is well design with great use of space. Glass shower door in lieu of curtain is definitely a PLUS! * Even though our room is right across from the two elevators, we find it to be rather quiet, and can only hear the dings from the elevators or conversations from people outside our room only when we are standing close to our room door.* Floor to ceiling window makes the room airy. Other than a night with police action nearby that we heard police sirens, we can barely hear any noises on 36th Street, even though our room is located below the double digits floors..Slight DISAPPOINTMENTs:* Being Diamond status of Best Western Reward Program, we were placed on a single digit floor, even after requesting for upper floors on our reservation placed over two months ago. We paid over $260 (without taxes and charges) for room with 2 beds. Comparing to the amount posted by other TripAdvisor reviewers, compounding with the fact that their stays are during the peak summer travelling season, paid far less than us and yet have been placed on floors much higher than us, we felt that the hotel is slightly over-priced for our mid-September stay.* Room is on the small side. We need to be very organized with placement of our luggage, and not having toiletries and clothing items spread all over due to limitation of spaces. The beds are also on the short, feet sticking out of the beds even for individuals that are 5' 7"" in height. (LOL, cruise cabin is larger than the hotel room)",No. Cal.,42,4.0

We actually had a decent view from room 1601 which is an executive room and bigger. There were only 5 rooms on our floor. The bed was super comfortable. In room safe and coffee maker, big shower with rain shower head, no tub. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They have good maps at the front desk with subway stops listed. Small business center with a printer. Free breakfast was quite good with cooked eggs and sausage...even cooked egg whites for those who prefer that. There is a nice outdoor sitting area for smoking or people watching or just having your coffee. We found it wasn't a bad walk to Times Square at all and mostly walked everywhere we went. There is also a small quiet lounge/bar off the lobby. We would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again.","Charlottetown, Canada",40,5.0

The view was only of the other buildings from across the street, but the windows were generous in size. The size of the room itself was relatively small, but still comfortable for a pair on a king size bed. What made this place amazing was the location of this hotel. You cannot get a better location than here - literally blocks away from times square, everything was within walking distance, which includes all the tourist destinations (i.e. empire state building, macy's, NBC studios, etc...) but tucked in a middle of a quiet street with not too much traffic.

The hotel was conveniently located and the rooms were well-kept, with adequate amenities so we found this to be of good value compared to other hotels nearby. However, the service was lousy and definitely not something we would expect in a 'premier' hotel. Firstly, when we asked for the front desk staff to help us book a shared shuttle to the airport, what arrived to pick us up was a personal taxi. If the staff had told us at any point that he was unable to book a shared shuttle service, we would have understood. But it was quite clear that he was being dishonest and guests were left with no time to make transportation changes as we had to reach the airport on time.The other poor service we encountered was from this serving lady at the breakfast cafe. We noticed that she would greet guests on the breakfast line, but when it came to asian guests, she would put on an unhappy face. We said good morning to her for 3 days and all we got in return was a nonchalant look. Once, she was topping up the breads section with more doughnuts, and I waited patiently for her to be done. The next minute, she asked a gentleman behind me what he would like and proceeded to serve him. I did the normal thing which was to tell her my request, and she replied ""you have to wait until I am done!"". Another time, she was topping up another dish, and guests in front of me continued to pick from that tray. When it came to my turn and I did the exact same thing as those before me, she stared hard at me as if I had committed a crime! As a well-travelled couple who is respectful and friendly to every country we visit, we found no other reason to be treated this way except for the way we look.It is unfortunate that the good image of this hotel is tarnished by staff who choose to be dishonest and who discriminate guests. All I can say to the serving lady is, you need to travel more to see the world beyond.

This hotel had a nightly room rate (booked through the Best Western on the web) for our stay ranging from $225 to $360 PLUS taxes ranging from $36.69 to $56.60 for an average nightly rate of more than $336.00. This may be inexpensive for New York, but it is not very good value for money. This new hotel is located in what remains of the 'garment district' on 36th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues. It is convenient to both uptown and downtown buses and the subway, each being a two minute walk from the hotel. The street is nondescript light industrial with a sprinkling of restaurants. The hotel is one of three in a row on the street. It is relatively small (92 rooms) and the rooms are extremely small. The bathroom has a shower (poor water pressure) but no tub. For some reason the tap water in our room had a terrible taste about which the management did nothing upon being told of the problem. The bed was firm and the pillows were rock hard. For some reason the air conditioning duct is placed directly over the bed making for an uncomfortable situation. The worst problem with the room was the complete lack of sound proofing. We could hear everything from the room next to us, from the corridor and from the street (and our room was on the 17th floor so the street sounds had to travel quite a way to be heard in the room).Breakfast, included in the price, was adequate for this kind of hotel, but nothing special. The room was crowded each morning which usually meant waiting for a table. The breakfast staff did a good job of replenishing food items and keeping the room clean. The chamber maids did a good job, although they did arrive a bit early on Sunday morning (before 9.00).I doubt we would stay at this hotel again.

When I returned, they assured me it was cleaned, it was not!.. I went back down, and they called the cleaning supervisor who again assured it was cleaned, so the manager and desk staff came with me, to my room..and guess what, they were just going into my room to clean it finally...ao that was a lie clearly, by the cleaning supervisor. I appreciated the efforts to get my issues sorted, and the young lady cleaning was so polite as she was not aware of what was going on. But, I think the supervisor had some problems, that spoiled this place getting a 5 star rating. Also, on one other occasion, I returned to my room at 3pm, and it was not cleaned yet.... so I spoke to the cleaner myself, and by 4pm it had been done. (I didnt report it a second time, as it might end up in her getting fired, the supervisor who was poor to be honest).Finally, the bar was nice, and big screen TVs and a great happy hour selection, also the free Wifi was very useful too.

The only thing this hotel has going for it is that it is new. If you like being in the hub of tourist New York, then you’ll like this location, but if you want to stay near decent restaurants or away from the tourist craziness, look elsewhere. The rooms are tiny, less than two feet between the end of the bed and the dresser. The lighting in the room and the bathroom is so dim it is hard to read and put on makeup. The windows curve inward making it impossible to see down to the street, but you’ll hit your head trying. The street view is directly into the office buildings across the street. The windows also don’t open, so claustrophobics beware. The ill-fitting curtains don't do a good job of keeping out the light. The bed is uncomfortable as are the large foam pillows. The bathroom has no towel racks, just a hook on the back of the door that already has a bag containing the hair dryer hanging from it, no fan, and no room for toiletries. In the five days we stayed here, they did not replace the soaps once, even when they were down to a sliver - a first in my hotel experience. No cotton balls or Q-tips. The water pressure in the shower is very weak. Housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 Sunday morning (!!) so we never got to sleep off our Saturday night out. The breakfast room is cramped and the quality of the breakfast is poor. There is no security at all which means anyone can walk in and go up the elevators if they look like a guest, and which unfortunately for us meant that they had no resources to deal with the unruly guests who partied all night in the room next door to us - they comped us for our sleepless night. The staff was unimpressive. I was kicking myself because just to try something new I cancelled my reservation at the Hilton Fashion District where we’ve stayed a number of times, which I had reserved at the same rate as this hotel, and which suffers from none of these numerous defects.

I do agree that the plastic knives don't cut bacon that well. The lift arrival may be a little slow at breakfast time, but we did not mind, we are on holiday after all. Our room on the 16th floor provided us with a HUGE bonus, a view of the Empire State building!The coffee and tea in the lobby was a bonus, could get one on the fly while walking to the Metro, or going to your room.The room size was smallish, but what do you expect in NY, all functional with clean modern bathroom and fittings. Nice.The gym was clean and airconditioned. The STAFF, especially Jatinder was SUPERB, as were all the others we had contact with, courteous, helpful and unintrusive; printing off information for the tennis and travel directions, without the need to use the one man station business centre. Wireless internet was fast and easy to setup.","Auckland, New Zealand",18,5.0

Ours was clean, but for a ""brand new"" hotel, I was disappointed that the shower head wasn't even screwed on tightly, and the shower and wardrobe door hinges were already broken.

The pictures on the hotel website show the Empire State Building in the background - sorry, they must have been photo shopped because, although within walking distance, you definitely don't see it from your window. What we actually saw from our window were 3 brick apartment buildings and a bunch of roof vents. When we asked if there were any other rooms available, we were told they were all booked for the evening - okay, it as a Friday; but no offer was made to consider another room when it became available. In addition, the room was incredibly small - very close quarters. This was my 5th trip to NYC so I know rooms are generally small, but this one was exceptional - 2 people couldn't walk by the end of the bed at the same time. When we checked in there was a rubber glove laying on the floor of the bathroom and an empty soap box on the floor, as well. After that, the housekeeping seemed fine - although they had a nasty habit of turning the AC very low, so that every day, when we came back from a warm day of sightseeing, we actually had to turn the heat on to warm the room to an acceptable temperature. The subway was close, but not super convenient. Didn't find the staff overly accomodating - especially the breakfast staff ... really had to work hard to get a smile there. I've stayed in 3 other places in NYC and can honestly say, I don't think I'll be back here. Maybe I'm just too fussy with my dollars.","Lacombe, Canada",20,3.0

The location is excellent. We could get on and off almost every subway line with-in a 5 minute walk. Just my teenage niece and myself traveling, we felt perfectly safe walking around the whole area until the wee hours of the night. There were always a lot of people around. I loved that there is a Duane Reade drug store and a McDonald's a half of block away, perfect for drinks and snacks. We had a repair issue with the plumbing trap door- they immediately sent someone to do repairs. Upon check out, I was delayed on business, my niece was worried about having be alone checked out of the room. Front desk allowed her to stay as a late check out, which I was told is virtually unheard of in NYC- It was much appreciated and the special care made me like this hotel even more.

As a comparison, I've stayed at the Royalton and paid twice as much, and the room was no bigger.

Fortuitously, I snagged a very favorable rate, which led me to choose the hotel. It was also convenient to my business meetings in Times Square, though I must say that the walk in 90 degree heat and 90% humidity was daunting.My room was small--typical New York size--but had all of the amenities. Free wi fie is provided and the desk has ample outlets. There are also outlets by the two nightstands. I mention that because I cannot tell you how many times I have been in hotels, including grand ones, when finding a free outlet for a computer, cellphone or appliance proved a challenge. The bath was actually nice sized with very nice amenities, e.g., excellent shampoo and conditioner, mouthwash, body lotion and--to my delight--a decent sized bar of soap, not the ones that are so thin they are hard to handle.The heat was scorching, so I welcomed the excellent air conditioning which kept the room pleasantly cool. It is controlled by a thermostat on the wall, always a welcome change from the window units or the heat pump like units controlled at the unit.Breakfast is included and that, too, was a delightful surprise. There were two attentive staff members to serve the bacon, sausage, eggss, breakfast potatoes and wide variety of sweet rolls. There is also a small fitness center on the lower level with the breakfast room.The location is terrific. It is a short walk to Times Square, over the the Empire State Building and that general area, and to several other neighborhoods. On the other hand, the subway is a stone's throw away, so all of New York is at your doorstep.Like most New York hotels, rate vary widely from day to ay. When I sought to return to the hotel on a return business visit, I found the price double what I had paid the first time. Prices always reflect, I think, supply and demand, season, events, etc. However, I would certainly hope to snag another favorable rate and return to the best Western Premier at Herald Square at some point.

It was our first time visiting and we were concerned...very concerned...about where to stay and whether we would be wasting our precious vacation time by staying at a hotel that was far from everything. So we decided to try the Best Western Premier HERALD SQUARE. It was by far the most ideal location we could have stayed at...and I am confirming it in retrospect through this review.As you may know, NYC is an old city with very expensive real estate...including hotel stays that are costly on a nightly basis. It is not uncommon to pay a minimum of $250/night...and that at an average hotel. What sets this hotel apart from other hotels including other BW's in NYC is that the the BW Herald Square is a BRAND NEW HOTEL...just opened its doors in mid-May 2013!! This means that all the rooms and furniture and bedding is new...and it was!!! It was fabulous!!! NYC being an old city with old real estate you will be staying in worn out and tired rooms unless you fork over $800+ a night. As an experiment I checked out the rates at a hotel only 2 minutes walking distance from this hotel: they were charging $450++ per night!!!! And it was a similar class/standard but was NOT a brand new hotel.As for location, we took the M60 bus from Laguardia airport (bought a 7 day pass for $30 at the airport) to Astoria stop, then hopped on the N train which took us to Herald Square station. The Best Western Herald Square was a 2 minute walk!!! We were so happy! It gets even better. The Herald Square station also has several other trains that pass through it giving you great access to so many different parts of NYC...with Times Square only ONE STOP away!!! You just cannot beat that!!! Have fun in NYC when you stay at this hotel.And lastly...the hotel staff is superb!! Kudos and many thanks to Mustafah, the hotel manager who made us feel so welcome and ensured we enjoyed our stay. And finally I would say that if you are a fan of the BW chain...THIS is the one to stay at when you visit NYC.",,17,5.0

The BWP was an ideal location as I did not want to rent a car. With meetings in Times Square, SOHO, Midtown West, the hotel's location allowed for easy access to all whether by foot or cab. The hotel was new and so everything was in great condition. I was impressed with the free internet (which worked wonderfully) and that the TV remote was bagged and noted as a clean remote. If you read about the dirtest spots in your hotel room, this was nice. The room was quiet. On the downside, it was a bit small, but then again it did have two beds. Also I could not get the room's temp below 67. I prefer it to be colder when I sleep. The other thing that struck me odd, was that breakfast was offered to 10:00, but the first day I was there it was shut down at 9:30.

(I expect the price to rise as the hotel will get more popular for sure)The Staff was super friendly and helpful, too bad i can't remember their names, everything was clean and fresh. I even wondered if the towels in the room were on their first use. Room is a bit under the standard room size, however it didn't feel too small with the nice big windows.The only thing, which i'm pretty sure it is fixed by now, i would have love to have chairs and tables on the small terrace in front of the hotel.Will go again if the price stays right.","Mirabel, Canada",35,5.0

This is a new building and you can tell it's new inside as well. Front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful from the time we arrived till the time we left. Every morning they asked if we needed help for anything as we were leaving, did we need directions, subway routes, etc.The room wasn't big but then I didn't expect it to be after all I'd read about hotel rooms in NY. It was plenty big and there was room on each side of the king size bed. The closet is really small, like twice the size of a locker, so don't plan on hanging a lot of clothes. Our room was on the 14th floor and faced 36th Street. We had a great view of the Chrysler Bldg and all the happenings along the street. It was really quiet, could hear very little street noise, not sure if it's like that on lower level rooms.The hotel is advertised as being in Herald Square. It is right at Herald Square but the sign on the street said Fashion District. There are plenty of places to eat right around the hotel if you don't feel like walking far. Yes, there is a huge, free, continental breakfast. However, the pricing shows the cost is $10.99. I was told they were doing it free as an introductory special. I wouldn't pay that much to eat the breakfast but for free it was great. A couple of doors down is a brand new place called Pure Fresh. They offer all meals and have a great selection. It's super clean inside as they just opened.The hotel will store your luggage for you if you have a later flight than checkout. No, there isn't bottled water in the rooms but I'm not sure why you'd need it. The tap water tasted good and is safe to drink. There is also coffee, tea, and ice water in the front lobby at all times. There is a desktop computer and printer in the basement. Worked out great to be able to print boarding passes, etc. since I didn't bring my laptop. There is free wifi throughout the hotel as well.","Springfield, Missouri",141,5.0

It was really easy to get around from this location and the hotel did a great job. The rooms are small like many in NYC but very functional and as it is a new place, exceptionally clean.

Two families in a party of seven was able to travel with relative ease around the city. We stayed 4 nights. Staff very friendly and helpful, with a smile every morning.

On the positive, everything is new, clean and fresh. On the negative, there were still some little things here and there which were missing (outlet coverings). There are two elevators but only one was working the day we were there. We got an excellent price on the hotel and it was larger than a previous hotel we had stayed at in NYC. It is in close proximity to Times Square which was nice and also close to the subway.",denver,21,4.0

This was my 11th trip to New York City . I usually stay at Thompson Hotels. However, this time, with a great Grand Opening rate, I chose Best Western. Hotel had been open for 2 weeks so everything was new. Some parts of the hotel were not yet open such as the main floor bar & patio. There is also talk of a rooftop patio in the future. The hotel is a new build hotel just around the corner from Herald Square and 6 subway lines. Times Square is a 15 minute walk away; Empire State Building is a 10 minute walk.The Staff were very friendly and accommodating. I was in town the night before for dinner and dropped by and asked if I could see the rooms since there were no photos on the website. The head of housekeeping was proud to show off her hotel. So I got to see most of the room types: They have king rooms; double queens and on the top 2 or 3 floors a larger King room in the same space as the double queens room so much more roomy looking out onto 36th Street. There are 94 rooms on 17 floors so only 6 rooms per floor. The hotel has a small gym with weights; a walking machine, an elliptical and I think a fixed bicycle with a water cooler and towels. It’s on the same floor as the business center – which is just a single desktop in a cubbyhole – next to the breakfast area.Breakfast is included. You have a choice of cereals; bread; bagels; a toaster; bacon; sausage; scrambled eggs; oatmeal; coffee; tea; juices; yogurt. I requested a high floor with a view and received room 1505. The room comes with a great view of the Empire State Building. If you want that view I think you’d have to be on the 14th floor or higher in rooms ending in 04; 05 or 06. However, rooms ending in 01; 02 or 03 have floor-to-ceiling windows. The room is quite small but I’ve seen smaller in New York. However, the room has most things that you need. There is a large flat screen TV (with a genius remote control that gets cleaned every change of client); an iHome Clock Radio with iphone 4 connection; a safe; ironing board/Iron; about 8 hanger in a fairly small closet (we had to take out the ironing board to fully use the closet); and 3 drawers that can be used for storage. There is also a small desk and coffee maker in the room. Bedding was very comfortable but the bed did seems a little shorter than my bed at home (I'm 6' 3""). Towels in the bathroom were surprisingly soft for a budget hotel.The bathroom is also quite small but well laid out with a shower with glass door instead of the usual tub. This is great as those hotel tub curtains always give me the heebee-geebees. There is not much storage room in the bathroom so you end up leaving a lot of your toiletries in the room itself. Bathroom had no fan which is a pity as it’s good for hiding noise when using the bathroom. Fairly nice toiletries were included along with enough towels. There was also a shaving mirror.Rooms seem very quiet to outside noise and we didn’t hear our neighbors except for slamming of doors in the morning. However, with only 6 rooms per floor – we had a fairly quiet time in the rooms. Rooms 04; 05 and 06 are away from the elevators as well so less noise there as well.Climate control is individually operated in each hotel room which is also good.Both the room and bathroom were immaculately clean.There is no minibar in the room nor is there room service but there is a takeout menu for the Keg Room – an upscale Irish Pub directly across the street.Overall we had a great stay with a couple of hiccups - both of which I reported and both which the front desk staff tried to resolve quickly. For 2 of the days we came back to the room by 5pm and the room wasn’t made up but we left for another hour and the room was completed. Also, one day the safe did not work and we had a repair guy there within 10 minutes. Overall, I’d put these down to growing pains with a new hotel and don’t really think it’s endemic. Front Desk asked us about the issues when we left and made notes on it. One more thing - you can store your bags if you aren't heading directly out of the city. I’d certainly stay here again if the same great rate that I received. If the rate is similar to hotels with bigger and clean rooms then I'd probably reconsider.","Toronto, Canada",156,4.0

This new hotel is perfect in all ways. Excellent location to subway, attractions, 6 block walk to Times Sq. Empire State Building we look at out our window just one block walk away. The room is brand new so what can I say it is good size, beautiful, and quiet. The staff are very polite,courteous, friendly and helpful. It's a bonus to get breakfast included as this is not standard in NY. We have an excellent maid Martha, as well as the rest of the housekeeping staff. Also, the lady who takes care of breakfast is very polite and accommodating. I must also add Frank at the front desk is funny and a very happy man, who takes care of his guests. We leave in 2 days and will highly recommend this perfect hotel to all.","Calgary, Canada",10,5.0
