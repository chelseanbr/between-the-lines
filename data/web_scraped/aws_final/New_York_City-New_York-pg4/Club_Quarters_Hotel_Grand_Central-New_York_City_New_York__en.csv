There is also an outside patio area, with great views of NYC. The lounge is the place to be at the CQ. For breakfast there is fresh fruit (red & green apples, oranges, & bananas) and designer granola bars, such as Luna, Kashi, and Lara. After breakfast they offer fresh snacks such as Wasabi peas, M & M’s, Sesame sticks, etc., as well as packaged snack bags of popcorn, pita chips, etc., plus several different kinds of canned sodas. Then every day from 5-6 PM (also in the lounge) they have their free wine happy hour, where they offer glasses of red and white wines. Coffee, tea, and water are available all day long.

The telephone in the room was disconnected and when I called from my cell, they said they'd send someone right up. No one ever came up to fix it. The happy hour they offer is so below par. There's only about three 750 mL bottles of cheap wine and a few jars of bar snacks (trail mix, cinnamon raisin crisps). When those bottles run out, they don't replenish them. It's a really disappointing happy hour compared to other hotels' (servers, charcuterie plates, various olives/pickles, diff. breads, beer/diff. wines, etc.). The seating area is really outdated and kind of inconvenient for the size of the room. There was only one washcloth in the bathroom when we arrived, which was strange.

I wanted to spend a couple of nights in downtown Manhattan with my spouse to see a museum and the new Hudson Yards. I booked through Expedia as I often do. The $125 a night price on the Expedia site morphed into $165 with fees, taxes, etc. but being just a block from GST is a great location if you are arriving by train. Club Quarters is different, I’ll give them that. Definitely not a grand hotel feeling with a tiny lobby no real front desk and dim lighting. It’s a self-service almost dormitory vibe. There are amenities like a 27th floor terrace with snacks, coffee, computers and wine from 5pm to 6pm. There is an exercise place I did not visit. There is a closet on each floor with some items like steam irons available for guests but I could not get the coffee pods for the Keurig machine nor extra pillows I wanted and had to call the staff. They were accommodating.The elevator buttons worked intermittently which was a pain sometimes riding up and down trying to get my floor button and the keycard to work. The basic room I had was quite small and I think set up for one person although our reservation was for two. The bathroom had two bath towels, one face towel and one wash cloth. The shower was great. Housekeeping is fine. There is little counter space in the bathroom. There was a microwave, a fridge and the coffee maker but no safe. Expedia listed a safe in their description but Club Quarter’s web site did not list one. A message sent to the hotel asking about this went unanswered. The HVAC was just a little noisy but the street noise on a Friday night on the 19th floor was unsettling and not conducive to a good night’s sleep. Saturday night was more tranquil. I would not in the future accept a room across from the elevator the noise from which was also intrusive. We’re I young and traveling alone this hotel might be ok had I had a better room. I think for the price I could have found a place with less noise and more space.","Ware, Massachusetts",22,3.0

THE BAD. The rooms are ridiculously tiny even by Manhattan standards. The luggage surface accommodates only modest-sized suitcases, so I had to hoist my large suitcase onto the desk -- but it's not really a desk, just a horizontal board resting on somewhat wobbly legs, something clearly designed to look stylish more than offer any practical use. A lightbulb was out by the bed (sorry, but this is worth noting in a room with only two lamps) and the light at the bathroom mirror didn't work. Don't bother having any guest meet you in the lobby, which is a small room with no place to sit and a little ck-in stand like a restaurant maitre d' would use. When I asked for a 1pm checkout instead of noon, I was told that would cost an additional $50.

First impressions were ok, friendly staff and we were checked in right away. It appeared our request for a room on a higher floor was accommodated as we were put in 1904. The room had some definite wear and tear, and large water marks on the ceiling areas. Whatever, no drips, we didn't say anything about it. Quiet except for the sound of neighbour's door slamming and extremely loud AC (though it effectively cooled the room, so pro con). All seemed well but on the fourth night of our stay water started pouring from a vent in the ceiling onto our living room floor. Thank goodness we were in the room and were able to put a garbage can under the drip. When we called reception, they sent someone up to look but said their repairmen would not return til the next day. When we asked if any other rooms were available, they only offered a lower grade room on the second floor due to 'availability of room types'; a room on the 17th floor was promised to us the next day. To us, either a same or better grade room should have been offered to compensate. So we slept through the night with the dripping. Then, when it came time to move us, we were then told the room would be on the 15th floor, not 17th. Clearly they gave the room away. Maybe not a big deal in any other city, but for light sleepers in NYC, not the greatest. Still, we sucked it up and were determined not to let it ruin our trip. The clincher came when we checked out and were told by reception that ""we were good"" and had no outstanding charges. A week after arriving home, we noticed a charge for $150 or so on my visa. An email to the hotel asking what it was for said it was for room taxes, and that our third party booking site should have informed us, and that it wasn't their responsibility to do so on checkout! Appalling. To future hoteliers, I hope you use this as a case study in what not to do. Shame, as the location is convenient. Pick a different hotel!","Toronto, Canada",3,2.0

This hotel is supposedly renovated but in my opinion it is not 100% renovated. You can still feel the tiredness of the room, bedding, tiles, walsl in the washroom. Nevertheless, my husband and I enjoyed this hotel very much due to the location and service(coffee, free laundry and friendly staff), until I came home and checked my credit card statement. There was a charge of USD86. I was dumbfounded and contacted the hotel. According to the hotel it is the resort fee. Once again I found this extremely unreasonable. To avoid the resort fee or any kind of surprise hidden fee, I already have contacted CQ prior to my booking. In fact I have contacted Grand central branch + Wall St branch in NYC. These two branches of Club Quarters in NYC have confirmed me that there is no resort fee. Since I got the confirmation of no hidden fees by the hotel I went through and booked the hotel. However when I explained this, the hotel simply responded that there is a resort fee if you book through the third party. I found this answer this extremely unjust so I requested him to lift the resort fee. He refused and asked me to contact the manager. Later of the day I have contacted the manager and the manager confirmed again that he could not do anything about this and just reconfirmed that there always a resort fee if booking is done through the third party. As a customer we have a right to know all the exact details to make the reasonable decision. When I was requiring regarding the resort fee before the booking, no staff specified that I need to make a booking through their websites to avoid the resort fee charge! If I have known about this detail, I would not have booked this hotel. But now that I have already stayed and left the hotel they simply charged on my credit card. The hotel should have informed me PROPERLY on the first place the details and terms/conditions of the resort fee! I feel like I have been ripped off for no reason. Also when I was checking in and out there was no mention of the resort fee at all. It was simply charged on my credit card. I'm curious whether everyone who booked this hotel through the third party is aware of this nonsense. If there was no issue regarding the resort fee I have given 5 star on this hotel. But everyone please be aware of this misleading resort fee charge.","Toronto, Canada",0,1.0

The reception is small but I arrived at a good time and check in was instant. When full with people checking in and going up in the elevator it can look a little chaotic, but do not go on first impressions. The rooms are fine but there is more than meets the eye. Food can be ordered direct to the room from dozens of places or from the downstairs Italian place. The 27th floor room and balcony has free snacks, fruit and drinks all day (tea and coffee then wine from five). The internet is always free both in room and up on floor 27 with computers to use there.Meetings can be held there or just to relax. Your phone can become a mobile door key with their app which also acts as a guide when in New York. There is free chilled, purified water on each floor in refillable bottles. Rooms have yoga mats. There is a fitness floor. The TV has all kinds of functions beyond watching programmes such as streaming to it. There is a cupboard on the landing near the rooms with more room items to self-refill if needed. These are clever touches that really added to my stay. The rooms for central NY are a decent size with helpful bathroom items, iron and board, seating/office area and bed, various lighting options and USB charing. I only had three very minor issues. First, a slightly loose electrical fitting (room 2109 near the door) and secondly, a crack in the sink. The other minor issue was the loud noise of the air conditioning but that was because it was highly effective. After a while it can just be turned off. But these were minor issues and did not impact on my stay at all. Looking out directly at the Empire State building in front of me kind of balanced it out. The shower was good, towels are plentiful. The bed and bedding were fine. I like their commitment to minimising washes, you can choose when they change the bed and towels.I'll be back. The place is great, the staff are friendly and chat when they see you. It's a feel good place. The staff cannot be more helpful and importantly, they seem happy and proud to work there. We had some laughs and the free wine@5 kept flowing.Explore floor 27, order some food, get free coffees and cold water all day, try the linked restaurant directly from the hotel. Have free snacks, free fruit, relax in the club room and the balcony. This is a different experience, more like being in an apartment block than a hotel. But then apartments don't have free coffee either!I've given a five star review. I'm not saying this is a perfect place, the lobby is small, there are tiny quibbles I mentioned. But you know what, I didn't care a jot. The experience here was great, the staff were helpful and the various features are a step beyond other places. I think of this more like managed apartments than a hotel, if you have everything you need such as socket adaptors and so on, you'll have a great experience. This is a different experience to an old style hotel. The Thai food I ordered directly from my laptop is on my way to the room, last night it was great crispy chicken from another place. You manage your own staff here. Somehow any minor quibbles go away when you can order food, get free refills and relax looking out at central New York.",,0,5.0

Once in and settled though, checked out the club living room and that was it. Completely won over. Staff are a credit and deserve all their plaudits. Had a room on 20th floor to get away from street level noise as far as possible in NYC. Resort fee is reasonable in comparison to other hotels. The whole club room thing with wine and snacks is a winner and well worth a visit if you want to chill and re charge. Safety deposit boxes are in a strong room on second floor, which are a twin key arrangement (you and staff member), which seemed a bit inconvenient as apposed to room safes, but soon planned around this. We had a standard room rather than club room, which I believe were smaller, so would avoid if possible as a leisure traveller. Caught a few residents looking to change rooms at times in reception, which the staff seemed to be trying to accommodate. Reminded me of Premier Inn a touch back home at first. Can’t really add much more than the other positive reviews of this CQ hotel, with the staff being a credit to it (unfair to single anyone out, but I’m still not your type Chris ).

And as you can see, I’ve received an email from Club Quarters to rate the hotel. I’ve felt completely cheated because I had read bad reviews about Club Quarters and didn’t want to stay there, so it was a big surprise when I got to the address and there was only a sign saying it was Club Quarters, it was past 10pm and I had to enter and ask the recepcionist if the hotel was Hotel Boutique at Grand Central. About the hotel: I had asked for fridge and microwave, there wasn’t any at the room. The room is very tiny, you can’t even open 2 bags and walk through the room. The bed is queen size (little), I was told they don’t have king size beds. When I got to my room, the USB charger didn’t work, so I’ve called front desk asking if they had an adapter because I’m from Brazil and the outlet is different, they told me they didn’t have and I had to buy one (it was past 11pm). The bathroom is walk in shower but it’s fabric curtain, I don’t like it, and it didn’t show that on the pictures. I had booked for 3 nights but after all the problems we’ve decided to change hotels, so I asked for a refund for the last night, we stayed only 2 nights and I explained all the problems I had and that I thought it was a different hotel but indeed it was Club Quarters, even though, they charged me anyway for the 3 nights. It looks like they’ve been receiving bad reviews under the name of Club Quarters, so they’ve decided to use another name (Hotel Boutique at Grand Central) to improve their rating and mislead the customers. When I left, I asked them to hold my luggage for a couple of hours, when I returned to retrieve my luggage, it took a long time to find out where they were because the recepcionist didn’t even know that the hotel has another room upstairs to storage luggage. They say they receive packages for free, but I would advice that it doesn’t feel trustable, they doesn’t look organized and the reception area is very little. Only good point was the wine at afternoon and bottle of water for free.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ",58,2.0

Every day at 5 pm, until 6 PM, the hour of wine, Chris welcomes the guests with a big smile and generously pours wine, and on the roof floor there is a computer station and internet for use by the hotel guests.

The night shift guy that I interacted with ast the first night was rude, cold and not at all inclined to please or help. coming in tired after a long ride it wasn't a nice feeling talking to him.2. I booked a wheelchair accessible room and got a tiny room, almost impossible to maneuver and get around. I went down and asked whether there are other, bigger rooms (specifically asked about the 2nd floor) and the rude guy from above told me they are not ADA accessible. I went to sleep with a bad feeling and in the morning asked the clerk about bigger rooms and sure enough - there were two rooms on 2nd floor which were bigger and more suitable. I was transferred to that room and they didn't charge extra.All in all it's a good and clean hotel, but if you are a wheelchair user you need a a superior room (2nd floor). Also, the superior room was not perfectly accessible: the sink has a big peace of metal underneath that does not enable full access.

When I holiday I usually select reasonably priced locations with breakfast. However since I didn't want to waste a day changing hotels, I stayed on. This is a detailed review as I feel it is quite expensive for a tourist who spends the day out and only needs breakfast, a shower and a bed for the night.The carpeted room is a good size (for a single person), furnished with a large bed (queen I think - a bit too soft for my liking and the pillows were a bit lumpy), a chaise longue with a reading light, upholstered chair, matching headboard, pedestals, a table, flat screen TV, a full length mirror, wall mounted coat rack and a wardrobe. There is also a radio with a USB port to charge your phone which was a relief as I did not purchase a US plug. The duvet cover is made from a slippery material, so if you use the blanket from the wardrobe underneath, the duvet slips off. I found the air conditioning unit a bit strange, it would heat up the room and when it overshot the temperature, it would cool the room. The light switches are conveniently located at the door and below a pleasant reading lamp attached to the headboard.The cleaning staff keep the room so immaculate, I almost forgot to wear my shower shoes! You can leave a card on the bed so that you can help conserve water by not having your beddings changed. I bring this up for the reason below.The bathroom is also a good size for a single person, large mirror and a wall mounted magnifying cosmetic mirror. The shower itself is stupid, you have to turn to cold water to turn the tap off, so when you're lathered up, cold water shoots out and you waste water as you adjust to find your comfortable temperature again. So I kept the tap running for my shower instead of constantly fiddling with it. There is a hair dryer provided.There is a capsule coffee machine and coffee and tea in the room but no kettle to boil water for tea. You have to go up to the 27th floor for hot water. This bugged me as I drink 2 glasses of warm water after brushing my teeth. There is chilled water with water bottles available on every floor.There is a gym and washing machines available for guests to use on one of the floors but I didn't use (I'm not doing washing while there's places to go!).The living room on the 27th flooris relaxing and you can enjoy your morning coffee while admiring the Chrysler building. It has a flat screen TV, four PCs and free internet (WiFi is free and available throughout the hotel). Breakfast beverages are available all day but there's no breakfast. In the morning energy bars and fruit are available but the station is unmanned. For two straight days, I arrived only to leave for the elevator waiting area to ring reception to send someone up to empty the grounds out of the complicated coffee machine as the other guests couldn't be bothered. In fact, another guest felt it was more productive to beat the machine than call reception.Later in the day, the station is manned by fabulous hosts. Wasabi peas, salted peanuts sunflower seeds, pretzels, chips and my new best friend, a huge bottle of m and m's are available as well as a glass of wine at five.The staff at the hotel from the receptionists Ashley, a thin, short young man and a tall gentleman (I didn't get their names, sorry!), to the handyman and living room hosts, Elizabeth and Chris, are utterly delightful and want to be at your service.Ordinarily as a tourist, I would rate this type of hotel three stars because there's no breakfast and not having my own kettle was inconvenient but a cellphone charger in the room, free WiFi with excellent reception (which I needed thanks to MTN's crazy roaming charges), four PCs, a printer and exceptional staff tack on one more star.I think, in terms of value for money, this hotel is best suited to people who are looking to escape the hustle and bustle and value their privacy.","Durban, South Africa",7,4.0

The staff was friendly, the room clean and well laid out, and overall it was a good stay. The rooms are very small but well equipped, and the windows good enough to keep out most NY traffic noise (other than sirens). I particularly appreciated the thoughtfully laid out bathroom that managed to provide adequate surfaces to place things, very good lighting, and a well placed mirror. Sadly, it had no ventilation (I finally figured out that the fan was broken, too late to have it fixed for my stay), which meant that the bathroom smelled strongly of bleach from the hotel's cleaning products my entire stay. The second night I discovered how thin the walls were when a small child moved into the room next door. I couldn't hear its parents, but its toddler voice just poured through (of course, toddler voices have that ability). My only other beef is with the dismal coffee set up in the hotel ""living room."" There was one automatic espresso/coffee machine, which meant a very long line in the morning and then it was just bad. I discovered why when I saw a staff member refilling the milk reservoir with skim milk - blech!!!

Our greeting upon arrival was warm and friendly (as was all contact we had with the staff throughout our stay). The rooms are quite small (as are most NYC hotels), but it was well equipped with coffee machine, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The room was clean and well presented, the bathroom the same. I felt that the room itself could have worked a bit bitter with more useful storage and a better layout - for example there was a small table with seating around which we never made use of and nowhere to store our empty suitcases. Both of these things could be easily resolved and would have made our stay a little more comfy. I guess it’s ok if you are only staying a couple of nights, but for any longer can become a little frustrating. The air conditioning was effective, the bed very comfy and for a city centre hotel I was surprised at how quiet it was and how well we slept! We didn’t hear any noise whatsoever from any of our neighbours. The gym is a great addition, and although we came with all great intentions, “holiday mode” took over and we did not use it, but the equipment there was great. The wine happy hour between 5-6pm daily was also a lovely touch. A nice place to go for a drink or two before heading out for the evening. Also great to have a little snack area for guests to help themselves to - small touches but great to have. The hotel is in a great location too, far enough away from lots of noise and people but only a short walk to Grand Central, Times Square etc so found it really easy to get around the city from there. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again next time we’re back in New York. ","Eastleigh, United Kingdom",4,4.0

Originally I booked it for its proximity to Grand Central bc is Feb & we expect a snow storm (1 block away from its 44st exit) and for its fair room rate. Upon arrival, shocked & skeptical bc there is no lobby but a large foyer w a couple of Kiosks w a couple of smart looking fellas (good thing). Well, I was put to ease immediately when I was treated with super friendliness and kindness. Graig (Greg) was helpful and made my stay comfortable. He's like the everything go to guy, helped bring my luggages to my room (bc I hurt my shoulder) and my car bookings, and even lent an ear to hear me rant about my day. The room was modern & clean, with modern bathroom (most vital). Size is small like more NYC rooms and perfect for solo travellers. For couples, may be book a larger room. The roof top lounge is my favourite, its where guests hang out with all day complimentary snacks & beverages, use of computers, simple breakfasts, and free flow wine in the evening. The Wine-server guy (forgot his name) is so funny, he does a trivia every so often w give-away bottles. It brought the hotel and its residents a little closer.

We started our visit by stopping off at the hotel to drop our luggage at 9:30am, knowing that we could not check in until 3. The front desk staff was so accommodating. Surprised that there was no lobby, we asked if there was someplace to freshen up and change our clothes. This is when we discovered the hidden gem of this hotel. The bellman gave us access to the 27th floor lounge where we grabbed some coffee and snacks, used the restroom and regrouped. After a great afternoon at the parade, we arrived back at the hotel for a quick check in at a kiosk and friendly front desk staff who told us our luggage had already been placed in our room and there was a happy hour on the 27th floor from 5-6. Our room was clean, spacious (for NYC) and well appointed. After a quick shower we ventured to the 27 floor and were greeted by an extremely fun and festive atmosphere and our host CHRIS and his team. I am a jaded, former New Yorker and was not expecting to have so much fun at a hotel happy hour! Chris welcomed every new arrival with warmth and humor that immediately put everyone in the room at ease. After a rousing game of trivia that included everyone, we happily stayed behind and met people from around the world. It was St. Patrick’s Day in NYC and we opted to hang in a hotel lounge thanks to the fun atmosphere created by Chris and the rest of the crew.

There are 4 CQ Hotels in Manhattan and I chose Grand Central because of the price and location. I have to say the hotel stands for the quality of the brand, since this is a very neat hotel with a great location in Manhattan. It’s close to Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, the 5th and Times Square. The hotel is very clean. I got the basic room and I was surprised with the size, it is small but actually bigger than the standard hotel room in Manhattan. Bathroom was clean, shower was great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Be sure to check the Club Living Room and have a glass of wine for free on the happy hour, also some snacks and a great view of the city. The free water bottles, online check-in and key room on your mobile is a great plus.Overall, CQ Grand Central is one of the top choices to stay in Manhattan at a reasonable price for what you get.

Location is convenient to transportation, tourism, business and general access to many of Manhattan's highlights (Broadway Theater, Fifth Avenue shopping, UN, and Rockefeller Center to name a few). I would describe this hotel as business meets boutique. Rooms are well fitted with the basics, however, everything one can possibly need is accessible and comfortably laid out. Large televisions, comfortable beds, microwave and coffee maker, and in larger rooms a sofabed and small kitchenette.The key to CQ is their proximity to central locations in cities around the country.Some internationally. We have often been able to check in early if a room is available and staff will store luggage after check out should you want to stay in town. The bonus of this hotel is the lovely high floor lounge and enclosed, heated terrace with great views of midtown Manhattan. The lounge is outfitted with several computers and a printer, snacks including fruit and granola, and a high end coffeemaker - all complementary. There is a lovely happy hour with complementary wine, sodas, coffee and snacks. Today, we returned from our day out to be welcomed by Zishan, the Guest Service Manager. There was light jazz playing in the background and the atmosphere was calm and welcoming. As a long term patron of the CQ hotels, I have to say this was one of the more welcoming and relaxing visits I can remember. Thanks Zishan for your generous welcome.

The location is great -- it's just a couple of blocks from Grand Central and many sites are within an easy walking distance, including Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and the Empire State Building, depending on how much you like to walk in the city. Of course, there's a subway station at Grand Central, which is nearby. The staff were very friendly and helpful -- especially Jillian and Ashely at check in -- and our room was nice and comfortable, if on the small side. We especially liked the ""living room"" on the 27th floor, where you can get snacks, coffee & tea, still or bubbly water all day and free wine at 5. The view from up there is terrific. Minor complaints: The shower--it was one of those that has a very slight dip from the floor of the bathroom and is not separated from it at all. The drain doesn't do the job of t's keeping water from getting all over the floor and of course the floor mat gets soaked. I also wish they had recycling bins in the rooms.We would definitely stay here again.",Connecticut,38,5.0

I tried to sleep but couldn't because of the stench and had to switch rooms in the middle of the night.

Hotels in NY are expensive. It took me a few weeks to finally decide on one and we choose the Club Quarters Hotel at Grand Central. Location: We liked how this hotel is so close to the Grand Central station and hence it was easy to get around to most parts of NY. There's also many eateries nearby and the Grand Central station itself has bakeries and a food court. We could also walk to nearby attractions like Bryant Park and the NY Public Library. SAKS fifth ave and Rockefella Center would be about a 10-15 min walk away. Rooms: We travelled as a family of 4 and we were given the biggest room which was the one bedroom suite with kitchenette. It comes with a sofa bed, a small dining table with 2 chairs and a tiny kitchenette with a sink and a microwave. There is no stove in this type of room configuration. It was quite a tight squeeze for us but it was manageable. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping did a good job too. My only gripe was that the room on the 7th floor was noisy. Not only did the sirens from the police cars and fire trucks kept me away at night but the heater in the room as well. It was noisy and loud and it made me feel like I was staying in some crummy hotel. Other than that, service was good and the staff were all very polite and helpful. If you don't wish to splurge on expensive accommodation in NY, this would be a good choice. ","Singapore, Singapore",12,3.0

We originally booked this hotel when it was Hotel Boutique (or prior to Club Quarters taking Hotel Boutique over) so there was some confusion when the taxi dropped us off as noone had informed us but it was a great stay.Staff - all very friendly and helpful - they always checked that you were ok and wished you a great day/night, we had great recommendations for cars/taxis which saved us money! Room - this was spacious for a New York room and given we were only on the 10th floor it was very quiet and we slept really well. We were also located quite near the lifts but were not disturbed at all by them or any guests. Hotel - location is great and right in the middle of Manhattan making most tourist attractions within easy walking distance, it is also located close to Grand Central so getting the subway is easy. So many food options surround the hotel too. The hotel adds great value for money with the free wine and drinks every day along with free soft drinks and snacks all day, use of computers and printers and a lounge/balcony area with views of the Chrysler Building. For a small gym room it had a good mix of equipment meaning you could get a good workout in and quite a few people could fit in all at once.Overall, we had a really great stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone coming to New York.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",28,5.0

A large flatscreen with a decent enough range of channels. Plus a happening happy hour from 5-6pm every day with free wine (a solid, dry white wine from the North Fork included) and snacks (SO yummy granola) and fruit (apples, oranges, pears). But then there are the cons: the lack of a room minifridge is SO ANNOYING. You can leave food with the reception to put in the staff fridge but it’s really trying to have to ask for it each day or night. There’s plenty of room in the room for such a minifridge. The WiFi is also not great: it cuts out here and there and at times made it hard to work in the room. Finally the staff made made me grit my teeth sometimes. I guess they’re trying to be hip and cool but it came across as unprofessional at times: with their jaunty behavior, playing hacky sack in the lobby and the braying guy giving out wine.

It would be great if at least a couple of additional towels were stocked automatically. We had 2 bath towels, we were 2 guests, and when I asked for 2 extra they were quickly delivered. I left a note the next morning to please leave us an extra and housekeeping did. On our last night, the tv would not turn off. A tech came up and looked at it, touched something, and the tv went off. In a few minutes, the tv came on again on it's own, and we called back. The tech came up, pulled out the wires and just totally unplugged it so we could get to sleep. We did make sure upon check out that the staff knew that the cables were out because there was an issue. We had a late flight so we hung out in the lounge area until it was time to leave.

Bathroom was roomy and very clean. An added bonus of Club Quarter hotels is there living room and terrace on the top floor. You can grab tea coffee and cold sodas here at any time plus snacks and fruit. Its pleasant to sit out on the terrace and watch the world go by too.

Arriving:When I arrived, my friend who had booked the room had a late flight so I couldn't check in. The staff at the desk were kind to keep safe my bags for me and invited me to stay in the lounge to wait for my friend. I was very tired and it was quite late but everything was made better by the amazing view in the lounge, and the free snacks and drinks. I met Elizabeth, who was working at the lounge. She was incredibly kind, funny and answered all my questions, recommending great places to go to during my stay. She is a hoot and brings a smile to a weary travelers face! She goes the extra mile for her guests at the hotel! Problem solving:Whenever there was a problem during the stay, the staff members were always attentive and on your side to find a solution. Melissa and Mallory were especially helpful (and that helpfulness extended even after I had checked out!)Happy hour:Drinking wine with a dazzling view makes everyone feel glamorous. David at the happy hour was entertaining and kind, clearly someone everybody likes! The wine was amazing (and free, OMG!)Room:The room was clean and an amazing view from the 23rd floor of the Chrysler building! Shower has a good pressure and the air-con worked fine.Elevators: As its quite a popular hotel, of course there's going to be a bit of traffic with the elevators, but you kind of figure out when everybody is leaving at the same time and I often waited to go a little bit later or earlier. Also, I just want to mention that every single member of staff that I met at the elevators always said Hello and goodbye or good morning or good night.

This is written from a perspective from someone who hasn’t been to NYC since 1998. I mainly travel for leisure. Visited with my husband. Check in: Came in at about 2:15 PM on a Thursday, was able to check in early. Accommodating and nice. Chris greeted us at the door and he was awesome and friendly!Room: Fairly quiet, was able to sleep well with very little sound from the street (view faced Lexington Ave and E 45th street). I was on 7th floor and view was fair. Walls seemed solid for soundproofing. Had a Keurig machine. Bed: Comfortable, pillows were soft, and they only provided two for the queen bed so we called the front desk and asked for 2 more and they brought them up right away. There’s also a blanket in the closet that is one of the softest blankets I’ve ever felt, which made it more comfortable.TV: Worked well, channels were plentiful. Air conditioning: Works fast, was able to be comfortable in the room. Bathroom: When we checked in, the staff asked if we were ok to be changed to a “handicapped accessible” room, has an accessible shower, and stated it was “bigger.” We both did not have physical disabilities, and we thought the room was fine. The shower had a chair that could be folded up, and we kept it up. Water was hot. Water pressure was fair. Had a sliding “barn” style door, which was adequate to keep sound down. There was a fan in there, but there was no way to turn it on. I’m not sure if there was one at one point, but it gets foggy when there’s hot showers.Amenities: WINE O CLOCK!! Free wine at 5 PM Everyday! Complementary water bottles on each floor with cold water – this was nice so I can have water as I was in and out all day. Snacks available throughout the day on the 27th floor. Breakfast had a big coffee/espresso/cappuccino/late machine (only one for the bar), bananas, apples. Also had Pepsi products in cans. Snacks included granola, M&Ms, pepper crisp crackers.Davio’s, which is an Italian restaurant in the basement of the hotel was decent! Ate here for two nights, one including before the marathon. When you tell the hostess your room number they charge it to your room and take 15% off. What they could do better: Provide a night light in the bathroom – I don’t like to turn on the light when I have to get up in the middle of the night. This was minor, but something I could’ve liked. This is an AWESOME location for a hotel in NYC and we loved staying here. Thanks for making my trip an amazing one!",,6,5.0

The 11th-floor room was small but comfortable with a good bed, decent storage space and a good-size counter with chair that served me as a work area. The remote for the flat-screen TV was the easiest to operate of any I have used worldwide. Housekeeping kept the small bathroom (shower only) and bedroom absolutely immaculate. Lighting was excellent. The A/C, however, was terribly loud, and I really missed not having a safe. I got frustrated with the unreliability of the WiFi. Each floor has a free water-to-go station with empty bottles that can be filled with chilled water. There is also a guest closet in the corridor with items that are often needed. For example, I made good use of one of the ironing boards and an iron.The lobby is not traditional. It is a small space with two computer stations and a bench that can likely accommodate three people. A staff person, however, is always here. Guests can check in and out by computer or with staff. Three elevators make up the back wall.I interacted with several staff members throughout my stay. All were upbeat, friendly and helpful. They gave reliable answers quickly to any question that I asked. For those who want a hotel with a place to relax, the hotel has a huge room with an outside terrace on the 27th floor. The view from there is amazing day and night. It has a small business section with computers and printer and snacks and drinks are always available. A Happy Hour occurs daily from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.I consider the hotel to have location, location, location.

When we called to get some cutlery, all that we got was some cheap takeout plastic that was unsuitable for cutting the bread and bagels we purchased from the Grand Central Market.

It is a typical basic hotel located near Grand Central Station in New York, but is certainly not a boutique hotel. Rooms are small, basic and clean. However the air coditioner is old and very noisy, the water pressure from the shower is very poor, the furniture is dated (the seat had cracks in the upholstery) and the bed dipped down in the middle. The check in area is a small elevator lobby with no seating and three mobile podiums and there is no obvious Hotel Boutique name branding on the entrance, which makes finding this hotel difficult for new visitors.

This is where the guest service manager (Rey) came in to rectify the problem. He went out of his way and upgraded us to a full-size suite at no extra charge. He even went further and gave my family full breakfast vouchers for our 3 day stay. Another staff member (Chris) also went out of his way to help use have a wonderful stay at the hotel. He used his contacts to get reservations to various fine restaurants of our choice. He is also responsible for the happy hour between 5 to 6pm. Lot's of free wine and snacks to allow guests of the hotel to mingle. Great job Chris! I also discovered that he is a great and upcoming artist. I suggest you check that out.

Where to start?Firstly great location, next to grand central station, restaurants and bars in and around hotel.For the price we paid compared to our last stay in a different hotel, the room was great value. Clean, good view, air con, great tv with Netflix. Descent size.Now the amazing stuff; firstly the staff were all amazing but especially Zishan who offered us a room upgrade if we weren’t happy (but we were), give me the best location to drop the question to the misses and a great restaurant to go to after, he was a big help to making our day special. Chris gave a great first impression of the hotel the second we walked through the door, was funny and made the little one feel special.The hotel kept on giving part of stopping at the hotel enabled us to use happy hour between 5-6 with free wine and cans of pop, other bar type snacks. Coffee all day, fresh water machines on each floor with bottles to re-fill. Saved us a lot of money.Secondly the roof top terrace had a great view and was clean but best part was u could take ur own food and drinks up there. Again saved us a lot of money rather than paying loads at roof top bars we could buy our own refreshments and enjoy the view in piece and quiet.The value for money is great and I would recommend anyone to this hotel. Yes there will be better hotels in New York but u would be paying stupid money, when you can get what we had for the price we paid I know what I’d choose. Keep up the good work.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",0,5.0

The bathrooms have only a stand in shower. This location of CQ has an excellent lounge on the top floor that also includes an outdoor space, I liked this feature a lot. The lounge is a great place to unwind.At my second stay i was able to check in around noon which helped me get a room on the 15 floor with a good north facing view.This was my second time staying at the CQ, and by then i was used to quirks: Some what slow or scarce elevators, and the fact that there is no ""lobby"" per se. This time around there were 2 employees to help guests check in and it was short and speedy. I tired to download the App on my mobile the day before to check in electronically but hit a snag.

We were originally looking for a hotel not in Manhattan but then decided to save on travelling time, and this was a very good decision. Very central location made getting around easy, and also we came back to the hotel to have a lie down or drop off shopping in between sightseeing and shopping. Being so close to Grand Central station, even getting to the subway was easy, to get to other parts of Manhattan further away. The staff is great, very helpful and ready to serve and accomodate guests. Chris, the showman of the place, making sure every guest goes unnoticed, and that everyone's glass is always full at happy hour on the roof terrace of the hotel, while you take pictures of the Chrysler building almost next door. Rey, Sandy and Jevness at front desk all ready to help us with anything we needed. Our first room had a bit of a problem with the A/C but when we mentioned it to them, they changed our room with no problems at all. Elizabeth from housekeeping making sure I was getting enough shopping done and keeping me up to date with where to find the best deals. All staff was friendly and helpful, and excellent at their jobs. The rooms were very comfortable, our first room had a refrigerator and microwave, our second did not, but we didn't really feel a need for them. I would think these are especially handy for people travelling with children. The laundry room was a great extra: 2 washer/driers for guest use at no extra cost, detergent included. The only (obvious) problem is that they're pretty much always in use, so a little stalking is needed to catch one in time to get your laundry done. A small fitness room can be found if you still have enough energy after all your walking.

Anyone reading this review with a view to considering where to stay in NY please be in no doubt that we would recommend this hotel highly. Very central yet within easy walking distance (if you like walking and we do) to many of the iconic symbols of New York - the Chrysler building, 7th Avenue, Times Square, St Patrick,s Cathedral, the Rock, the Central Library and so on. However if walking is not your thing well a hop, skip and a jump takes you to Grand Central Station and the subway will take you all over. Be sure to get a 7 day pass though and you can whizz up down, left and right as often as you like and can visit everything. Brilliant. Back to the hotel though. This is a very friendly, welcoming place where nothing is any bother to the staff therein. Furthermore the rooms are comfortable (as is the bed) and of a practical size. Good toilet/shower facilities and includes a goodly supply of toiletries. There is also a little sofa with a table in front and a supply of coffee, tea and uht milk along with a coffee maker. Television, WiFi and air conditioning completes the scene. The bonus to this venue is the lounge/terrace on floor 27. What a wonderful addition to one’s stay this turned out to be. Head up in the morning for copious amounts of coffee, tea, granola bars, bananas, apples, oranges. All free gratis. Now every evening, around 5.00 pm there was a complimentary wine reception ( red and rose), but also from the fridge could be had tins of soft drinks (I can’t remember what now which possibly tells you something!). Included were crisps and snaky things or nibbles - and very very popular this all proved to be to the guests in the hotel. We loved it. The hosts at these daily events were all lovely people (one in particular was quite a colourful character, and another one quietly charming). Regardless - they contributed and added value to the quality of our stay here.

You can basically walk to the uptown/midtown tourist attractions (rockefeller center, times square, bryant park etc.) Every floor had a water machine woth empty water bottles, you dont need to stack up with water from foodshops. At the rooftop is a lounge area, with coffee machine, sodas and snacks complementary by the hotel. And every day at 17 o clock was wine hour, where they served local wine, also for free. Really nice atmosphere, you could small talk with other quests or just enjoy the rooftop view. The hotel had no own breakfast area, but you can find many cafes and diners around the area. The rooms where small, like in every big city, but I've seen worse. Queen size bed, a small couch/table area, fridge and bathroom. The foodportions are big in th US, so the fridge came in handy when we wanted to take-a-way the rest of the meal from restaurant. Air conditioning was a bit loud, but it worked. No complain about the cleening, towels where changed daily. We got a room at the 17th floor, so heard no traffic noises. If you are travelling from Newark airport I would recommend to take the bus, newark airport express to bryant park and walk a couple of blocks from there. Had no complaint about the bus ride. The departure was at friday afternoon, we had reserved some extra time for the traffic so got to airport on time.

My family and I were tremendously surprised and pleased. First of all, it is very tough to find a hotel willing to accommodate a one night stay, especially a Saturday night. The folks at Club Quarters didn't seem to mind. The price was super fair in terms of NYC hotel room prices, especially for a last minute booking. Location is great; a five minute walk from Grand Central and close to a variety of subway stops. It was easy to hop around the city with this as your home base. Check-in and checkout were a snap and they had a room ready for our early check-in.The room itself was the usual small-ish NYC hotel room. One bed with a fold out sofa bed, which might be touch for an adult to use comfortably but our teenager had no issues. We were struck by how quiet it was considering the busy midtown bustle 15 floors below.And if that wasn't enough to make us happy, we discovered the terrace on the 27th floor (open 24 hours) with beautioful three direction views of Manhattan. And the clubhouse that is attached offers snacks, sodas, fruit, coffee, etc. gratis. That, along with the ice cold filtered water machines (with bottles for those on the run) on every floor, are very thoughtful small touches that really make a difference. Well done and we hope to return soon.","Milford, Connecticut",3,5.0

Chose this hotel mostly for location and value for the money. Room was on the 22nd floor and in a corner. The room was clean, and had one of the most high tech TV's we have ever had. Air Condition worked well but I wish that Housekeeping would not turn the system off completely when it is 94f outside for 3-4 days in a row. This left the room hot and required the unit to run late into the night.The guest amenity closet is a great concept but... I wish the hotel would stock it with more than just a Ironing board.Again no biggie just asked the desk for what we needed.Wine at 5 and good old David entertaining everyone was a hoot. And we are not just talking sampling wine but good old fashioned pre-Broadway entertainment.Now for the negative thing:-The Guest/Self Laundry- This is something that is a huge amenity if executed properly by a hotel but in this case this was done rather poorly. Mind you it is Free(including the Detergent), but do not count on this as part of your trip. While this was not the deciding factor in choosing this hotel(Value and Location were), it has been something that was a deciding factor in the past and we were counting on laundry being available. The laundry is a home grade all in one washer/Dryer machines. This means 110V drying which takes a very long time(5-6 hours easy). The hotel has 2 of these machines and when working if you can dry a few items in your room it probably wont be a issue. However, when guests put detergent powder in the liquid dispenser or into the drum or both and plug the machines... they don't work well. I would have rather seen a paid commercial laundry like at the Villa Fontaine Tamachi on our last trip that costs 3$/load to wash and dry(plus detergent) then a free set up that 1) you cant get to 2) doesn't work. It is great that it is there... if you can get to it and use it but with one machine broken and a 5-6 hour wash cycle, it was always in use.Choose this hotel as the value and location are second to none... but don't rely on the laundry if you have a extended vacation.",,3,5.0

We had not expected that. The room was clean and comfortable. There were a nice outdoor terrace and indoor lounge on the 27th floor, and these were comfortable and hospitable, although in NYC one does not usually choose a hotel for staying indoors, the views of the city at various hours of the day from that vantage point were fascinating.

This social room on the top floor is the jewel for the hotel. The views from its terrace are awesome. One downside is its tiny lobby – just one person standing behind a ‘bar’ without any chair.

The hotel is entered by a single door off the street giving access to a small lobby, not giving the best impression. However there were 3 staff members present, all were friendly and helpful. The booking in took only a couple of minutes and was a pleasurable experience. We were given 2 room key cards and took one of the 3 elevators up to the 9th floor. Our room (907) was small but had enough space for the 2 of us. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and looked as though it was newly renovated. It had a sliding door deprecating it from the sleeping area. There was no bath but the shower was of a good size. There were plenty of shampoos and conditioners given daily. The rest of the room was clean and had a small wardrobe and table and chair. There was a large tv on the wall facing the bed. Our room looked out over Lexington Avenue and as with most rooms that overlook streets you could hear the traffic (and sirens and horns) throughout the night. Although the weather was extremely hot, we did not need to use the air conditioning as the room remained cool. The hotel had a snacks and relaxation area on floor 27 which had an outside area with terrific views. The snacks are free (fruit, coffee, soda, fruit bars and M&M’s) as is access to computers. The hotel is in a good location just behind the Chrysler building and across the road from access into Grand Central Station.All in all I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel and based on this visit I would stay there again and recommend it to others.",,12,4.0

The lady that checked me in was very nice and polite. The room I was given faced the air conditioner units and brick walls; I asked to be moved to another room, but they did not have a room available. They said they would put me on a list to be moved since I was staying a couple of nights - never heard a word. Every evening, I would go around the corner from the hotel for a glass of wine (that I paid for) and during the day and in the mornings, I went to Starbucks for coffee and/or snacks (that I paid for)... My last evening at the hotel, I was chatting with a lady on the elevator and she said what a great hotel this was and I shook my head thinking... why? Then she proceeded to tell me that there was a great roof top terrace with wonderful views on the 27th floor, coffee and snacks 24 hrs, breakfast items in the mornings as well as a fabulous Happy Hour from 5 - 6 in which I was never told of. Instead of going to my room each evening; I would have sat outside and enjoyed NYC with everyone else at the hotel. I then went up to see what she was talking about and met Kevin. He was truly sorry that I had not been told of the extra's that the Club Quarters offered and he brought me a 'goody bag' to my room. He definitely exemplifies the true meaning of customer service, dedication and loyalty to the hotel chain and gets 110% in my book.

Seriously, it was like a cupboard and every few minutes you could hear and feel a train rumbling by as the room was directly above Grand Central. I was shocked that we would be down-graded (to this extent) without any explanation and were still expected to pay the luxury rate. Only after much protest and a few hours of waiting around did we get moved to a suite that was clean, quiet and comfortable but certainly not luxury. We were offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience.I found the whole experience quite unsettling and wanted to discuss my concerns with the hotel manager, who it turns out, was never available. We finally connected with the Guest Services Manager who was gracious and apologetic. She offered an adjustment to our rate, which was greatly appreciated. In looking through reviews it's disconcerting to see this has happened to other travellers. It's more typical to get upgraded at a hotel, rather than downgraded. It felt like they were trying to pull a fast one. It felt underhanded and unethical.As far as the hotel goes, it's a great location but that was the only real advantage. The room was showing its age, there wasn't a room safe and the elevators that did work were very slow.Bottom Line: Take a pass on this one.",Canada,36,2.0

Seems like there is little or no noise insulation on the windows. Perhaps a room away from the main street(s) would be advantageous.We took advantage of the free drinks and nibbles one night and the host that night kept all in the room amused, a nice touch.There is a restaurant in the basement and we believe this is not associated with the hotel, but they do recommend it. We tried breakfast the first morning, it was overpriced and underwhelming. There are many better options close by.Yes we do recommend, however if we come back to this hotel we would be careful with our request for a room away from the street noise.","Melbourne, Australia",124,4.0

Housekeeping took my pijamas on the 4th or 5th night probably by mistake when they changed the sheets. I told the receptionists multiple times ( probably all their reception people heard of it, I asked every day). Same response, we will look for them and return them to you. Same thing every day. When I started saying it’t not ok for me to sleep in my fitness clothes because they took my pijamas one of them actually made a joke that he would go to Marshalls and get a pair for me, all laughing. I did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude at all. My pijamas were nowhere to be found until the end of my stay. After I insisted that it is absolutely not ok and I should be compensated for them they took a day to get manager approval to reimburse me for the amount I showed them on Amazon for an almost identical pair. They said I would get the money back on my card. What do you think? No money ever returned...No interest in your customers plus bad jokes plus committing to something and not doing it after the customer left. Seriously?

To start, it's located about a 3-4 minute walk from Grand Central Station so you can pretty much get anywhere in the city via subway in no time. The hotel itself is just a few doors down from Lexington Ave. so the exterior of the hotel isn't that busy on a standard day. The lobby area is very small, but then again, it doesn't need to be big and grand because the guests who stay here just need a place to sleep while on business. The staff at the front were very helpful when I arrived and I'd highly recommend downloading the CQ app on your phone and checking in with that (you can even get an electronic room key) and you can avoid any waiting time and go right to your room. My room was the standard club room and it had a nice little sofa and table and a pretty sizeable bet, but wasn't that comfortable if I do say so myself. The shower pressure also wasn't great but the rest of the bathroom did the trick. I liked the TV set up in the room where you could connect to the room's wifi and stream Netflix or Hulu or even airplay from your device if you wanted. Really cool! I was on the 4th floor and didn't have a window at all, which didn't really bother me, but it would have been nice to see outside during my stay.As per the rest of the hotel, every day from 5-6pm there's a wine and cheese tasting on the gorgeous 27th floor lounge and terrace. The terrace is outside and has ample seating with views down what I think was 3rd Ave. as well as the Chrysler Building to the South. The lounge itself has snacks and beverages all complimentary at all times during the day and night. The gym is pretty small and on the 3rd floor but it's what you'd expect for a hotel gym. Like I said, the staff were awesome and definitely enhanced my stay here. I would 100% return, especially to this location, even though there are a few others around the city like Midtown, Times Square, opposite Rockefeller, and Wall St.","Toronto, Canada",28,5.0

We took the train in from CT, went to a NYY day game on Saturday, and then had sightseeing planned in Manhattan & Brooklyn on Sunday. Because of this, we wanted a hotel that was in a central/convenient location, and close to Grand Central as well as the subway. We also wanted a decent, comfortable room with modern amenities. Club Quarters ended up being the perfect choice for us. First off, it's got the ideal location of being right next to Grand Central as well as a subway station that took us up to the Bronx and down to Brooklyn. It's also very walkable to lots of restaurants, bars, and attractions nearby. Second, we loved the room itself - it was on the smaller side, but plenty of room for two people. It was clean and super modern, with a comfortable bed, plenty of outlets, and a nice shower. We also liked how our floor had a water machine with free water bottles that you can fill and take with you (I believe every floor had these, if I recall correctly). We also LOVED the free wine on the 27th floor lounge/sunroom from 5-6pm! Chris Q., one of the Club Quarters staff members, ran the wine hour - he was super friendly and enthusiastic, which made it extra fun (as did the unlimited refills).We would definitely stay at Club Quarters again next time we're in NYC, and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for NYC lodging as well!

When I told him that wasn't the case, he continued to show confusion asking for my credit card and ID as if I had reserved the room for a second stay. It never dawned on him that we could be two different people and he continued down this path. I showed my pique. Eventually he figured out that we were two different people with similar first names--though with male and female versions-- and the same last name, assigned to the same room.

We come to New York twice a year for trade shows, and this has become our go-to place to stay. The location by Grand Central Station is perfect to easily get anywhere in the city. The rooms are typical NYC where space is a premium, so efficient design is key. Upon request there are some rooms with two double beds, something not always obvious from the booking sites. The lobby, staffed with super helpful folks, is essentially non-existent, rather a place to check in and out, inquire about services and information, but not a place to linger. That is reserved for the top floor which has probably the best feature of the hotel. The living room is a comfortable place to meet, hang out, use the computers, grab a snack or coffee (complimentary), or enjoy the view from the terrace - which is winterized for the cold-weather months. A great view of the Chrysler building and other mid-town buildings reminds you from every angle that you are in the heart of things. Additional little things like water bottles and chilled water dispensers and a supply closet on each floor are great little features.

It's one of the best balances of being nice while not being unrealistically expensive. The room was better than other manhattan rooms I've had in the same price range. The biggest reason I will book again with CQ at this specific location is because of the staff. The first part of my stay, the staff working seemed inconvenienced and impatient. It really rubbed my the wrong way, but the reason I'm giving this place a 5/5 is because of Chris, Rey, Robert, and Khari. They were the team working on the afternoon of St. Patrick's day 2018 - which is when I was checking out - and they completely sold me on the place. These guys were perfect - they work together perfectly and are personable and know how to engage guests like I've honestly never seen before. If I started a hotel business, I'd hire these guys immediately. They talked to me, made me feel valued, and really completely sold me on CQ Grand Central. For this reason, I will definitely be going back. Hopefully everyone gets to meet these guys during their stay.

Then the total amount of invoice for my staying at the hotel was bigger than what was stated in the reservation. The receptionists could not explain to me why it was more expensive for THREE days each time promising to figure it out but never did. They only managed to do it on check out when i was one foot in the taxi to the airport.Then at the check in i gave my credit for deposit but asked the manager not to charge the card as i was going to use another card for final payment at check out. You know what, they did charged it despite my ask. I requested a refund at the check out and paid by a different card. I still did not get the refund confirmation! Although the receptionist Debbie promised to email this to me on 3rd jan. The last important thing (there were of course more minor unprofessionalism i would not mention here) is that i forgot my hairdryer in the room. Of course i wrote once i found it was left at the hotel (next day!), then i called to the reception several times but they don;t answer neither to emails or to my calls either transferring the calls to someone, or just hang up.this is the worst customer service i ever experienced in my entire life. and given it's Christmas time, it's even worse.

This hotel was a great experience in may ways. I'll try and keep it short. We arrived on Black Friday and left on the following Tuesday. That's a BIG WEEKEND in NYC. A crazy time to be there, but the staff was wonderful. The check in was quick and accurate, and all the desk managers--on all shifts--were helpful, knowledgable, and personable. The lobby isn't much, but who cares! Out those double automatic doors is the greatest city in the world!!!My room had a great view. It was small (its NYC), but it was comfortable and practical. A Queen bed, a small L-couch with a movable table, and a closet. The bathroom had its own door. It had all the necessities a traveler might expect: comfortable bed and pillows, a good HVAC system, great internet [though Sunday night and early Monday morning were jumpy], a good selection on the TV, Kuerig coffee maker, good shower, and great housekeeping service. There is digital key access to the rooms, along with the elevators, so security for my wife, daughter, and I was never an issue. We felt totally safe (btw--all over NYC, too.]It's all about location, location, location--the East Side is great. Lots of food options. I find it a bit quieter than the West Side. Especially if you come in from LaGuardia.They have a water cooler that dispenses filtered water--and they provide the bottle too! Awesome little perk.There is a 'living room' on the 27th floor with TV, business station, and refreshments, snacks [good ones, not cheapies], fruit, and even carbonated and still water on tap adjoined to a room with tables to work upon or hold small meetings, and comfortable chairs surrounding small foot tables for socializing. There is also a terrace to look over Lexington Ave to the North and South, and they were offering a free wine tasting everyday sponsored by a local vineyard from 5pm-6pm.Highly Recommended! ",,0,5.0

It's also refreshing to have outlets where you need them - everywhere! Check in/out is done in the small, sparse, but very appropriate lobby via kiosk or staff (the lobby is not always staffed, but that's never been an issue because of the kiosk). Room amenities include the standard soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and hair dryer. if you need an iron, there's a closet in the hallway for guests (what a great idea!).

It could hold about 4 outfits, so if you're two or more and staying for more than two days, you'll struggle with the closet space. The breakfast room is a nice space, has machine coffee (like the kind we have at work, which is awful). If you're a coffee drinker, head around the corner to Starbucks.

Very dark and dingy with a double bed pushed against a wall and only room for 1 bedside locker and one night light. The bathroom was an ok size but the shower had very little power and no matter how much I tried it leaked to the floor every time.

Very poor service for hotel guests and one of the main reasons I would not return to this hotel. This hotel was not cheap and on top of this we were not allowed to avail of an area which was advertised as being for hotel guests.

I decided to leave my room early and stay out late to allow more time for them to clean up my room.Unfortunately, after 14,15 hours on the street, I only returned to my room to find a huge fan inside my room, with the windows and door left WIDE OPEN. Yep I was shocked as hell. How can they leave my door unlocked? How can they open the window??? And of coz, the carpet was still soaked heavily. Finally they agreed to give me a new room at this time. But I was too busy checking my luggages and belongings to see if there were anything missing. I had to dry up a couple of the important documents - the papers were all humid. Thank you very much. I cannot believe this is actually happening in a four star hotel.

We arrived around 9.30am and even though the check in time is not until 3pm we were given passes to their lounge and open air balcony on the 27th floor. We could help ourselves to free tea/coffee and chilled water. After a coffee or two and taking multiple photos from the balcony we went out for a wander around the area. We returned around 12 noon and tried our luck and asked if they had any rooms ready. We were given a front room on the 7th floor. It was nice and big with views into the street. There was no fridge in the room but it did a have coffee maker with cream and sugar and if you needed an iron and board they were in a cupboard in the corridor for everyone to share. We could also get chilled water on each floor as well which saved a fortune when marching about NY in 28 degrees. After another great night in the city we had a lazy morning until check out at noon, again though when we explained we were not flying home until later in the day they let us keep passes for the lounge. We went across the road to a local deli for fresh made rolls and wandered off to the park for lunch and returned a few hours later and just sat on the balcony people watching until it was time to get a taxi to the airport.

Given the options available in terms of CQ hotels in Manhattan, we first called the CQ customer service for some help. We were initially thinking of staying in downtown Manhattan but it became clear that the area becomes very quiet at night whereas we wanted to be in a more lively environment. Amongst the midtown CQ hotels, Grand Central is the newest and has a terrace on the 27th floor facing the Chrysler. Choice made! Looking at the reviews on tripadvisor, we were a little concerned about the traffic noise at night and so we contacted directly Mr Renz using the email address he had left on his replies to customers' comments. Long story short, we were pampered with a room on the 19th floor with great views on Lexington Avenue. We were greated with a personal note from Mr Renz with his contact details in case of any problem. (Mr Renz also emailed us during our stay to make sure all was good but we were too busy enjoying our break and forgot to reply...)The room was new, clean and comfy as expected; the bathroom spotless. We had no issues in sleeping at night. The breakfast room (including complimentary fruit and snacks) on the 27th floor with access to the terrace was great.The reception staff was also very friendly and helpful; we missed breakfast at The Comfort Diner down the road, which was highly recommended.

The room was excellent and well furnished, only problem the room air con unit was so loud you couldnt have it on at night, and again the outside roof units vibrated so still no peace. The positive side was the Hotel was very central to everything, close to Grand Central, Chrysler Building and walking distance to Empire State.

I won't go into the bad experience because the hotel went out of its way to make amends. But this around, something seemed to have gone wrong with their management and service. First the pros - this is a preferred hotel for me because it is right next to my manhattan office. From a convenience perspective, this is great. Another pro is their 27th floor lounge. You have to go there to see what it is. They have an open balcony with breathtaking views of manhattan where you can sit and work, and sip coffee/tea. Now the cons - the standard rooms are tiny (even tiny is a euphemism, they are claustrophobic). I specifically requested for a paid upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite, which is pretty comfy. I used to be a regular with Midtown Courtyard (boy, do they have large rooms! I used to love that place). Now back to the club. When you are business traveler, you expect efficiency. Especially in a place like Manhattan. These guys messed up my laundry twice. Once, they were not taking the express laundry option, saying that they take last order at 10 AM whereas their laundry slip clearly has that option (I used that in my last trip too!). When I asked them to check, they came back and accepted it. Next up, the laundry was messed up. Shirts were not properly ironed. What was requested to be boxed was put on hangers. Undergarments, instead, were boxed! Shirts were not properly ironed (Double cuffs were crumpled and not folded and ironed). When I raised the issue, they blamed their vendor. My take was ""I dont care for your vendor. I gave YOU my laundry. It is YOUR responsibility to maintain basic level of service"". The same thing happened next time I opted to send clothes for laundry. Moreover, the front desk kept refusing to pick up laundry and kept asking me to bring it down. That was when I told them I had a lot of laundry and needed help in bringing it down. I stopped using them for laundry service thereafter. When you are traveling for over 3 weeks on business, laundry is a key factor. If your suit or shirt is messed up, you are screwed. And I do not want this hassle while traveling on business or otherwise. Hence, I am not staying with them again. Twice burnt.","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",25,2.0

Very convenient location. As one does not usually spend a lot of time in a hotel room while in the city the rooms are small, very small. Very compact. Not much space for clothes etc. No place to store your suitcases. Very strange banquet seating with a sliding table. Not sure what that was about it was impossible to use. Not sure what their thoughts were. The bathroom is again very small not much room for your toiletries. The shower was Great, however. Rain shower type faucet and as it was not a tub you didn't have to climb in. Pocket door to separate from the room. Electrical outlets on one side of bed and nothing on the other. Perhaps they only have singles stay at the hotel but when will hotels learn to put plugs on each side of the bed. We all travel with at least one and usually two devices per person. This was frustrating. I mean how hard can that be I wonder. Nice staff and wonderful roof top terrace with a coffee machine and snacks all day. Lounge areas but the furniture was modern and not what I would call comfortable inside. Outside was comfortable and great views. Free Spring water dispenser on each floor. Free wifi.

The staff was so nice and helpful from check in to check out. The parking garage had a fire so my car was stuck in there and club quarters was so accommodating in helping me stay another night, they honored my previous night rate (since i had not planned on staying a 3rd night but had no choice, this led to a saturday night stay which typically costs more) They got us a room for that third night and helped ease my stress. They also were so helpful with bringing up sleep better kits and a humidifier to the room. Everything I called for was at my door immediately including help with my bags. The next day my car still was not able to get out and the front desk offered to let me stay in the room until 3 this was so so appreciated since i was essentially trapped and could not go too far since my bags were at the hotel. Overall, the kindness and professionalism that was shown was excellent. The Club Quarters staff truly knows the definition of hospitality and I was beyond impressed sometimes little things can turn an annoying situation (my car) to being ok, and thats what they did. They did all they could on their end to make the whole scenario easier and it is very very appreciated, so thank you to the day crew and the night crew for getting me checked in, helping me with my bags, bringing me my sleep better kits at night and making my overall stay a great one.

The heating/cooling system did not work properly and when someone came to look at it, he said that it was fine, by which he meant that you could put it on all the time, on low. But the ""auto"" function did not work, and it gave off a rumble of about 50 decibles, louder than a dishwasher.

The strong point is its price and location. Given its Grand Central location, you are easily in reach of anywhere in the city. Given the price, it is expected that there are aspects you can't expect. For one there is simply no real lobby. But to make up for this, there is a wonderful lounge on the top floor with ample comfortable chairs, flat screen TVs, computers and the New York Times. Free coffee, tea, and sparkling water are always available. Plus Monday - Thursday there are free snacks as well. This then is a terrific place to relax when not out on the town. Rooms are compact, but this is no surprise in New York unless you have money to spare. But the layout of the rooms keep them comfortable. Plus those dining at the associated Italian Restaurant are entitled to a 15% discount. (I didn't dine there so can't comment on the quality.) Each floor also has a place offering bottles which can be filled with cold water. In fact my only real objection was the antiseptic smell when I first entered the room, a smell that dissipated after the initial hour or two.

We only got 2 bath towels, 1 hand towel, and 1 washcloth for 2 people. I'm not a towel hoarder, but felt limited. The next days no washcloth at all, good thing I had brought one from home.

I have always found them to be perfect in every way -- definitely 5-star hotels. This particular facility, however, while wonderful in other ways, has several room sizes including 2 ""categories"" that are very small, so I was surprised and disappointed at the size of the room I had; it was barely large enough for me, alone, and was glad my husband was not with me because it would have been impossible for two people to be comfortable in it, despite the queen size bed (which, was very comfortable). I called the front desk to see if there was another larger room available, and was told they were sold out (I was also informed that my room was NOT the smallest, that there were also smaller rooms) but to their credit, they were willing to help move me the next day to a larger room (which I declined since I find moving more inconvenient than dealing with the small size). On the positive side, however, every member of the staff--housekeeping, front desk, ""engineering"" (who brought a mini-refrigerator to the room for my medications) -- were WONDERFUL in terms of attitude, professionalism, and competence. The restaurant was also quite good, with attentive wait staff, quality of the food, and very good value. I also love the complimentary ""purified"" water available on every floor, where you can fill up as many bottles as you want! I would definitely return to this hotel, especially if my favorite Club Quarters hotel (opposite Rockefeller Center) isn't available, and hopefully the next time I'll get a larger room!

I had left it in the hotel lobby ""hold area"", after checking out of the hotel. The hotel had agreed to hold the luggage while I found a restaurant, and had breakfast, and then picked up my car from a nearby parking garage, before leaving the city. Upon leaving the city and arriving at my destination in Montreal, I realized I had forgotten to return to the hotel for my checked luggage. Disaster! Thank god for Michelle, who came to my rescue when I phoned the hotel, and she advised me on contacting Fed Ex. for the addressing label and payment logistics. She then found an appropriate box in the hotel to package my luggage, and then took its contents to the Fed Ex store nearest the hotel to complete all necessary procedures. It was a potential major disaster, made entirely manageable by her most professional, and generous intervention. She served my need, and the hotel's good name, in a most satisfyingly friendly demeanor. Club Quarters is my ""go to"" hotel of choice, on all my future trips to N.Y..

As a word of caution, the wardrobe is small (only 8 hangers), there are no drawers in the room therefore very small storage space. The bathroom has only a shower, which is what I prefer (no need to waste space for a batch tub that is hardly ever used). Did not try the restaurant, has there are many viable choices just around the corner and in front of it! On the negative side : when I got to the lounge one morning there was no coffee; the printer was not working and they told me to wait for maintenance to arrive, after 30 minutes of patiently waiting, I left!

Managed to get rooms on the same floor. Arrived during a heatwave & thankfully the rooms have AC. Rooms modern & clean & we didn't hear our neighbours. Street noise as expected, but didn't disturb us too much. There is a fitness suite which we didn't use, but there is a rooftop terrace and indoor lounge which are lovely and definitely the highlight. My only complaint was on the Friday there were complimentary sodas & snacks, but these aren't available over the weekend, which would have been very much welcomed, especially after waking around in 35 degree heat all day! It's a nice extra touch, just disappointed that you are penalised for staying at the weekend. The coffee machine also broke & wasn't fixed until the Monday. Water and ice were available and we just ended up bringing back our own drinks and snacks. We extended our check out time to 3pm as we had an evening flight for $50 plus tax & just shared a room for this to keep our bags there during the day & have showers to freshen up before heading to the airport which was great.

I checked in after 11pm and didn't have the energy to argue, but I highly recommend that you request to switch. The 3rd floor has communal services like ice machines and the gym, so it's always noisy. The doors don't extend all the way down to the floor, so the noise easily sneaks into the room - as does the light. You will also hear street noise! Do yourself a favor and move to a higher floor. There always seemed to be one elevator out of order, so expect to wait on your way out or in. While the staff was pleasant, I had to ask 4 times to have the TV fixed, which is 3 times too many.

The rooftop garden and business center are terrific. The purified water is another big plus. Didn't try the fitness center so can't comment on that.I would stay here again, certainly.My only comment is that this time I had a rental car and needed to park it, when I finally got to the hotel (traffic of course being thick) I couldn't see a place to pull in, or park. I was told that I needed to go back and park in one of the lots a block away, since it's a one-way street this required more than a few attempts by me to get there.So knowing this would have saved me some hassle. The larger hotels have valets who just whisk your car away and this is what I thought would be the case, but Club Quarters is smaller and doesn't have that.

Had great view on the surrounding building's roofs and on the avenue downstairs from my room on 20th floor. The views are even more beautiful from the 27th floor lounge area which also has open balcony which was so pleasant to experience. Room itself was on a smaller side, size wise, but thus is to be expected in most of hotels in Manhattan. Everything in room/bathroom was well appointed, clean and functional. Lots of light and great views!

Silly to give this to anyone on a first visit to any property, because of it I would think twice. We all know about first impressions. I have booked colleagues into these properties before and they have all been happy, which is why I tried one myself ahead of booking 8 room nights in NYC in June. Room is spotlessly clean, lovely bedding, functional, clean bathroom, shaving mirror at usable height for a change, although I do have to move round in the shower to get wet, but that is common in so many other hotels today and I should lose weight anyway.

The view from the room wasn't excellent however the balcony on floor 27 definitely made up for this. We only ventured up there on the last couple of days and we really wish we had gone up earlier. It is such a peaceful little space with excellent views of Lexington allowing you to watch the world go by. It was also a nice little sun trap late in the day when you just want break.The area is excellent, it is close to Timessquare and Fifth avenue without being too noisy / busy at the hotel (about 5/10 minute walk) to these places. In addition to get to those places slightly further out the subway link is within Grandcentral so you can get about very easily.I think what makes this hotel stand out compared to others is that I really felt the Staff cared about how they make the Guests feel. The staff always asked how you where and if you asked a question they where always willing to help, although only small things it definitely makes you feel more welcome, and I think all of the Staff are a credit to the hotel.When we come back to New York next we will definitely look at booking this hotel again.","Silsden, United Kingdom",0,5.0

The highlight is the terrace with overlooks Lexington Avenue in the 27th floor, it is a great place to relax with a coffee. There are also meeting rooms in the second floor. they have obviously tried to keep expenses low and to provide only basic services that business travelers want, without the luxuries. The only downsides: the low floor rooms are noisy because you can hear the street ( it is NYC after all). Te trade off is that those rooms are larger than the upper floors, I suggest that they invest in safes in the room: it is a pain to have to go to the second floor to store your valuables, and that they also provide nicer towels ( the ones on the room are a bit rough). A plus would be if they would offer some breakfast items in the top floor, and some wine during happy hour, as many ohter NY hotels do ( for example, the one at 48 & Lex) .

Long story short, I was given a free upgrade for my troubles - from a basic room to a suite! The customer service is amazing and the rooms are clean!! This is coming from someone who is crazy about being clean and neat so even though this isn't a Hilton or Sheraton, you can feel at ease when making reservations here. Also, parking is on E. 45th St (just a few blocks down) and since you are a guest at the hotel the rate drops to $28/24 hr!!! The average rate is $60/24hr! HUGE savings! Thing is, to keep the rate at $28 you can't take your car out and check it back in. BUT, no big deal since Grand Central is around the corner!

The 27th floor lounge is very comfortable - a great place to get work done or read the paper. The staff is friendly.However, I was in a room facing Lex Ave. on the 7th floor. While the room itself was as nice as any CQ room I have stayed in, it was impossible to sleep due to the street noise from Lexington Avenue. Cab horns, trucks going in and ot of the post office across the street and thin glass windows make the room super noisy all night long.They need to better insulate the windows and add thick curtains to absorb at least some of this noise. It doesn't have to be this way. I've stayed in other hotels nearby on Lexington Avenue and slept just fine.I don't know if this problem can be fixed and its a shame because otherwise this is a great property. But sleeping is the whole point of a hotel and if they can't get that right, forget about the rest.",Los Angeles,184,2.0

Our first 2 days we clocked 25,000 steps (roughly 12 miles on foot with some metro). Day 3 we did 45,500 steps (roughly 20 miles on foot). We did Bryant Park, the entire Central Park Loop, the giant church 3 ish blocks away from Central Park in Harlem, 5th Avenue shops, Greenwich Village, One World Center, Empire State Building, Flatiron building, The Met, Grand Central Station, Times Sq, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Cathedral of St John the Devine. Anyway we did this from Fri afternoon to Sunday evening. My point is, it's a great location. The only thing we metro' to was One World Center and Greenwich then back uptown.

My room was on the 15th floor - very little street noise on Lexington Avenue, clean and spacious for Manhatten. This is not a luxury hotel, but the amenities are awesome. The room was modern and well appointed with a nice sitting/work space. The bathroom was modern and clean with good water pressure, nice towels and quality toiletries. The hotel has a beautiful indoor and outdoor space on the 27th floor with comfortable places to entertain, work on their McIntosh desktop computers, or enjoy the view of Grand Central Station and Lexington Avenue. According to staff they have food in this area during the week. The gym/fitness room is small, but has quality cardio and weight equipment. If you need a larger fitness facility ask for a day pass to the NewYork Sports Club next door. The location of Club Central is across the street from Grand Central Terminal (train travel). There are several excellent restaurants within a couple of city blocks and lots of small quick/counter top eateries. Check out 3rd or 2nd Ave for a large variety of places to eat. Across the street in Grand Central Station there is a large food court with several of NYC's famous walk-up eateries represented. There is a Starbucks across the street. Take a short walk to almost anywhere in mid-town, catch the subway 3 blocks up or there are thousands of taxis cruising down Lexington Blvd. Parking is two blocks from the hotel and runs about $45/day. My first visit to this hotel in February 2015 was a disaster. There was a very rowdy party going on right outside my door well into the early morning hours. I do not recommend staying in the handicapped accessible room if you can help it. The room is a decent size, but the location on the second floor next to the lobby and elevator make for a very noisy visit.We met several airline employees, businessmen/women and several couples.

The floor had a guest amenity closet with irons and ironing boards, extra pillows, extra soap, coffee pods, sewing kits, shower caps. The 3rd floor had the ice machine and 2 laundry wash/dry machines, with soap, free for guest use. Each floor had the water dispensing machines and empty bottles to fill. Loved the guest lounge on the 27th floor, work days they have fresh fruit, Granola bars, pop for guests. There are 3 Mac computers with 1 network printer to use, and there is a coffee machine that also did Lattes and Capucinos 24/7. The bonus is the terrace with tables and chairs with the fantastic city view, great place to have a drink to wind down, or watch the city go to work while having a coffee. What annoyed me had nothing to do with the hotel, but with guests taking advantage of the hotel, people leaving all their garbage around the guest lounge, grabbing more than their share of the food, not returning the irons to the closet for others to use, taking the newspapers out of the lounge to their rooms. My only beef with the hotel is that on the long weekend, one of the elevators was out of service the whole time, and at times, only one elevator was available for guests, while the other was being used by staff for cleaning carts etc, had a few long waits, hopefully this doesn't occur all the time.

The room we were assigned was designated ""Superior"" (with a ""kitchenette"") as it could (and did) accommodate three adults. The location was excellent: it was walking-distance close to several attractions of NYC, including the Rockefeller Centre,the Times Square, and Fifth Avenue shopping, among other others. We were pleased with the hotel facilities, too: our room was comfortable and clean; the housekeeping staff was on-time, efficient, and was quick to respond to our requests for extra towels and bed linens etc. And though the hotel is at the intersection of the always-bustling Lexington Avenue and East 45th. Street, the room we stayed in was quiet. We found the terrace on the 27th floor of the hotel to be an added attraction--it offered an impressive view of New York skyline, and was a lovely place to sit, relax, and enjoy the various kinds of coffee the hotel had for its guests 24/7, and fruits and snacks, too. For us, the terrace was a pleasant ""retreat"" after a busy day in the City, and which added value to our stay at the hotel. We also liked the fact that there was complimentary chilled water in bottles available on every floor, and a small laundromat with (detergent) for the guests' use--and ""on the house,"" too. But what made our stay particularly pleasant was the overall friendliness of the staff, and here we would like to single out Mr. Jean-Claude, the Guest Services Manager. Manning the front-desk, he was poised, patient, courteous, efficiently and effortlessly multitasking, and enormously helpful. To my mind, he is an asset to the management and the hotel. I wish more hotels had individuals like him interacting with and helping guests. We have two suggestions for the management: first, to make the terrace a smoke-free place, as is the rest of the property, and, second, somehow try to persuade the guests who use the ""living room"" adjoining the (open) terrace not to walk away with the newspapers, which, of course, is something easier said than done.

Also with car rentals and such.....). I saw this hotel on Hotels.com today for $354/night! :-O So unworthy of such a high rate.I had the worst night sleep ever. The room had a weird smell of Fabreze (or something similar) no doubt left behind by housekeeping. It was disgusting. But I don't like overpowering, chemical-like smells. Although I was above the 15th floor, the street noise was pretty bad. I heard incessant beeping throughout the night (work trucks reversing??) which drove me insane. The pillows were too plump (possible suggestion, add two pillows that are flat to the bed or put them in the closet!). The grey-ish hues chosen in the room really irked me too. The room seemed dingy in some way (it wasn't really but it seemed a bit....).I ran into housekeeping in the elevator/s 3 times during my one night stay. Listen, I'm no snoot, but do I have to stand next to the stinking bucket/s??? Jeeeees. Never mind that the elevators are SLOW. Also, one thing I ALWAYS look forward to when I stay at a hotel is a BATHTUB in which to soak. Only showers here, at least in my room. I revisited the hotel online and that was not mentioned in the description on any website! I was not happy. So I showered and went to plug in the dryer to blow dry my hair (I was in a rush) and the cord attaching dryer to wall outlet was like a foot long!!!! C'mon - who is going to steal a hotel dryer??? SO I dried my hair bent over....On the up side, they have an open terrace on 27th floor. Inside, you can make coffee and tea. There are 2 desktop computers. You can read newspapers. The gentleman in the lobby, Justin, was quite friendly and eager to help. We were early (approx 1300hrs) and he checked us in early (we didn't even have to ask). Check-in is 3PM. The location is good if you need to be near Grand Central - the express #4 & #5 subways are inside as is the local #6. You can walk to many places and attractions, the MoMA too.I highly recommend the restaurant downstairs which is called Davio's. Great service (sit with ""Kim"") and great food. But that is a different review.Also, I must mention that I forgot something in the closet (got no call about my item although hotel presumably has your contact info!). However, after a month of back and forth, I finally got a gentleman in lost and found who expedited my item to me (via FedEx and no expense to me).

I stayed here when I was in NYC on business. My office was just 3 blocks from here and we have a corporate tie-up with the place. I stayed here for 4 week nights, in a Standard Room’ on the 14th floor, in the West wing, so my room was facing Lexington Ave. Despite being a compact room it offered ample space to move around and all the amenities a lone business traveler might need. I LIKED – That they are located 10 to 15 mins walking distance from Rockefeller/ Empire State/ Time Square/ etc… and Grand Central is 2 mins walk for when you need to take the subway or a train out of the city. That room was very well maintained and the staff was polite and helpful. The cleanliness was top notch. The bathroom was spotless and well laid out. The table and couch arrangement in the room, at first looked like it will be difficult to get around, but soon I realized that the table slides about making it easy getting in and out of the couch. The arrangement by itself proved very handy from a 'work from the room' perspective. You get a fairly large table to plant your laptop, phone, chargers, etc. on and work comfortably and the tea maker that also occupies the same space. The table also has some power connections built in that only add to the convenience.They have an ice and water dispenser (with bottles available as well) in the corridor on each floor. Again very convenient. The free WiFi connected easily and worked very well. So again from a work perspective it’s quite dependable.The Private Club Living Room on the topmost floor is a nice place to sit and work at as well. I did that some mornings and the place has a nice vibe… its spacious with very nice views of the outside. There are some decent restaurants around here, and some have a tie up with the hotel so they deliver to the room. So the one day I worked from my room, I didn’t need to step out just to grab lunch. The staff are very helpful in guiding you to the right places depending on the cuisine you're in the mood for. The Italian restaurant Davio’s within their building facility is awesome for steak! I really have nothing to include that I didn't like about this place!","Pune, India",57,5.0

Our concern was temporary, because the ""chair"" bed, was amazingly, surprisingly comfortable (see photos). No bar in the middle of your back, et c. Never squabbled over the queen bed because the pull-out was just fine. Even with the chair bed pulled out, there was still plenty of space in the room. We never had to fold it back in so we could walk around. This chair bed seemed narrower than a twin, fyi. Other things to mention that might not have already been covered in other reviews...Yes, location of hotel can't be beat. Yes, very clean! But the other things that we loved about our room, it had:-- good shower pressure-- some amenities provided - small shampoo, conditioner and soap (see photo)-- a complimentary coffee machine AND microwave. -- a QUIET, heating/air conditioning system-- plenty of USB plug-in stationsOther hotel perks:-- Down the hall is cold, fresh, self-serve filtered water. -- Private club living room was spacious, well decorated and comfortable with a high-end, free coffee machine for use. Cappuccino anyone? Minor CONS:-- There's essentially only one person at their hotel desk...and each time I saw that person, they were always juggling more than one thing, with more than one or two hotel guests waiting for them. They could stand to use another person to help.-- We arrived well before check-in time. After waiting our turn for assistance to check in our luggage at the desk, we found our luggage still sitting on the floor in the lobby later that night. Same thing happened when we checked out.

The location is about a 10 minute walk to the Times Square, and two minutes to Grand Central. There are several cafes close by if needed. The rooms were nice, but can be small. We had the smallest room initially for two people but they made great use of the space and even had a small chair and table to use. We later upgraded to a suite for 3 of us. We were told there was a pullout couch but it was just a separate room with a mini kitchen and two extra chairs. The first night in the suite we were unable to get a cot or pillow because they were and had to have someone sleep on the floor, but they tried to help by sending multiple soft blankets and sheets. The second night they got us a cot and pillow. The bedroom window in the suite had a huge wall to wall window which gave for an awesome view. The staff were all very friendly and tried to help whenever they could. They even offered to get my mom some soup and tissues when she had a cold. There is an upstairs room available to guests with a coffee maker and a tv and chairs that was wonderful. They even have light snacks there sometimes too. Connected is also an outside area. I found the top floor to be the best part of the hotel. FYI, there is no lobby, just a desk for the worker. I would recommend this hotel to others and would stay again.","Stockton, California",26,4.0

All I really needed was an efficient, clean, well located and quiet place to stay and I got exactly that. This hotel really deserves a 4, but they failed at a couple basic aspects: I left one bag at the front desk the morning I checked out. It took the staff 15 minutes to get it back later that day, and I was the only guest keeping them busy. Why getting a bag out of a closet could possibly take so long is beyond me. Other than that it was all good. I wish the room had an iron and board, something a business traveler usually expects in a hotel like this. I'm sure I could've asked for one, but it would've probably taken quite a while. If you're self-sufficient and don't need to ask anything from the staff is place is perfect.

Requests - rollaway bed, extra towels - were met immediately. The room was really like a small very stylish, contemporary NYC apartment with a combination sitting and kitchen area, shower/toilet room with separate vanity area, and separate bedroom. All furnishings and materials were tasteful and of very good quality. I have never seen such efficient use of space in a hotel! In a relatively small footprint, everything was cleverly designed and arranged for maximum efficiency and attractiveness, making the space flow and seem larger than it really is. Three women with several shopping bags had plenty of room for an overnight stay! Our room was extremely clean and in excellent condition, as were the other areas we used - rooftop lounge, terrace, lobby and sitting area. There were many much appreciated extra touches in our room to help make our stay go smoothly such as free wi-if, two closets, fully stocked kitchenette, great lighting, small table/desk and chairs for two people with charging station, two flat screen tvs, etc. The hotel also provides complimentary water bottle filling stations on each floor.

Running around it is a wraparound deck with seating and great views of the Helmsley building, the Metlife and other NY icons. Every night I was out there enjoying a bottle of wine watching the lighted buildings of New York. The Helmsley in particular puts on a show changing from white to blues and purples.

I contacted the hotel and they said all guests are automatically charged a late check-out fee after a 30 minute grace period. When I made the reservation there was no mention of this policy. When I checked in no one mentioned this policy. If I had known that I was automatically going to be charged a $38 late fee after 30 minutes I would have changed my schedule that day.

I had asked for a room on a high floor and got the 8th, which wasn't bad, though not high enough to muffle street noise or for a view. Excellent location, a short walk to Grand Central Station and about 10 minutes to Time Square.The room itself was very quiet, clean and modernly furnished. Everything looked new as well. The bedroom was separated from the sitting room by a sliding glass door. The suite is equipped with a kitchenette, which was very handy. The bedroom area was tiny but sufficient. The sitting room was more spacious with a flat screen tv and two chairs. No sofa so we had to sit uncomfortably in chairs for hours after our son went to bed in the bedroom at 8pm. (There's an extra charge for cribs, so we brought our own pack n play.) Free wi-fi was a bonus.We booked through hotels.com about a week in advance for about $300 a night, non-refundable. The day we arrived I checked the rates for the suite and it had gone down to around $220. If you're able to book last minute, I think you can get a better deal than what we got. Nevertheless it was good value for a suite. The parking was $27 or so at an Icon garage (no in-out) near by. The door man (an older gentleman) was so cheerful and helpful. The people at the front desk at check-in and out (a tall young man and a dark haired woman) were pretty indifferent, but we didn't have any real need to interact with them. We didn't get a chance to use the amenities (gym, lounge) unfortunately.","Melrose, Massachusetts",0,4.0

Having stayed at the CQ in SF and at other NYC hotels, I was not disappointed by this one.Yes, there is no lobby, and there was only one person at the podium checking people in. But I didn't need a grand lobby, and perhaps I got lucky when I checked in because it was quick and painless. Yes, the room was on the small side, but it had everything I needed for that one night, and I must say I have been at other NYC hotels that are much older with much smaller rooms. This is a newer hotel, and the room was nicely done. You wouldn't want to swing any cats in the room, and it could get claustrophobic with more than 3 people there, but it was well laid out and quite comfortable.The attraction to this type of hotel is that you are not paying for those extras you don't really need. The bonus was the lounge room upstairs that provided a wide variety of snacks (which could be used to make a decent breakfast) and space to relax, have a drink, and look over the city skyline. The one night I was there it poured all day and night, so the view wasn't the best, but the potential is there. The hotel also provides you with bottles of filtered water, which is a plus.Conveniently located just one block from Grand Central Station, this hotel was perfect for my needs.

Upon arrival at 12:40 (check in isn't until 3:00), the receptionist checked us in early because a room was ready. They were also going to hold our luggage had the room not been ready. The room itself is just as pictured online.

We had taken the New York pass for 7 days and also took 7 day unlimited subway pass in case we needed to use it, and we did use it a lot to just roam around.

Day time try walking or using the subway which is faster and easy way around Manhattan, night time cabs are super fast. We took cabs to visit the Intrepid, 9/11 memorial, Empire State Bldg which was not too expensive. About the Club Quarters, try getting a room on a higher level as I heard people complain about the street noise. The rooms are smaller, but clean. there is free bottled water on every floor, free Wifi and you can chill out on the terrace with a drink or coffee. There is some free snacks, fruits and coffee too. It has a small gym room for people to exercise, and a laundry machine, which is great when travelling with kids or if you like to carry less clothes and its free (no need to carry coins yeah!). The downside is the machine is always occupied till late night as people use it a lot. The other downside for us was the kitchenette in the room was not what you will find in their website picture. It was just a coffee machine on top of a small fridge not the complete kitchenette with hot plate, sink, and dishes.The hotel staff is excellent, Jean and Christine are really good, helpful and always smiling. We had a problem with the A/C in the room the first night and Christine changed it immediately which was great. When we rented our car on the 9 night to drive the full east coast and Canada, Jean made sure it was safe outside the hotel and gave us the parking permission for the night so that we don't get a ticket.

It is reasonably enough priced for a new york hotel. It has a great location approximately 2 blocks I think from Grand Central so it was very handy just to get off the train and not to walk too far to our hotel. The staff were all very friendly and the hotel was clean. The reception area is small and could do with some chairs to sit on while you wait for bags etc. but that is only a very minor issue. Every floor has a filtered water dispenser with bottles as well which is a nice touch for the tourist who wants to explore the city! Also on the 27th floor is the club lounge, which you get in all the club Quarter hotels, they are just in different areas in the hotel. This lounge provides free tea and coffee, which was quite nice, but also free cans of soda and nibbles, an extra bonus. From the club lounge there is a lovely terrace from which you can get a great view of the Chrysler Building - which is extra beautiful at night. We stayed on the 24th floor and the noise from the street was still quite loud even with the windows closed, so I would suggest staying on a high floor as it can only be louder lower down!! Weirdly I think this may also be known as the Boutique Hotel Grand Central. The hotels are other side of the same city block and are connected internally. They do have two separate entrances though, separate reception desks so I couldn't be sure!!! I think it is both the Club Quarters and All is all a great hotel for short trips to the city!",Dublin Ireland,56,5.0

Services offered are minimal, the lobby is tiny, the rooms are small (though they are small in many other NYC hotels). The place has been recently updated and I saw no evidence of construction going on. As noted in other reviews the common area on the top floor is very nice, with a great outdoor space.

Fortunately it wasn't noisy, but it was a terrible view. Otherwise the room was well-appointed and comfortable. I loved the little formica table, which I used both as a desk and for eating a late dinner that I brought in.Two other things that I wasn't so happy about: The elevators were slow, but maybe due to the construction. The other was not having an iron and ironing board in the room.

Cleanliness: This is where I downgraded from a 4. I went to make a cup of coffee and found that the coffee mug had been obviously used (crusted material on the bottom and lipstick on the cup). The bathroom was clean and without mold. Security: There was no safe in the room. Needed key to use the elevator. Fitness room: Tight. 1/2 dozen machines, dumbbells and nautilus type equipment. They note that they will bring fitness equipment to your room. Restaurant: Davio's - didn't eat there at night, but a pilot that was leaving said the food there was fantastic. Ate the breakfast buffet. It was okay, nothing really to write home about. Overall: solid place that I would give another chance.","Seattle, Washington",43,3.0

Great for either personal or business stays. The hotel is equipped with meeting and lounging areas with snacks, coffee and sodas. The club room on the top floor was amazing with the highest quality furniture and a balcony overlooking NYC. Alberto Pichardo provided great service when assisting me in making reservations. He let me know where to park my car so I would get a significant discount for staying at the hotel. He also recommended Davios, a really nice restaurant in the same building, so we could a get a discount and free appetizers for being a hotel client. He also provided a list of alternatives for bars and restaurant in the area.

However, when the Club Quarters has excess capacity, it welcomes other guests. My short stay at Club Quarters was one of the most enjoyable I have had out of nearly a dozen trips to New York in the last year or so.I had a Club Room, which I feared would be too small. Much to my delight it was just fine. In addition to the bed, armoire, etc., there was a small L shaped table in one corner which was set up for connection with various technology (frankly I was not certain how it was to be used). The room is state of the art in terms of technology on multiple fronts.Two of my criteria for a high quality stay are towels big enough to wrap around myself and glass glasses. Club Quarters Grand Central provided both. There are also water dispenser scattered around the hotel.One of the really outstandng features is the ""living room"" on the 27th floor. First, the view over New York is wonderful, and there is even a balcony to allow guests more wonder in good weather. The living room offers computers, a printer, and a copier--all of the tools necessary to business travelers. It also provides plenty of work space and corresponding laptop connections.Another plus is the complimentary fresh fruit provided and the extraordinary coffee machine. It stores fine Italian coffee which is actually ground by the machine. Choose espresso, cafe latte, cappuccino, regular coffee, hot water for tea, etc. It's all there. Complimentary soda is also provided.The staff is terrific from the people at the front desk to the various others I met around the building. I enjoyed a wonderful stay and would readily return. I do have two small suggestions. First, there is a wonderful high tech alarm clock which allows charging of one's I-Phone, etc. However, I could not figure out how to set the alarm. It is possible that instructions are contained in the book in the room with general information, and if so the fault is mine for not thinking to look (until now). The second is to label the pitcher of white liquid by the coffee machine so one knows whether it is cream, milk or half and half. I actually prefer milk in my coffee and would have been delighted to find some of that in the refrigerator.These are, however, nitpicks. I should also mention that the hotel is truly a five minute walk or so to Grand Central Station. Once there you can catch a subway in various directions, including the shuttle to Penn Station. And, of course, there are an innumerable choice of restaurants.If you have the opportunity to visit the Club Quarters, particularly if you are in New York on business, you will not be disappointed.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",77,5.0

I would go again if I don't find something better but it would not be my first choice. I booked two sup rooms with kitchenettes. first I got two rooms without and after much discussion, I was given the rooms I had booked. I can talk about room 202 and 203. The kitchenette is really not usable as it is only a fridge and a (weak) microwave. it does not come with any supplies, such as spoons or bowls to warm anything in the microwave. One of the rooms did not even have a table to eat/snack at. the rooms are very nice and large though even though they are on the second floor. they just did not have ANY real storage space. we managed to buy milk and cereal and were able to have breakfast in the morning but we could not really manage to have any meals, not even light meals. As for their standard rooms, we also stayed in 2102 and 1502, and both rooms are small (to very small) with a queen bed and a small pull out bed. definitely not for three adults as they say and even small for 2 adults and a child (like us). there is barely room to move around the bed. Overall pros:1. People are very nice. 2. the room at the 27th floor is awesome3. free continental breakfast on weekend. it's not great but sufficient with bagels, coffee and patries. 4. free wifi everywhere and free computers at the 27th floor5. free laundry at the 3rd floor - awesome when you need to dry some clothes in a rush after a day in the rain6. amazing location on midtown east in front of grand central7. it has a small gymCons1. noisy even at the 21st floor2. small rooms3. kitchenettes are not functional4. cleanness is sufficient but not great. they do the rooms really fast and you can tell. 5. close to non-existent closet space","San Francisco, California",34,3.0

The photos certainly looked nice enough. However the first sign of problems came when upon trying to reach the hotel at the reception number, to discuss our two room options, calls were simply never picked up. We tried calling the hotel different days over the course of a week to no avail. Finally, the CQ main reservation number informed us they were having issues with staff at this hotel during busy hours and connected us directly through their main line themselves (they pick up when corporate calls). The young lady we spoke to was to have annotated our accounts and reservations with our very late arrival time, twin bed request for one room and a few minor requests. Upon our arrival, the single stand that constitutes the front ‘desk’ was manned by a very rude, self-righteous individual who informed me there were no notes in our reservations. He then stated that we must have called the wrong CQ. The tone of haughty disdain for the ""idiot out of town tourist"" could not have been more apparent. I explained the hellish experience of even trying to get through and the rude man basically again went off on how there is someone always at the desk and they always answer their phones. In other words, either I am lying, or I am an stupid. No possibility that he could be wrong and their hotel is going through growing pains or worse during the daytime busy hours. The tone with which we were reprimanded, standing in front of the single computer joke-of-a front-desk was absolutely offensive and ridiculous – but it was 3.30 am and we were too tired to argue. Up to the rooms, to find the worst, motel-6 level ‘twin’ beds- uncomfortable beyond belief, - child’s size -with the light joke-of-a-mattress falling off the bed with any body movement -- and two half-used shampoo/ mouth wash bottles at the foot of one of the beds, and the added bonus of an apple under the bed. Leftovers from the previous guests, of course- and proof of a housekeeping that simply could care less (in fact, looking between the beds, the level of filth for a hotel only a month old was astonishing). Furniture in the room was horribly cheap sub-IKEA, already scratched up, and a worthless central table attached to the floor that did not allow for any movement within the room. Everything is cheap and tacky and poorly laid out. Back downstairs (its now 4.30 am) to ask for extra pillows/bedding (a new guy at front desk does not know how to get these) – and to discuss checking out within a few hours (paying for the first night, cancelling the rest). Again, the “front desk” guy has no idea how to manage this, he says we have to wait for the hotel manager to come the next morning at 10 am. The rest of the ‘night’ was spent on the phone trying to procure a cancellation for the remainder of our stay at this at-best two star establishment-from-hell. The next morning, 30 minutes to check out in the check-in (standing room only) area cluttered with twenty people trying to check in or check out, and two incompetent female employees, one of which took another 12 minutes to figure out how to print me a receipt for our stay. We paid $440 for staying four hours at this hotel, and its an experience I won’t forget in a very long time. On top of extremely cramped and uncomfortable rooms, with the worst beds we have experienced in the U.S. in the last decade, the sheets and bedding are either not rinsed properly of the detergents, or over-starched with atypical materials. My body was covered in a rash after the short time in that bed. Guests would be advised to check out mold growth on the shower curtains in the shower stalls as well, since whoever outfitted this hotel has not thought out that detail either.The hotel is a 2 star, at best. Poor staff, poor rooms, poor beds, no front desk, no services, nothing. Will never stay here again.

Fortunately, I didn't pay for this out of my own pocket.I have considered bringing the family on a business trip, and having them stay with me, but I don't think I could have made this work at this hotel, simply because there isn't much room for additional cots in my standard sized room. On the plus side, there is a good business center on the 37th floor, with a few newspapers and magazines to share, free beverages, candy, nuts, TV, iMac computers, and a working printer/copy/scanner. The third floor has free laundry and a small workout room. But it almost seems like the the free touches suffice to remind a traveler of all of the more gracious places one could stay. Step outside of the business center to the terrace and you will find a very nice view of the Chrysler building and mid town.Also, on the plus side, the room was very nice. The bed was fantastic. The bath has modern fixtures. I liked the iPod station. The free internet was easy to connect to, and fast. There were plenty of electrical outlets.Security seems quite high in this property, with electronic door passes that limit guests to only specific floors (business floor, laundry/workout floor, lobby).

Conveniences like the free cold distilled water. Free sodas and snacks in the lounge. The workout area was ehh, but I walked about 2-3 miles a day so it was ok. If you can, I recommend the superior room, which has a kitchenette and a cool dining/work table. It just opened so there were a few bugs, but overall I was very pleased with the service and the people who worked there. One hint -- there are limited number of irons and ironing boards in a common room on each floor, so if you are like me and iron everything when you arrive, you may have to hunt around on a different floor if yours are all gone. That being said, it is packed up each day by housekeeping and returned to the common area, so no one can use it and forget it in their room.The ability to order from neighboring restaurants and have it charged to the room was also a great convenience. Just one word on that -- as a San Franciscan, the hoopla about Rickshaw Dumplings is just that -- your neighborhood Chinese joint serves better dumplings.The location, on the other hand, can't be beat.

Period. But I knew this going in - so they were exactly as expected - small.That being said, the rooms were clean and nice and actually a little bit more spacious than I had anticipated. I've stayed at the Pod hotels - which for the money are a good deal - but they are actually smaller than these rooms. I preferred Club Quarters for my business travel, because it is less ""clubby"" feeling. More business travelers as Club Quarters, less partiers.I'm giving these guys a 5 because I was actually pleasantly surprised by several things. The ""Club Living Room"" provides a free continental breakfast and coffee (limited variety - but quick and easy). It's set up nicely for business travelers - plenty of tables and workspaces. The 5 rating comes because I had already checked out and went to my early meeting and had 5 hours to kill before my flight. So, I came back to the Club Quarters (my luggage was stored) and the staff was very accommodating. They let me work in the Club Lounge (with free lattes) while I waited for my flight.I would definitely stay here again - especially if I'm looking for a good price in New York. If you are looking for spacious and luxurious, this is not it - you'll need to fork over the money to stay at a more upscale hotel. But I'm super particular - and this place is quite nice, just really small rooms. Summary:- Nice staff- Good place for business travelers on a budget- Great location- Nice rooms - clean, modern (hotel appears to be new or newly remodeled) - just small- The biggest downfall is the windows don't appear to be highly insulated and you can hear the street noise really well - Will definitely stay here again!","San Francisco, California",4,5.0

Definitely not your typical hotel atmosphere. Basically just a tiny reception area, your room and the business lounge on 27th floor where you can chill and also have breakfast. This is a great option if you need a no frills stay for business. Breakfast is self help but options are limited. The room is of fair size and staff downstairs are friendly. The place has only recently opened and builders are still around to finish their work in parts of the building. I chose this hotel for costreasons but it was not significantly cheaper than other hotels. The wifi internet is free and connection is fast. Overall experience was not bad but I am not yet convinced that this is a better option to other hotels.","Suider Paarl, South Africa",41,3.0

I meant to take pictures of both rooms, but completely forgot.I booked 2 standard rooms for 3 nights directly through the CQ website and paid in full. When I arrived, I was told that the hotel was booked and that my RESERVED and PRE-PAID rooms were not available. I was told I was being DOWNGRADED to (smaller) club rooms and would receive credit for the difference for all 3 nights of my stay. (But it was not made clear how many nights we’d be in the smaller rooms.) While there was no alternative, I do not find this acceptable. If I have already paid for a room, I absolutely expect it to be available. There is no excuse for this. I proceeded with checking in, but was not told how (or when) the situation would be resolved.Moving on...In my small club room, because of the layout and small window, I felt a little claustrophobic. It reminded me of being in an exam room at a doctor's office more than being in a hotel room. The full size bed was comfortable (although small for two people). There was a chair, a bedside table and a small closet area that holds a few garments. That's it. The only place to put luggage was a weird shelf-like area that was built into the wall where the window was. In the bathroom, there was not much room for toiletries. There was a narrow shelf above the toilet, but as others have said, things can easily fall into the toilet. The shower was very small--about the size of a shower stall in a gym locker room, maybe a little smaller. There was a teensy tiny shelf in the corner that barely held a bar of soap and bottle of shampoo. The towels? Yeah, they're hanging on the other side of the room, right beside the toilet (literally), in the ""splash zone"". (If you sat on the toilet, your leg would be touching a towel.)I was irritated with the smaller room--and the entire situation, but went on about my evening. When I returned to the room later that night, it was stuffy and I could not adjust the air conditioning. The thermostat was set to 75. When I attempted to change it, it would go right back to 75. I called the front desk and they sent someone up to check it. The boy they sent up had no idea about anything (at all) and tried to tell me the room didn't even appear to have air conditioning. He said he'd send up an engineer. After about 20 minutes and no news or engineer, I called the front desk again. I was told they were looking into it and someone would be up shortly. After another 20 minutes, I called again. I was told there was no engineer there so nothing could be done and there were no other rooms available. I was offered a fan and an Amazon gift card for my inconvenience. (A gift card, I later found out, that was already freely given to everyone.)The next morning, I went down and spoke with the front desk about the situation. Everything got sorted out. I was able to move into my standard room. The other party traveling with me opted to stay in the smaller room to avoid the hassle of changing rooms.The standard room was much more comfortable. It wasn't that much bigger, but felt like it due to the larger window. Unfortunately, it had the same small toiletry area at the bathroom sink. This bathroom, while larger, did not have the shelf above the toilet. The shower was identical. What was advertised as a ""work area"" (which I assumed to be a desk) was a small table beside a floor lamp in the corner. This was not even a table you could sit at. This room did not have the weird “wall shelf” so there was nowhere to put luggage other than the floor. (Really?!)While the air conditioner worked very well in this room (temperature-wise), it behaved quite strangely. When it was actually cooling, it seemed the fan was set to a lower speed. When it stopped cooling and just the fan was blowing, it seemed to change speeds to high. I like white noise when I sleep, but the constant changing in volume woke me up several times.The free bottled water that is offered? That's empty (sealed) bottles that you fill yourself from a cooler in the hallway.Breakfast is said to be served until 10, but runs out well before 9.As other have noted, the elevators are EXTREMELY slow.One other odd note, taking the stairs down leads directly to the street. The outside door is not locked and can be accessed by anyone. I did not check to see if the inside doors leading back to the floor of the hotel were locked. (There was nowhere to swipe your room key if they were.)On a positive note, this hotel seemed very clean and the location was great. The subway was about 4 blocks away, though. If you stay here, check out Uncle Paul's Pizza. (It's listed in the little hotel notebook beside the bed.) They have DELICIOUS, inexpensive pizza and are open 24 hours! (If you check-in there on Foursquare, you can get $10 off!) There's also a nice Irish pub, The Perfect Pint, that's close by. They have a great draft beer selection and decent food.If I did not have the check-in/smaller room problem, my experience would have been much more positive. Barring that issue, I'd consider staying here again. My invoice shows they did apply the credit for the difference in the room costs, but I can't confirm that I received it until it shows up on my credit card.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",7,3.0

We booked the Club Room - the smallest room available, but still about 200sq ft, which is not bad for NYC (depending how much you pay for it). Positives: this is still a new property, so it's all new and clean; there was a complimentary breakfast (coffee, yogurt, pastries), BUT make sure you come early because they can run out of food. The service is pretty good.Negatives: there was no desk in the room or second chair - BIG NEGATIVE for someone traveling for business (or even for a couple); the bathroom in the Club Room is smallish; there is a shelf right above the toilet and things tend to fall into the toilet if it's open; it was still a bit noisy (but we were warned about it); only one elevator was working for most of the weekend (not a huge negative for us, but can be annoying for some).","Ithaca, New York",3,4.0

They are all excellent hotels but the CQ Grand Central is by far the best of them. What makes it stand out among the others, even with the construction still going on) is its location and its staff. This is the newest hotel in the chain, very well designed and very comfortable. Amenities are better then what you might expect, all is high tech and user friendly. 3 Mac desktops and a printer in the breakfast lounge on the 27 floor, where tee/coffee and snacks and fruit are available 24/7. But most of all I'd like to say that the front desk staff is really exceptional. In particular Michelle was very friendly, helpful and professional in all my dealings with her and what I observed in her interactions with other guests and her colleagues. It is obvious that those who work at this location are not only friendly towards the guests but also towards each other which makes this hotel a very friendly and welcoming place indeed. This is bu far my favorite place in NYC now.Thank you, Michelle. Wladek K",NYC,1,5.0

Since the hotel had just opened they offered a complimentary continental breakfast. They are still working out some details - coffee machine stopped working during breakfast but there are Nespresso / Keurig coffee makers in the rooms. The terrace off the lounge was not yet open.

The hotel opened only last Sunday so although there is some building work going on and a few finishing touches such as Davios (opens in October), I really feel this hotel represents great value for money. My company has corporate rates for the CQ hotels globally and this really is a great great new hotel for its brand.Location: 4th and Lexington. You can walk everywhere very easily from this hotel which is good considering the UN are in session this week. Grand Central is a stone throw away and you can catch the subway there to get just about anywhere.Rooms: Exceptionally clean and big for midtown. I was lucky enough to get a bigger room as I was staying for a long whle (9 nights). This wasn't possible on my first night but by the next day, they had picked up my luggage, taken it to the new room and I got my new keys when I came back in. For Apple fans, the alarm clock allows you to charge your iPhone or iPad on it and still charge another device. They even provide the cables for you. Bed is large and comfortable and you can open the windows to get fresh air into the room - I definitely recommend Room 1204.Club living room: Definitiely worth a mention. Complimentary breakfast and snacks throughout the day, amazing view of the Chrysler building, two TVs, comfy chairs, iMacs and a business centre. Plenty of papers - the terrace isn't open quite yet but I imagine it will be a great backdrop for photos!Staff: They really make the place. They have been constantly helpful, hard-working and really friendly. Nothing is too much for them and considering they've still only got half-occupancy whilst the rest of the rooms are being finished, I think they're doing great.Other bits: In-room dining is available (deli, Italian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese), laundry charges are reasonable, free wifi throughout the building with a strong strong signal, free purified water and exceptionally comfortable bedding, towels etc.","London, United Kingdom",101,5.0
