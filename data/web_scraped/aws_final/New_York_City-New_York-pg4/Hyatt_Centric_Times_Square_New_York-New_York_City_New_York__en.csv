I requested early check-in, since we were arriving about 5 hours before the 4 p.m. check-in. They held our luggage so we could go out and grab lunch and they texted me when our room was ready (2-3 hours early). The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The beds were super-comfortable, which is a big deal to me - I often have a hard time sleeping, so supportive pillows and soft linens are really important. Towels and toiletries were replenished every day; we never had to ask for anything.The location on 45th Street is steps away from Times Square and most of the theaters; across the street from a Starbucks; and just a couple blocks away (in various directions) to Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park, and the train stations around 42nd Street. It was a roughly 20-minute walk from the hotel to the Intrepid Air, Sea and Space Museum. This hotel was an excellent home base for us; no matter where we were in the morning or early afternoon, we'd come back to rest for a bit before our evening plans.Years ago we had a terrible experience at a ""proper"" Hyatt in Florida and I wasn't sure I'd ever go to a high-end Hyatt property again. We've stayed in a Hyatt Place and liked it, but it took us six or seven years to be willing to try a property like this one. And they made it so wonderful. If you're looking for a comfortable hotel to be your home base in Times Square/Midtown, give Hyatt Centric Times Square a try.","Titusville, Florida",13,5.0

Due to the pandemic NYC was very quiet so we were offered the chance to upgrade the room for $25 per night, we declined this as didn’t intend on being in the room that much. The room we had, on 20th floor, was really nice. Could see some of time square lights, plenty of room (By NYC standards) and a big bathroom. The hotel is yards from time square, an ideal location if you are a first timer to New York. I felt the pricing was a little inconsistent, when we asked before we arrived about cars to and from the airport we were quoted $120 (ish) each way, however, when we asked at the hotel it was $75 set fee. We opted for this as it was only $5 more than the total price of a set fee yellow cab. When we asked to keep the room on it was $50 per hour, which seemed excessive considering NYC was in an emergency situation and travel was prohibited from a lot of countries so rooms were available and an upgrade was only $25.Staff were helpful when needed. It’s clean and tidy but for some reason we both got electric shocks off of everything we touched. We ended up touching everything through clothes, which I suppose wasn’t bad thing considering the circumstances. Would stay here again. ","Brough, United Kingdom",11,4.0

This was my first experience at a Hyatt property in the US and my only previous frames of reference in terms of US hotels were Marriott and Hilton properties. This was a long 16-day trip and I was more than a little concerned about being comfortable. I was so cautious that I had my office split the booking so that I could check out if I was not happy. This hotel blew me away. The room and bathroom were great and everything worked the way it should. The decor and color schemes made everything seem airy and light. But the X Factor was the service. I have never experienced this level of warmth and friendliness outside of Taj, ITC and Shangri La properties in Asia. The staff were efficient, proactive, warm and friendly and they anticipated my needs. The GM of this hotel deserves to be commended for putting together and leading such a great crew.

Floor 43. Fantastic view and GREAT staff in all areas of this hotel, My previous favorite hotel in NYC was Double Tree Suites Time Square which is now only history as it was completely torn down in 2019. The site will be a CTX luxury hotel, which is being built now to open in 2022. This Hyatt is better located than the Doubletree was as it is a half block down 45th st. from Broadway (heart of times square) AWAY from the constent crowds. The Doubletrees front door opened on to Broadway and was alwaus a mess. You pay for a better view if you reserve a room above floor 40. DO IT as you will be happy you did. Also, buy the breakfast package with the rooom. You eat in the very nice hotel restaurant NOT a buffet and order off the menu , the same meniu walk-ins order from.

Resort Fees here are $30 per room per night. They are not optional and must be paid. If they can't afford to run the hotel based on their advertised room rates then they should increase their rates, not draw people in with artificially low rates topped up with ""Resort Fees"". Apparently its for Wi-Fi, water in room and I think that's it.A deposit of $100 is required and check in is not possible without it. It must be on a hold on a card or if you want to leave a cash deposit its $350.00.

I contacted the hotel prior to arrival to see if they do anything special for birthdays, as our trip was for my husband’s birthday, a lovely lady named Lotis gave me a list of options available and I must say she went above & beyond in her customer service to make his birthday extra special, even giving us $75 credit to spend in the hotel. We used the credit towards his birthday meal at T45 which we regretted as most of our food was returned uneaten, the starters weren’t great, my husband’s steak was medium not medium rare and my son’s burger was raw! The staff were disinterested, no apology & no contact from the F&B team after I emailed my complaint, would not recommend the restaurant as the food was overpriced & underwhelming! However, our hotel room (on 51st floor) was clean & spacious with good sized bathroom, it’s a shame the Hyatt don’t have family rooms with one queen & two single beds instead of two queens like most european hotels as 2 siblings sharing a bed can cause arguments. The hotel is in a great location, although you do pay $40 a night resort fee for the privilege which wasn’t mentioned when we checked in, we only knew through reading trip advisor, and we were not given any discounts etc. or told what the fee was for.

I believe sometimes this may be part of your package and it maybe worth asking the question before you book They put a hold on your Card when you arrive the same amount as what the room costs, so take this into consideration if you have assigned an amount of money you will spend in New York because a large amount will be taken as soon as you arrive to cover any charges on the room. To be fair you will get this back but minus the tax which in our case was $172 for five nights. We have only come back and not received it yet but I am sure we will.So if you have loaded up a pre paid card as we did try to add extra onto it because you won’t be spending this in New York and will be coming back with you, which is always nice to come back to.",,0,5.0

Other than soap, shower gel and shampoo, there were no other bathroom essentials provided. Everything had to be requested which I found odd and inconvenient, especially for a Hyatt property.2. The pillows in the room were much too soft for me. I requested a firm pillow (which any decent hotel I've been to has - some hotels have a range of pillows including memory foam) but I was informed the hotel did not have any firm pillows - I thought that was odd.3. Hotels in NYC which are charging a resort / destination fee need to be highlighted, it's essentially a scam. Just because some other hotels do it and because it's detailed on the Hyatt website does NOT make it ok. This Hyatt cannot justify the $35 ($40.16 with tax) fee per night (!) with the very poor 'benefits' provided. More guests need to challenge the fee, otherwise more and more hotels will continue to add it to the headline rate.4. I was surprised at the lack of communal space - the lobby is tiny and there's nowhere to sit and relax other than the bar.As for location, if you want to be near Time Square then the location can't be beaten, but if you've been to NYC more than once then you may appreciate being away from the hustle and bustle.In terms of value for money, I booked my room at a promotional price so I thought the value for money was acceptable, but seeing how much the rooms are normally I would say this hotel is NOT good value for money as I would expect more luxury for the price.Overall this isn't a bad hotel, just not the luxury what you might expect from a Hyatt property.","London, United Kingdom",59,3.0

I stayed in the Suite facing Times Square. The room was big enough for our family of 4 and the bathroom was the best part. Heated floors and room enough for all of us to be walking in the bathroom at the same time. Now besides that. My vacation started off stressful. I was never made aware before getting to the hotel that I would be charged all of my vacation plus $100 deposit per night. A “hold” was placed on my card that I was not going to use to pay for the hotel but had no alternative at the time was blocked for almost $2000. What I was gonna use for my vacation. When I’m questioning why I have to essentially pay before I even get in my room. The response is “this is how it always is” with an attitude. I’ve been to many hotels and many higher end hotels and none of them do this. They take a deposit and your card on file but no one blocks the entire stay plus a deposit for the duration of your stay + 5 days that it takes for the hold to drop. When I mention that this have never been done before in other hotels I’ve stayed at the response from the team member is “I’ve stayed at other hotels too” again with his attitude. I honestly don’t need that attitude. I’m on vacation and I’m already stressing and I don’t see how him staying at other hotels has anything to do in this situation. Off to a horrible start I didn’t even want to deal with the front desk anymore. The housekeeping staff however was wonderful and attentive. Always would say good morning and even hoped to see us again soon. Our second interaction with the front desk same person went even worse. My brother got to the hotel with his suitcase in the middle of the night as he had to take a red eye. I understand they ask to make sure he’s staying there. That’s fine no problem. But when he says he is they give him a card and say it’s $40/daily charge for the hotel. That didn’t make sense because we already had booked 4 people and been charged for the daily hotel fee for 4 people. When my mom went to ask about it to make sure it was already included and not additional. Just needed some clarification the team member again with an attitude called my brother liar saying no one had said it was $40 when it was written on his key card envelope they gave him. My mom said I’m not saying you did I’m asking for clarification and he just seemed like he didn’t want to deal with anything. We just left and avoided them the rest of the time. After that they didn’t seem approachable and didn’t feel like I could ask them questions about the city. In all honesty I personally won’t be staying again. Initial interaction and welcome is what makes or breaks it for me. I do recommend the room though. But that’s all I recommend.,"Austin, Texas",0,4.0

On Friday, again I asked front desk to arrange housekeeping at lunch (prior I had put up the ""do not disturb"") notice, the lady at front desk just said that as long as the notice was down, it would be done. I returned after lunch and housekeeping hadn't arrived, not until 4.30pm did I get a knock, I asked them to come back at 5pm.. I left and returned around 6.30 and only then was the housekeeping in my room, which is quite disappointing. I also asked front desk if I could get a later check out, after about 5 mins of clicking on the computer, she told me I could check out at noon. I'm pretty sure one hour extension is quite standard practise, if she was going to offer me til 3pm I'd understand wasting 5 minutes of my time! So I'm not sure the purpose of acting like that.

After spending several hours researching all nearby properties, I landed on Hyatt based on the location, room type, and reviews. I stayed in the King Suite w/ terrace. I will review a few different elements from my experience:- Location: Everything is so close! Times square is a block away. So many wonderful restaurants to choose from. Central Park is a nice walk. 9/11 memorial is a quick Lyft or taxi ride away. I spent several afternoons just walking and exploring the area.- Room: The room I was in was incredibly spacious by New York Standards. The room came with a refrigerator, desk, separate living room, sizable bathroom and shower. The view from the terrace is amazing! You have a clear view of Times Square, World Trade Center, Empire State building, and so much more. The only non-raving comments I have relate to the bed and pillows. The bed is fairly stiff but after 12 nights, I was accustomed to it. The pillows were so flimsy and seemed old. I asked for foam pillows after the first night (which are offered free of charge), which were only slightly better. The staff was incredibly accommodating and provided extra pillows and blankets.Food (T45 Diner): The food was very good! The restaurant has a nice menu and you can order anything off of that menu for room service. Room service was quicker than any other hotel I have stayed at in the last 5 years. Also, check out Bar54 at the very top of the building. It has breathtaking views and a nice ambience.Hotel Staff: 12 days is a long time to spend at a hotel and I can honestly say that I had great service from the hotel staff for the entire duration of my stay. From a wonderful check-in experience (thank you Ritchie!), the room service staff, the cleaning staff, and security, everyone was professional and kind.Overall, I would recommend this gem to anyone looking for a great place to stay in New York.

While searching for rooms online there are many sources indicating Hyatt Centric is a hotel where you can see the ball drop. The room we selected had a description ""Times Square view"". Prior to booking we called on 2 occasions to ensure we have the perfect room to watch the ball drop and be apart of the exciting celebration. Both times we were advised yes we would see the ball drop. The rooms we booked was very expensive and we thought it was going to be worth it, we were willing to spend the money since we did not want our children in the cold and insane crowd for this celebration. We checked in on 12/30 and was so very disappointed with our room, you could only see the back of a billboard next to a building that blocked most of the view of times square and the ball drop was not in view. Hyatt Centric Times Square NYC hotel was misleading and dishonest from day 1. We spoke to 2 different people at the check-in desk and they said none of their rooms can see the ball drop and we could purchase the top of the bar access for $1000 +per person if we wanted to see the ball drop...... they genuinely was not concerned about our disapointment. Their goal was to move us along and check in the next person. We booked 2 rooms for our family of 6 people and spent over $5k at this hotel. I called the front desk to ask for a manager and she apologized and said they would credit me for the inconvenience, I received a folio with a credit of $80 and then they charged me $100 without providing the folio for the 2nd room or explaining why I was charged.

Minutes from Times Square, handy for the Rock, Empire State, Union Station, Bryant Park, theatres, subway so that you can easily access Battery Park and out to Statue of Liberty and One World Tower, Madison Square Gardens to see the Ice Hockey (highly recommended) and anywhere you want to go at that end of the city. The rooms and beds are comfortable and well furnished (although one of our lights did not work) and the floor to ceiling windows in our Suite were superb. The staff at check-in were less than friendly but everyone else we met were lovely. The hotel has a rooftop bar with superb views day and night and it is a nice place to sit and have a drink after a busy day sightseeing. We had a lovely lady from Jamaica who cleaned our room and she could not have been any more friendly, chatty or helpful - I'm only sorry I did not get her name. The Assistant Operations Manager, Mr Rico Hernandez, was also very helpful when my daughter was unwell during our stay. I had breakfast in our room one morning and it was perfectly pleasant - fluffy, warm pancakes and hot tea. Reception staff were happy to organise more pillows, provide a sewing kit after a slight wardrobe malfunction and to provide a kettle when my daughter needed one. The bar downstairs is ideal for a drink or snack at the end of the day and the staff were nice - they even put drinks in plastic glasses to take up to your room on the one night we couldn't go out as planned when my daughter was unwell. The hotel was nicely decorated for the festive season and staff are very knowledgable and helpful. The hotel helped us arrange transfers to and from the airport, which was very reasonable and worked well. We were given a late checkout of 2pm as our flight was not until 8pm, and we apreciated this extra time to relax a bit. The only negative comment I have was on the location of our Suite. Security staff check that you have a key, so nobody can get around to the lifts and rooms without being challenged. We were in Room 1401 (suite), which is right above the main front entrance. Given the location of the hotel and the vibrant nature of New York, we fully expected noise. However, I did expect that we would get a night's sleep! Sad to say, none of us had one night's sleep in the 7 days of our holiday. The beds are so comfy it shouldn't be a problem, but the noise was horrendous! It starts at Midnight with a Refuse Collection right under your window which takes time, and all the associated noise/engine running (sometimes collectng from the other side of the road from restaurants etc), then there is another type of collection at around 3 am and then again at around 5 am. There is also a tremendous amount of building work/renovations and repairs to buildings to prevent falling masonry taking place and this goes on all night too, as the building with work across the road has a permit to work during the night, as do many buildings in the city. On one of the nights this led to work at 2 am where the street had one side coned off and an enormous truck full of supplies and 2 small vehicles going up and down with materials for several hours. I appreciate that this is not the fault of the Hyatt, however, had we had any knowledge of this we would not have stayed in this room! A good night's sleep means you can explore this amazing city in all it's glory all day and late into the night. As it was the run up to Christmas, the hotel was extremely busy or we would have enquired about a change of room. We feel that this coloured our view of value for money for this Suite - given the issues (and having stayed in many other Hyatt hotels and in busy cities), we feel that the price per night was too high. We did have a fantatstic holiday and can highly recommend a visit to ew York at this time of year. The hotel is really nice, but some prior information about the rooms would have been good. With a different room, we would recommend a stay here as the location cannot be beaten and it is a nice hotel.","Glasgow, United Kingdom",112,4.0

As soon as the sweet cleaning staff found out there were 4 of us in one room, they gave us extra towels and toiletries to help with our stay. I made sure to tip them every day to show our appreciation. The front desk accepted a delivery for me and then left it in our room while we were at a Broadway show like I asked them to - which was extremely helpful because it was meant to be a surprise upon our return to the room. =) We requested extra pillows because ours provided zero support, but literally, no matter how many you added, they went flat and you woke up with a sore neck the next day. As for getting questioned in the evenings when we went to get on the elevator... I know they are doing it because of the rooftop bar, but still, it's a hassle when you're just wanting to go to your room and don't want to have to stop to dig for a key to prove yourself. My daughter witnessed someone's son who ran down to get something from the front desk for his dad get stopped for a long period of time because he didn't take his room key down with him. I don't know how they can make this better, but it gets annoying. Overall, it's a nice hotel in a great location, and we would stay there again. I'd probably just have to pack a pillow!

The hotel delivers as promised, with rooms being of either average or slightly less-than-average in size versus other hotels. You cannot beat the location for Times Square, Broadway, and being centrally located. However, traffic getting to and from the hotel can be crazy since 45th street leads directly into Times Square. The front-desk staff are very helpful, the rooms are clean, everything appears to be in good condition and working order. My negative comments are as follows: 1. Concierge staff refused to order flowers for me, instead directing me to a third-party vendor (DIY) which is something I have never experienced at another hotel, 2. Some waitstaff at breakfast restaurant are not very friendly and they were playing games with each other over the music and lighting settings in the restaurant to the detriment of the customers, and 3. Security at the hotel is virtually non-existent even though there is usually someone standing between the front desk and the entrance to the elevators. This person was observed to be looking down at her phone more often than not, and there is nothing that prevents someone from going to or from the club on the 54th floor from accessing a guest floor and following you to your hotel room. Access to guest floors in the elevators is not key-controlled but it would not matter as long as club customers have the same access to the same elevators the guests use. If you are a single traveler concerned about about safety and security, consider this when choosing where to stay. One night, there was one person asking to see room keys before you got on the elevators but this was once for a short time over a 5 day / 4 night stay. And they were only asking selected individuals about this. Again, the location is great for NYC activities, the rooms are nice, and you get Hyatt points if that appeals to you, like it did me.

I have stayed here for years now, and I am always impressed with the unobstructed Times Square views that most rooms provide. The Hyatt staff are friendly, and attentive to your needs; they are always happy to assist me in their capacity to do so. I do believe that their rooms are in need of an overhaul; my years of visiting the hotel has shown a consistent decline in the condition of the room furniture (scratches on the meubles, destroyed mouldings, unvarnished furniture, etc). I understand that “wear and tear” are a normal part of the industry, but charging $400USD per night gives no excuse as to why the furniture has not been replaced or maintained. I would also add that there is a heavy focus in sustainability (which I find wonderful), but the Hyatt needs to get its act together on its room service. I order fries and it came packaged in a plastic container placed in a plastic bag, accompanied by plastic forks/knives in plastic wrapping...what ever happened to 5-star room service? The Hyatt always seems to impress me with the quality of its service, rooms and design. Their membership program is awesome too!

On almost every occasion, the Kimpton Muse has been my home away from home. I’ve always had fantastic stays there, and woukd happily have chosen to stay there again when I decided to spend the entire week in the City, but it was just too expensive.With that in mind, after much searching, I stumbled across the Hyatt Centric Times Square, advertising a rate of $281 per night for a king room with a Times Square view. I must say upfront that the real price of this room is not $281 per night. Including taxes ($44.88), destination fee ($34.42) and valet parking ($80), it’s nearly $440 per night. And they will put a hold on your credit card for $100 per night for incidentals (which are credited back at the end of your stay). This is all standard for most hotels, but can be a shock to someone who isn’t expecting it.Charges aside, this hotel is exceptional! Even before we arrived, I was able to check in online and receive a text message when our room was ready (two hours before regular check in time!) The check in process took less than five minutes. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. When we decided to sleep in (very late!) on our first day, a note was slipped under the door telling us to call if we wanted our room serviced. We left at 5pm for dinner and a show, and came back to a freshly made up room. The bed linens are the softest I’ve come across in any hotel - EVER! The room is equipped with all the things you’d expect- TV, keurig, mini fridge, iron, hairdryer, etc. The rooftop bar is reportedly the highest in Manhattan, and the views are spectacular. (Drink prices may also be among the highest in Manhattan, as our tab for 4 drinks was over $100). The location cannot be beat! Steps from Times Square, the Theater District, Fifth Avenue, Grand Central, and LOTS of restaurants on this block of W 45th Street alone!

For starters, it is a in a perfect location on 45th between Sixth and Seventh Avenue, so it is really convenient for mid-town business needs and for theater-goers. I was concerned when I checked in about street noise from my room on the 18th floor, but I did not even notice any noise at all -- the windows did very well in blocking sound.The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. My desk clerk Ritchie was great. The hotel has almost no lobby to sit in because it devotes space to a restaurant, which was the one modest blip.The rooms were very spacious (and not just my skimpy NY room standards), modern, well-designed and well-equipped. They were also quite attractive and functional. The bedding was comfortable and attractive. They offered a ""featherless"" room, which I requested and got, which could explain the comfort of the bedding and pillows. The lighting was way better than any hotel I have been in recently, with multiple options on switches throughout the room. The bathroom was very modern and attractive with a huge shower stall that had a rainfall shower head. There were two modern phones and a cool clock in the room. The ventilation system had individual settings that actually worked. The entertainment package was state of the art.Most of all, the actual rate was very reasonable for such modern quality. With a AAA discount, the rate (before all the NY taxes) was only $379 a night, which was very low to the prices that I was quoted almost everywhere else at hotels that were not up to the quality and conveniences of the Hyatt Centric.I was really pleased with my stay. My only slight criticism is that this hotel has fallen prey to the unfortunate destination fee ($30 per night) for services that either ought to have been provided in the room rate (like free internet and small plastic water bottles) or provided for discounts for services that I suspect few would really care about. That aside, I certainly would be pleased to stay here again.","Chicago, Illinois",64,5.0

Rooms also very well thought through in terms of the little things, lighting, storage, bathroom layout. The things I often think could be done better in a hotel room had been done here. Plenty room for a family of 4 which for a city room was impressive. Our minus point - The hotel has an amazing rooftop bar with stunning views. However, children can only go up at 10.30am for a quick view escorted by a staff member. I understand that children up there in the evening may not be what they want. However, we have stayed in city hotels like this all over and have always been able to use this sort of place with the children in the daytime and at least until a certain time of night (they are teenagers not toddlers).

And, we checked in right at check-in time at 4 p.m., and checked out right at the maximum extended check-out time of 12 p.m. Because it is expensive to get the Deluxe King Times Square View, I would go with this strategy. Do you sightseeing, etc. and stay at a lower-priced hotel. Then, when you go to the Hyatt, just stay there, enjoy the view, eat locally and there you go!The room is very good! You pay for it, with the final charge closing in on $500 for one night with the (crazy) resort fee, and all the taxes. There is a good amount of room. There is a small refrigerator, there is a Keurig coffee maker. The floors only have about 10 rooms per floor, so are pretty quiet, and the ice maker is close by.The view is spectacular with floor to ceiling windows! They are well insulated for temperature and sound. You will hear little of what is outside.You can go to the rooftop bar. There is a maître d' who is ready to get people tables. As a hotel guest, I just showed him my room card and told him that I was staying at the hotel. That way, I was able to walk right out to the balcony to enjoy the views. The waiters are unobtrusive, and don't bother you for drink orders, etc. unless you want one and seek them out.Again, the views are beautiful! And, as a guest, you can go up at 10:30 a.m. each morning if you meet in the lobby. You are taken up by guest services for time to enjoy the views before the bar opens for the day.The hotel is designed in the millennial/hipster/European style. Graffiti art adorns the lobby, and the decor is mostly white. So, if that's your thing, you're in luck! The service is in the New York/European detached style. So, warm and friendly ISN'T what to expect! But, the guest services lady who took us up to the rooftop in the morning was very nice and that was appreciated!Also, you WILL NOT be checking in before 4 p.m. So, don't expect it. Even when we were right there at 4 p.m., the room they had set aside for us was STILL not ready.

When I asked the Reception about this recurring issue, the response of the Guest relations was a 'what can I do about it? This is the only way to dial and if it doesn't work, we can't help you!'Guest Services after 11 pm does not answer. Carpet in the room is musty and dirty. This is one Hyatt property I would definitely not return to, nor, recommend to anyone.

But not a showstopper. The staff was professional. They did their job. The room was decent. The beds were clean and soft. The carpet floor could have been better for the price they charge for the room. Not barefoot worthy. Definitely need slippers. Lots of reviewers mentioned about quite rooms. But we were not so lucky. Being on the 10th floor, street noise was clearly audible. We even heard people talking & laughing from the next room. Other minor things (not issues) which didn't effect our stay but could have been better - there was a spent/used coffee pod in the Keurig coffee maker when we arrived. In their amenities list provided in the room, only few items were available. A few words about ""Destination Fee"" :- As the trend of adding ""Resort Fee"" is picking up steam all across US, the $30 Destination fee per night to avail coffee or a 10% discount here, a 20% discount there was a bummer. One may not drink coffee or avail those treatment services. For them it's a sheer waste of money.The Marriot nearby gives you $30 restaurant credit, a tour ticket and more for their destination fee. It might make sense in a casino hotel in Vegas or an actual resort but not in a typical hotel. But more and more run of the mill hotels are adding it. Lesson learned. Will be trying to avoid ""Resort Fee/Destination Fee"" hotels in future, whether it's possible or not that's a different matter.The best feature is the proximity to the Times Square. Also the 42 street subway is nearby. Overall a decent place.","Atlanta, Georgia",1,4.0

However, my initial impression of my room was underwhelming, as there were notable carpet stains, including gum stains that appeared to have dried over a period of time. I wanted to address this issue with the front desk, but I had a 12pm lunch reservation, so I returned to the hotel around 3pm to speak with the staff, who happened to be Michael at the time. His immediate response was, “Why didn’t you tell us earlier?” No apologies given on behalf of the hotel whatsoever, but rather an accusatory question to a guest who had higher customer service expectations from a hotel like Hyatt - especially when I had spent a significant amount of money to reserve an executive suite. I approached him politely, and asked if another room was available. He stated that there weren’t any available and even if there were, I would not be able to inspect the room ahead of time; rather, I would have to take a risk and choose the new room (without inspection), or stay at my current suite. He suggested that I check back tomorrow morning.The next morning, I thank God Yenny was available. She quickly apologized and showed me an available room; however, due to the particular arrangement of the new room, I decided to stay at my current suite, as my mother was coming into town and needed extra space. Although I had to stay in the suite with carpeting that desperately needed shampooing (or replacement), the way Yenny approached the matter completely compensated for my poor experience with Michael.Even the simple apology from Yenny made all the difference. She truly cares about her work and goes above and beyond. She deserves a deferential pay raise and recognition from management for demonstrating stellar customer service.As for Michael, he needs additional training on how to approach and respond to guests. He kept a calm tone throughout our conversation, but the way in which he responded with that accusatory question (in addition to statements like “that’s what happens in hotels; we get stains and there’s not much we can do about it”) left such a sour taste of Hyatt Centric Times Square. However, Yenny’s immediate response quickly made up for it.","Los Angeles, California",0,3.0

I have some “status” with Hyatt so maybe that’s why they had my contact info because a week or so before the trip I got an email from Joshua asking if I had any requests and he offered to be of assistance to me. This was so unusual - in a good way! This is the first time I have had this experience so I took him up on his offer to explain that I had reserved two rooms and asked him to help secure two rooms adjacent to each other. And he replied promptly that he would look into this. Then when we arrived in NYC, I asked to say hello to him to say thanks and it was a pleasure to meet him. There was some rain the days we were there and he contacted me to let me know there were ponchos for me and umbrellas at the front desk. So helpful. The hotel is in the perfect location. A block or so away from Times Square so incredibly close but not right in the middle of it. Walking distance to Broadway theaters, United Nations, Rockefeller’s Square, NBC studios, Empire State Building - so many attractions within walking distance. I liked staying in midtown because seemed central to everything. We walked a lot during the trip and saw so much. Uber rides to upper and lower Manhattan was easy too - plenty of sidewalk space for cars to pick up in front of the Hyatt Centric. Never felt rushed or crowded in. The entire staff was awesome. Polite. Courteous. Rooms comfortable and well kept up. Housekeeping was good. Everything met my hopes and expectations. I would definitely recommend the Hyatt Centric.

We book a 1 King Bed Times Square View Deluxe room. The website reads, ""Perched from the 41st floor or higher take in the bright light views of Times Square."" We did not receive the room we booked. We were ""upgraded"" without notice to a room on the 24th floor that looked at the side of an adjacent building. When we returned to the front desk to address the issue we were first told that there were no rooms with a view of Times Square due to the way the building is situated. After pulling up the reservation on my phone and showing the representative how the online description reads, I asked if they have any rooms matching that description. The representative left the desk and returned saying that those rooms were unavailable. We were eventually moved to a higher floor with a much better view, but for a once in a lifetime getaway that we had been anticipating for months as a birthday celebration, it was a significant let down to not receive the room described and to be either mislead and/or lied to by the representative at the desk. I reached out to management before writing this survey to find out what happened and I was assured the rooms DO exist and that the change came about because we were ""randomly selected"" for an upgrade due to being a World of Hyatt member; however, we booked at the Hyatt Centric for our first visit to NYC specifically because of the description of the room we reserved. The manager did say that he would make sure the representative was familiar with the various rooms and views the hotel offers, but beyond that, there was no further compensation. We still don't know why we didn't receive the room we booked. It was a shame to start our stay in such a wonderful city with such confusion and back-and-forth literal months after making the reservation and spending $1.5K. After all that, there was an additional, undefined $103.26 charged to my card on top of the initial reservation charge when we received the final bill.

The day before we left I spoke with the valet and we reserved a black car for a ride to LGA at 5:15 am. We were quoted a price and were told someone would be waiting for us. When we left the next morning, there was a car waiting outside however the driver was not aware of our reservation. The valet station wasn’t staffed yet, but the gentleman in the car said he would take us to the airport. Either the reservation wasn’t made or something got messed up. Either way we should have been given a bit more info from the valet. Highly recommend this hotel! ","Loveland, Colorado",56,5.0

Very expensive for what you get and you have to also pay a $30 per day ""resort ""BS"" fee"" that upsets any customer the most, if you are paying really high taxes and hotel fees, whay they should come with this BS fees to milk up customers, Resort Fees for what??? because they have a little gym that any cheap motel in the side of the road will have, and because they are providing you FREE internet and Cable? so it is not FREE, and in top of that if you have any problem with internet and TV connection they can not do anything in this location to fix it.Ridicules experience! It makes me wonder if all this high rated reviews are paid reviews, There is a misleading and bad use of Luxury and High End and Five Stars Hotels and that should be fixed.Bottom Line, is whatever hotels needs to charge to make their stock holders happy do it, but don't pretend or publicity your self as almost 5 stars hotel if you really can not provide that experience.Location by the way is Chaotic. too much traffic of cars and people specially in that area.",,2,1.0

Would have been better had we not booked with “Breakfast Included.” This concept needs rethinking in my opinion, or until a change is made just book the room.The Good: Our room was on the 36th floor. Was a decent size to not feel claustrophobic considering its location. Located right next to Times Square made its location great for sightseeing. We literally walked everywhere.The valets and most security ladies were very kind and nice so as most waiters in the T45 restaurant in the lobby where breakfast was served. The valets made us feel really welcome when coming in and out. Cannot say the same about the reception staff though (see “The Bad”). Our cleaning ladies were really friendly and accommodating and made us always feel welcome too.The Bad: We were just not able to set the A/C so that it wasn’t blowing directly on our bed. The staff at reception had a general arrogant attitude to them which was not very welcoming. Not only during check in, but in general with any question we had and especially at check out. This did not make us feel welcome or forthcoming at all, as if we should be lucky to be allowed to stay in that hotel with them. Not respectful.The Ugly: We booked with breakfast included and found out at check in, that breakfast was a la carte from their restaurant in the lobby T45 and that per room and day we had a limit of $74. This all sounded ok until we saw the selection available for breakfast, which for most of us was limited with regards to yoghurts and müesli, but the worst part was the price. $9 for 0.75l of water and $10 for 3 slices of smoked salmon! and on top of all this they automatically add 18% service charge to the bill which made our bill over the “free” budget we were given and we only had 1 dish each (2 adults and a child). As a matter of principle and in no way reflecting the quality of service I deducted the service charge from the bill and only signed for the price of the food and tax. However turns out at check out, that the bills were never readjusted and whole amount was charged to our room. Strangely only on one day were we charged with an additional $5 which as a matter of principle I rejected to pay (you can imagine how happy the person at reception was to discuss this with me and adjust my bill). Anyway this was finally cleared and I still don’t understand why we were not charged more, probably our daughter, who’s only 2, was given a budget of $34 herself of which we were not aware or informed. Anyway, bottom line: for the price the breakfast is not worth it. There are lots of diners nearby and even a hotel next door offering a breakfast buffet at a more reasonable price.Another ugly I found was that for the price of the room the room didn’t have any sanitary stuff in it (earbuds or cotton buds) and the quality of the soaps was three star at most. We later found out that lots of additional stuff is available on request, which is a good concept that I support, had we been informed about it during check in. ","Zurich, Switzerland",37,3.0

However my last two visits to this hotel have been less than ideal because of a receptionist by the name of DeDe. Being in the service industry myself, I know how taxing and exhausting dealing with customers can be, however when you are the front desk person for a major 4-5 star Hotel Chain you must give customers the service they are paying for. In my first encounter with DeDe, I gave her behavior a pass as we all have bad days, and I assumed this was hers. Fast forward to yesterday, when upon checking in to my room, I was told that because the hotel was sold out I would have to wait 30-40 minutes for my room, which was completely okay with me, but before I could say anything she aggressively stated “you can cancel if you want.” I was taken aback and I said that I would prefer not to. Her demeanor is unapproachable and puts customers on the defensive. As I am in the service industry myself I NEVER complain to management or even write reviews because I understand customer focused service is difficult. HOWEVER, I spoke to a manager about DeDe because customers are paying too much money to have to deal with her attitude and unprofessionalism.",brooklyn,0,3.0

We had a drink at the roof top bar, it was during the heatwave so extremely hot. Again incredible view, staff was friendly but drinks were expensive even by NYC standard. A cider and a cocktail plus tax and 10% tip was $48. I appreciate you pay for the view but as I could get almost the exact same view from our room we didn’t go back. Cleaner was friendly and almost seemed like she just snuck in when we left the room, never disturbed us or the usual knocking each morning. Not entirely sure she did anything other than made the bed and changed the towels but we didn’t really make things dirty per se so didn’t bother us. Only reason this review is a 5 star and not a 4 star is my husband contacted the hotel twice before our trip.

We've just returned from another lovely stay. I have written several reviews of this property so feel free to check them out. It was lovely to see the familiar faces of people at the hotel. It makes it feel very comfortable and safe. It makes them approachable. Many have been here for many years. I often see questions about which room is the best......Being I've stayed in a variety of them, I'll address that particular question. The highest floor that I've stayed on was 48, the lowest was in the mid 20's. I've stayed in rooms at the front of the building as well as the back of the building. I've stayed in most every category as well, as it depended on who I was travelling with.My personal favorite when I go with my spouse is the *Executive Suite as it has a separate bedroom. I'm an early riser, so it allows me to get up, make coffee, shower, watch tv, etc, without bothering my travel companion.The rooms at the front of the building have large windows. The windows on the back of the building are more limited. The higher floors are quieter (from street noise) than the lower ones. I've been in two different ""two queen beds"" rooms. One was really big with two walk in closets and a huge bathroom. Loved this room when I went with my daughter. The other was smaller and more like a regular hotel room. Bottom line on the rooms:Go with your budget and needs. If you can afford a suite, go for it. If you can't, go with your budget. How much time will you be spending in the room?? We're out most of the day. The great location allows us to pop in during the day to drop off any purchases or for a quick freshen up. Personally, I'd rather use the money to shop, visit things, etc. But if you're going to be spending more time in the room, you may want to invest in one with the best view. If your room doesn't offer the best view, there is a rooftop bar which has the most amazing view! You don't need to drink to go take a look at the view. It's totally worth the trip to the top. The beds are super comfy in all the rooms. If you require anything that you don't see, a quick call can usually fix that. Overall, we've stayed at many hotels in NYC, but we've stayed at this one the most and only this one for several years now. The room prices will vary depending on time of year, events in the area, etc. If you don't need to go during specific dates, you may want to browse the dates. At times, a few days earlier or later can make a big difference in price. I don't want to repeat what I've said in my other reviews of this property, but if you have any questions, do feel free to send me a message. I'd be more than happy to answer it if I can.","Ontario, Canada",163,4.0

Trusting the brand name Hyatt over the negative reviews, I booked a suite at this hotel for our family vacation. That was a huge mistake. Upon entering the room, my wife immediately noticed what appeared to be bodily fluid stains on the leather sofa. We called down to ask for the cushions to be replaced and were told ALL the rooms were like this. REALLY?? That's extremely sad. They offered to cover the couch with a blanket!!!! This is a Hyatt???  Then later that night my wife wanted to take a bath and called out to me in disgust. The water coming out of the facet was brown like sewage. Again, I called down to Mgmt to complain. They explained it was a plumbing issue and that all suites were having his issue in the whole building. They offered to comp us the difference between a suite and a regular room for one night and then transfer us to a regular room the next day. We eventually were able to get clearer water to come out of the facets after running them for over an hour. We NEVER trusted the water after that! The tile in the bathrooms is extremely slick. I slipped but didn't fall. My wife actually fell. It was so bad, we just made rugs out of all the tiles to cover the floor. The hotel does not provide any rugs in the bathroom. So be very, very careful stepping out of the shower or bath. Finally, we were returning from a show and stopped by to pickup a bagel for our daughter who has a sensitive atomic. We then walked into the hotel restaurant to grab a bite before returning to our room. The place was completely empty. When the waiter came over to the table, he said we couldn't have outside food. I explained the situation with my daughter and said both my wife and I would be eating. He had a pissy attitude and said we had to leave. I immediately went to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. I explained the situation both with my daughter and all the issues we have had with our stay and then asked him to speak with the restaurant to allow us to eat there. He said there was nothing he can do in a very rude manner. At this point, we were so over Hyatt and this hotel. They obviously are not keeping their property up to date (dirty furniture, worn out rugs, breaking pipes, etc..) and then to be rude to guests on top of that.

Staff - the only pleasant staff were the door people. Always with a smile and a hello. The valet parking guy (Walter?) was a real gent, chatty helpful just a nice guy. Wish he ran the place. However the reception staff. Oh my god, seriously, smile. It was bordering on rude. If I got grunted at in a grocery store I would raise and eyebrow. At a nice manhattan hotel? No. That's not acceptable. It wasn't just one, i spoke to three or four during the stay and if a fifth had sneered at me I would of spoken to the manager. I hate rudeness. Communication - prior to the visit I emailed the hotel and was ignored. Then I facebook messaged them, they assured me the email wasn't ignored but asked me to repeat the message.... Then I was ignored. Tbh, this isn't some low rent motel, it's a hyatt and that just rude and ignorant. The staff in general on reception need a kick up the arse and retraining. So so so annoyed about this. Really put a tarnish on the prep for the visit. The coffee - in the room you get a coffee machine. No milk! just these weird bags containing 6 variations of sweetner or sugar then one sachet of creamer. There's two things wrong with this. One, why the waste? I threw away loads of packets of sugar/sweetner to get to one measley creamer. It's stupid. Two.... Just supply milk, there's a fridge in the room and what's wrong with UHT sachets? In short - fabulous building, fabulous bar, fabulous greeting staff....

Same for the Empire State Building and Central Park where you can crawl, walk or jog t'ill your hearts content.The hotel is accommodating, modern but at times the design seems forced. My room was mildly over-priced and a bit on the bland side.The bath was more appealing, slightly upscale with a spacious shower equipped with a towering shower head. Towels were rough with a light sandpaper feel. I did find that the toiletries were monogrammed as Marilyn Monroe. At first I thought they were a leftover from a Marilyn Monroe wanna-a-be's stay here, but I latter realized the items were from the hotel's spa of the same name.The Centric touts it's T45 restaurant as a multi-purpose facility encompassing a cafe, bar and eatery which serves up breakfast, lunch and dinner, no doubt, in an attempt to service all the dining needs of hotel guests as well as passer-bys. The decor is modern with walls adorned with collages of vintage European maps. Lots of unusual conversation pieces dot the restaurant as illustrated by walls lined with over 8000 antique hotel key tags (if you lose your key you can take one of these). Of particular interest to me was an antique Harvard University card catalog filled with travel tips by the hotel's ""in the know"" staff (this was cool and useful). It's a matter of convenience to eat in the restaurant of the hotel you are staying at, so I did. I was very disappointed with my ""Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon"" (burnt on the edges and not fully cooked). Other attempts at a meal proved just as fatal. The T45 is in dire need of culinary help.Bar54 is a little brother to T45 and is located on the 54th floor of the hotel. It is portrayed as the highest open-air rooftop bar in NYC. It's a great place to soak up the sun in the midst of killer views of the Chrysler Building and Lower Manhattan. At night, one can view the dazzling spectacle of Times Square. This is an enjoyable spot and probably the best in the hotel, with chic interior decor and an expansive fully furnished terrace. It is ideal for a prolonged night cap along with some light pre-bedtime gourmet fare.The 3rd floor houses the Marilyn Monroe Spa. It is quite attractive and offers a full range of services that one would expect of a spa. As an accompaniment to the spa, the hotel sports a mediocre gym, again, with equipment one would associate with this type of facility. There is a 24 hour business center, if you want to work 24 hours.I was disappointed in my experience at Hyatt Centric. It is not in keeping with my thoughts about the Hyatt brand which I frequently use as my hotel of choice. With many other hotels available in the Times Square area which provide a very favourable hotel experience.....so take a pass on the Hyatt Centric..Not The Center Of The Universe.","Ottawa, Canada",122,3.0

However, upon check-out we were asked to give the payment of visiting fees and tax, which over a 5 night stay totalled to $180. We were unaware that this was not included in the price of the booking (through fault of our own), however would like to recommend workers to remind visitors of this fee upon check-in which will allow for them to budget their stay a bit better and not leave with an unwelcome surprise. In addition to this, when asking what it was we were being taxed for, we were told it was to cover the costs of water, wifi and mini bar (which consisted of bottles of water and coffee pods) which customers are told are complimentary during their stay. This is a slight contradiction as a selling point of this hotel was in fact these complimentary services but having to pay tax to cover these costs simply means that we paid for them. This may seem a minor thing to place in a survey, however my partner and I are both 21 and saved for this trip, and $180 nearly completely wiped out one of our budgets for the day. If I was travelling on my own I would not have been able to pay for my taxi to the airport as my deposit of $300 also took 2 days to go back into my account. I hope this review isn't too harsh as we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this hotel to others, it was just this handling of payment at the end of our trip which left us feeling deflated on our last day.",,0,3.0

Not a problem as there are only a dozen rooms per floor. So hallway not noisy. And we were near the ice machine and did not hear that either.4.

Definitely friendly and accommodating (not cheap, but if you're holding a meeting in Manhattan, you know that already). Only complaint is room lighting controls -- they use basically the same ones as the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central -- the rooms have ""All On/All Off"" buttons rather than individual light controls. Result is that you often can't turn lights up without first turning them all off (e.g., if two of you are in a room and one gets up to take a shower, the only way the other one can turn the lights on is to first turn off the bathroom lights!). And this is combined with motion sensors (and maybe a door sensor), with occasional fails (so I've turned on the lights, walked in, and had half of them switch off).

The facility is not complimentary, and the computer charges your credit card for computer usage by the minute and for prints by the number of copies. I ordered the prints but the printer didn't work and no prints came out. I asked a Hyatt staff member (Laura) for help. She had me re-attempt the prints, and no prints came. Now my credit card is charged for an outrageous amount of money, including for the retries. The hotel front desk says they cannot refund my money, and the printing service is actually run by a third party provider. They had me wait for several minutes for the ""manager"" to find a phone number for me. I was then handed a 1-800 number on a post-it with no name or anything. I'm supposed to spend my time calling that number to have my money returned. Also, you are charged a mandatory ""resort fee"" (known at the time of booking). However, when I went to the front desk multiple times in my 2 day stay (you shouldn't have to go there that many times in a good hotel firstly), I overheard the fee being waived left and right for others. It's some sort of scam and they're not transparent. They need 30+ minutes for the valet to bring your car (they tell you that upfront). Meanwhile, the lobby looks like a greyhound station with many guests sitting on the floor with their luggage. I think you're expected to be spending money at their bar in the meantime.A guest pays the premium to stay in a good hotel exactly for the reason of avoiding this sort of experience. If you want to spend a fixed amount of money for a scam-free pleasant stay where your hotel is not your main point of frustration, I would suggest to look for a Hilton or Marriott property.

Personally the view at the back of the hotel was not really worth paying extra for.I think the hotel is very well located in NY, it’s only half a block from the chaos that is Times Sq, haha it really is a busy place! Being on 45th street that goes down to Times Sq the road had a constant traffic jam outside, if you need a cab, go away from Times Sq to 6th Avenue.The hotel, our bathroom had a large walk in shower only, big room with the essential toiletries etc. The bedroom had a huge double bed, the linen all nice and clean. The was a largish built-in wardrobe, not so many drawers, but enough.There was a large TV in the room that randomly kept switching itself on, in the middle of one night it came on quite a few times...very annoying. Apparently our fellow travellers were told it was a hotel wide problem and that they were “working on it” No apology offered though. The room had an empty fridge, coffee and tea facilities (although no fresh milk...just powder) There was a hair dryer, iron and board.All in all the hotel was very good, sometimes the wait for the lift was long, especially if they had a private event in Bar 54 as this meant 33% of the lifts were out of commission as one was used for that event only. The hotel bars was standard NYC pricing...so high! Bar 54 had a great view, certainly worth a look!The street had a couple of reasonable bars and deli’s that were great for breakfast. You could save some money here Despite paying $3200 for the room in advance, they still managed to add some other tax to my bill at the end...it about sums up NYC to me. We went through $50 notes like confetti...take lots of money, you will need it!","Andover, United Kingdom",249,4.0

The rooms are average size for New York but thoughtfully and efficiently laid out. We stayed in room 5008 - a standard High Floor room. Walk-in shower is quite large and I appreciate the hand sprayer as well as the shelves in the shower and under the mirror for additional storage space. The closet in the room is also a good size for a NYC hotel and there are three drawers for clothing as well. Overall very pleased with the layout, amenities, and cleanliness of the room (and I am super picky). Just be aware that the bedding is European style - there is a bottom sheet and a comforter only. No top sheet. Also, the bedside light switches (which are labeled All On/Off, Reading, Mood, and Nightlight) seemed to do something different every time we pressed them. But plenty of bedside and desk top outlets to charge all your things.Now for the reasons this is a 3/5 instead of a 5/5. A couple of days before check in I received an email giving me some options to customize my stay. One of these options was a guaranteed late check out of 2pm for a fee of $50. I selected and confirmed this and added a note asking if there was any way to extend to 3:30pm. When we arrived at the hotel to check in at about 10pm on Sunday, the hotel had no record of this late checkout option. There was a little back and forth with the associate checking us in, but once we showed the confirmation he said he would ""honor the request."" Um, the request that i booked and paid for? Thanks so much.We decided to go up to Bar 54 to get a late dinner/snack and a drink and check out the view. The hostess was friendly, the interior space was very nice, and the view is stunning. But the music is loud gangster rap full of expletives and crude language (which doesn't seem fitting for the decor or the clientele we observed), the service was extremely slow and inattentive, they were out of several bar items ""because we are about to change our menu over"" (which is a BS excuse IMO), the drinks are outrageously overpriced (even adjusting for being at a rooftop bar in Manhattan), and they include an automatic 18% gratuity (which does not motivate the wait staff to actually provide good service).The next night I had dinner at T45 (lobby level restaurant) and the service and food were excellent. As a hotel guest I received 10% off my bill. The 18% gratuity was again included, but my server - Brooke - provided such great service I added additional gratuity. Unfortunately I did not receive the same level of service for breakfast the next day - the server didn't tell me about the breakfast special, I was charged $5.75 for a ""Cafe Americano"" when I ordered - and received - brewed coffee from a pot and was never offered a refill.Finally, on our check out day, I stopped by the front desk to discuss my late check out. My husband is disabled - he has one leg and uses crutches to get around - and had business meetings scheduled up to 3pm. Our car was picking us up at 3:30. He needed to change from his business clothes to his travel clothes and due to his disability he must sit down to change his pants. I calmly and clearly explained all of this to the front desk clerk and asked if there was any way we could keep the room until 3:15 or if she had any other suggestions of a way to accommodate him. She spoke to a manager and came back and just said no, they were fully committed for that night and could not extend the late check out. She said the lobby level restrooms were quite large and perhaps he could change there. I stated again that he has one leg and must sit to change his pants and asked if she had any other ideas. She checked with the manager again, who now came out and again just said ""We are fully booked for tonight. Sorry. Have to be out by 2."" I explained to him again my husband's disability and his needs and asked if he had any suggestions or ideas as to how they might accommodate him as disabled guest. Again the manager just said ""we're sold out for tonight. Sorry."" I shared with him that at other hotels in similar situations we have been offered a different, clean ""resting"" room where he could change and it would be easy and quick for housekeeping to refresh it for a new guest when we were done. And again the manager's only response was ""Sorry. We're fully committed tonight."" At that point I simply said ""We are lifetime platinum with Marriott and we will just make sure we stay at a Marriott property next time."" and walked away.Here's the thing. I understand fully booked. But it's not like all of tonight's guests are going to show up at 4pm and this was an opportunity to make a great impression on a very frequent traveler (100+ nights per year) while also accommodating a disabled guest. We were considering focusing on staying at Hyatts more often to gain status there, but now we are reconsidering that idea. If they had just taken a moment to think outside the box and help provide a solution for my husband I would have forgiven the restaurant and bar issues and this would have been a 5 star review. We would have stayed here on our next trip, but instead we will stay at the Renaissance or the Marriott Marquis or the W or the Edition (all Marriott properties within a block of Times Square).","Jacksonville, Florida",41,3.0

We choose the hotel as we had fallen in love with it when we stayed back in 2016 to celebrate our 11 year anniversary! We loved the rooftop bar and views. We knew we wanted to come back to Hyatt Centric so much so that we booked to stay almost a year in advance of our trip and then sat back and began to look forward to another trip of a lifetime. Little did we know we would come back saying that this trip was the best thing we have ever done, and that we feel that our experience and stay in Hyatt Centric Times Square was likely one that will be impossible to top, and I mean ever. We always like to meet a certain standard for accommodation on any trip, but the stars truly aligned during our stay at Hyatt Centric Times Square, and while normally the goal is to feel as special as possible on any given trip, I would go as far as saying that I felt like the most valued and special customer during our stay here. I even joked I felt like a celebrity to my partner.Prior to arriving, I emailed the hotel a few questions and my emails were picked up by Michelle and Tommasi. Both were so immensely helpful from the start, and I told them what we were travelling to NYC for and they were so patient in answering my likely seemingly never-ending flow of questions. Weeks before we even got to the hotel, I already felt so welcome and it really just added to the anticipation of our arrival.On arrival, we discovered that we had been assigned to a 52nd floor Deluxe View Corner Suite with a view of Times Square. Words can’t describe our reaction when we entered our room and saw the view the whole way to the end of Manhattan looking out our floor-to-ceiling windows. This was so immensely above what we ever expected the standard of our room to be, and unlike anything we had ever seen before. If we looked left we could see the Chrysler Building, if we looked straight ahead we could see One World Observatory at the end of the island and if we looked right and down, we were overlooking Times Square. We were speechless for a few moments and then joked, “Well, we don’t need to go up any buildings for a view now!!” I simply can’t thank Michelle and Tommasi enough for helping us achieve our goal and almost instantly of making sure that our 14 year anniversary trip was unforgettable.This hotel truly is the most spectacular and lavish hotel we have ever stayed in. The reception staff were impeccable from check-in to check-out, any questions we had they answered. A tip for your stay – do not go home without trying breakfast from the T45 restaurant at least once, but ideally do it everyday. It is exceptional and truly gets you ready for the day. I can’t say enough about the hotels location either. Aside from getting to and from the airport, we mostly walked everywhere, and felt as central as you could want. Times Square was literally steps away and everywhere up and down-town was within walking distance because of your location. We felt like we were at the epicentre of the city that never sleeps, but when we wanted to sleep, we just went 52 floors up into the sky, away from the sights and sounds and slept in luxurious comfort. Ever since we’ve left, we just wish we were back there!!The hotel TV was fabulous too, the Good Morning programs and Late Night Talk Shows became my go-to programming after a day strolling about in the heart of the Big Apple, and the best part was, we had a TV in our bedroom and one in the lounge area of our suite for our son who relaxed on his fold out sofa bed, if we ever wanted to watch something different!!The room we were in was so spacious, and the décor was so crisp, modern and clean which I completely adore. Our lounge area was so comfortable and afforded more than enough room for our son on the fold out sofa bed, while allowing us the luxury of space during the day when we folded it away. The room had a spacious fridge, lots of storage space and a wardrobe that our case and all of our clothes fit in, which really helped keep the room looking tidy all the time with any mess out of the way. My partner had access to a hairdryer and the bathroom was spectacular, with a large bath and walk in shower area, which I loved using every morning. The maid service was amazing –we were never disturbed, and every afternoon when we came back, our room was as if we were just walking in on the first day. I’m a neat freak and love this kind of cleanliness. The level of comfort in this hotel and attention to detail is just mind-blowing.We had a pretty packed to do list and got through most of what we aimed to do in NYC, all of which was walkable from the hotel. We took in Times Square, walked the Brooklyn Bridge, took the free Staten Island Ferry, and spent our anniversary afternoon on Roosevelt Island before heading to the Natural History Museum and so much more. For quick lunch bites, if you aren’t in the hotel and can’t go to T45, there is a busy but lovely deli a few doors to your left when you exit the hotel.We loved our drinks at the Rooftop Bar, Bar 54 and we also enjoyed a bottle of wine in our room because we had been assigned a room with such a spectacular view!I could write about this hotel and indeed our experience for pages and pages, but I’ll sum it up by saying that if you are visiting New York City, for the first time or have been before, I don’t think you’ve done it properly until you have stayed at Hyatt Centric Times Square. I can say with conviction that it was the best hotel that I have ever stayed in in my life. I can in addition say that the Customer Service, and indeed personal Customer Service, that we received from Michelle and Tommasi ahead of and during our stay was the most professional, exceptional and welcoming that I have ever received in my life also. While making grand claims, I will reiterate that while we always like to set a benchmark when we travel that we like to beat the next time we go away, whether it be a standard of hotel, a view, etc., I am confident that the view we had from our 52nd floor Deluxe View of Times Square Corner Suite in Hyatt Centric Times Square is likely never going to be beaten.This hotel, and the experience surrounding it, was phenomenal.When we are back in NYC, I know where we’ll be staying.Thanks you Hyatt Times Square for everything!

With that said, we definitely found our new spot while traveling into the city. The Hyatt Centric was amazing. From the time we arrived, until the time we left, we were treated like royalty. We decided to do something a bit different and take the short drive into NYC from upper Westchester for our twin daughters 16th birthdays. It turned out to be a great choice. Upon arrival the staff had balloons and a card waiting for the girls in the room. That just set the tone for a great weekend for all of us... There central location is second to none. We went to see King Kong while in town and it was a simple five minute walk. Even in the rain it wasn’t bad at all. The only locations we needed to grab a cab for was the 911 Memorial and the Sugar Shack down in the meatpacking district, which was still extremely easy, and cheep at a cost of $17.00 with the tip. Moving forward this is the only place me and my family will stay when coming down. Because of my frequent travels I’m constantly asked for the best places to stay by family and friends. I’d have to say this is one of the few locations I’d feel 100% confident about recommending.  ","Bedford Hills, New York",1,5.0

Ladies you have to learn why you work at the Reception!Pros: excellent location and like the trendy concept. Housekeeping lady (Chinese) a lovely lady who kept our room well groomed.Beds extremely comfortable and room is well sized for NYCChris (Christopher) a superstar amongst all who really embraced hospitality and helped us with I formations and a smile!Cons: Plenty which can be improved! First of all train your ladies at Reception to smile and greet when a customer pass by. Whenever I passed there was no warmth and sincerity even I greeted they were busy discussing private issues. Sorry Trendy hotels need Trendy staff who know how to treat customers and not chit chat away and give no attention to the guests. Check in equally rude a quick check in no informations no reconfirmation of booking details and Payment Details.I was booked through Agoda paid a surcharge for high floor but was put on floor 29 whilst the lowest is 25 and the highest would be about 50. An absolute scam to charge more. Fire Alarm went of at 1.35 am and even the announcement was first clear than confusion started and next day not even a apology was issued. Inquiring about dining options the Front Desk seem to care less and just give some nonsense answer rather than checking. Front Desk is seemingly preoccupied to talk about private matters, standing there messaging on mobile phones rather than taking care of their job. Absolutely appalling performance.Lastly value for money is below average. We paid 500 usd per night incl breakfast. Once you order breakfast with yoghurt and one hot dish and a fresh juice our bill exceeded more than 110 usd which is outrageous and had to pay the difference on top.Also this hotel seem to care less about environment. Even paper cups are wrapped in the room with plastic, room service served in plastic trays and plastic cutlery which is not the Hyatt environmental standard at all.Would I recommend? Perhaps no with cons outweighing and running a 5 star establishment my self I am truest shocked that the basics of Smile , Greet and Care is not prominent.","Hoi An, Vietnam",72,2.0

We just spent 4 nights at Hyatt Centric in Times Square. It’s conveniently located. It’s clean and comfortable. We would have given the place a 5-star except for a couple of things.First has little to do with the hotel itself. Times Square has gotten so crowded now. It’s really hard to get to and from the hotel by car. We drove in from Boston and the last mile literally took close to an hour. We were running so late to our dinner appointment that we had to leave our car with the hotel valet for a couple of hours. That resulted a full day charge for parking. We also had multiple ride-share cancellations because the drivers couldn’t get to the hotel. Btw, for some reason, Uber worked a lot better for us than Lyft in NYC.Second our son left his air pods on the bed before we went out on day. When we got back, it was gone. We looked everywhere for it. Our guess is that it got rolled up with the bed sheet and taken out. We contacted housekeeping. They contacted the laundry service company but nothing has turned up so far. While this was nobody’s fault and the hotel staff generally tried to be helpful, it was disappointing nevertheless.Would we stay with Hyatt in NYC again? Absolutely, but perhaps at a different location in the city.","Shanghai Region, China",0,3.0

It’s really walking distance for any play.Service is amazing specially housekeeping (they are so nice), front desk is very helpful even if they don’t look welcoming, security is amazing too and very polite. Loved that they cleaned our room every day and provided us with free bottled water everyday and also there is a mini fridge in the room. Our room had a balcony which was so nice to sit and drink with the time square view.The rooms are so big compared to many hotels in Manhattan we’ve stayed in. That was a pleasant surprise. We had drinks at the rooftop too every other night, we didn’t get to have room service but we are looking forward too on another visit.Negatives They have a computer which you can use but to browse the internet you have to pay. (Been to more affordable hotels where this is free of charge).Ask every question because no one ever told us check out was at 11am, every where we read it said 4pm (which was different from other hotels but we thought this was such a plus). We were surprised when they called us and told us check out was at 11 and it was 12 so they had to charge 120 for a late check out (little upsetting, due to the fact that no one told us or anything) they let us finish picking our stuff up at least.Overall this is a fantastic hotel, we will definitely stay here again.

We have usually had great experiences with Hyatt branded hotels, but this was our first experience with a Hyatt Centric. I contacted the hotel before booking with a few questions and received very prompt replies with all the information I needed to ensure that this would be a good hotel for our visit.We stayed for 2 nights in a 1 bedroom suite on the top floor. The views were great. The room was perfect for us since we were able to put the kids to bed early, but still order dinner to the room and have a separate living area. The room was not huge, but decent size for NYC standards. The room was clean, bathroom very large and clean, and all the right amenities (fridge, coffee with starbucks pods, safe, 2 TV's, heated flooring in the bathroom, huge soaker tub with separate shower, pullout couch in living room, lots of plugs and charging areas). The bed was great! The pullout was not (but it was exactly what we expected and perfect for the little kids once we moved them there before we took over the bed). FYI...there was no misconception about the comfort of the pullout - the general manager even offered a friendly warning that it would be good for kids, but not for two adults. He was right with his advice and honesty. In summary, this suite was perfect for 2 adults and 2 little kids (or 2 adults and 1 older kid/teenager).The hotel location was ideal for Times Square. Half a block from the main strip with views of Times Square from higher rooms. Very close to all restaurants and attractions. It's a bit loud, even on the higher floors, but Times Square is not a quiet place - I don't think you can completely avoid noise unless you stay in a different area of the City (Noise was not an issue for us for sleeping at all). The hotel itself felt new, clean, and modern. The lobby is small, as expected for a NYC hotel with small footprint. But it didn't really need to be big. 2 banks of elevators - 3 to the lower floors and 3 to the upper floors. The wait times for the elevators for us was minimal since the elevator was very fast even to our top floor room. It was good to have 2 banks of elevators since you don't end up stopping at nearly as many floors on the way up or down. The gym was big and clean as well for a quick workout.Most importantly for us, the service level at the hotel was great. Clearly this hotel is very well-managed. From the gentleman outside who arranged our car service to the airport, to the check-in and check-out staff, to the guest services, we were always greeted politely and respectfully. From experience in hospitality, I know that this is because of the culture of the hotel itself as set by the management and general manager of the hotel (he even had little cakes/gifts sent to our room for the kids, which was a really exciting special touch for them to enjoy and not something we expected). We had a small issue with the heat in our room, and had a maintenance person there within minutes to attend to it. He was also very respectful and polite when in our room. Housekeeping kept the room clean and fully stocked. Though we don't typically stay in Times Square, we would not hesitate to return to this hotel again. In fact, we would strongly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Times Square. If you value great service, cleanliness, and quality rooms, you will not be disappointed with the Hyatt Centric Times Squares. I should add that it was great for us as a family, but would be equally good for couples or business as it has all the amenities and location you need for your visit.","Toronto, Canada",115,5.0

The day before checked out we spoke to the receptionist DEDE who confirmed us the credit. On the day of check out to our surprise the same DEDE was rude, we were treated poorly like we had never been in a hotel of this level before, it presented us with the expenses of the apartment which included the rates of the bar that we had won as a courtesy and informed us that we had misunderstood, would not reimburse us and we were not entitled to the courtesy, and that there would then be an evaluation on this and sent it to me by email. We demanded to speak to the Manager ... she was polite and solicitous, excluded all fees from our apartment (but did not match the entirety of our credit for the lost order), and not at all the embarrassment and lack of treatment with the guests given by the hotel, much worse than the material loss was the disrespect and lack of concern for guest satisfaction, I will definitely not be returning to this hotel.Orlando De Lucena ( room 3902) ","Joao Pessoa, PB",2,2.0

It coincided with our sons birthday, and the hotel staff went out of their way to make it even more memorable than we planned. The hotel is situated just off Times Square - close enough to hear the buzz without being part of the chaos. We had a high floor room, which was well appointed, clean and tastefully decorated. The housekeeping staff were excellent, even handing over the $100cad note our son had managed to lose. Let's face it, how many people would've been tempted to keep it? The ground floor bar and restaurant had a good feel to it and the staff were friendly and welcoming. They treated our son to a free meal when they found out it was his birthday, and the reception staff credited us with a very generous bar tab to celebrate in Bar 54.We had read previously that Bar54 wasn't always open to guests and there might be some 'issues', but we struck lucky. As it was a warm holiday weekend we expected it to be busy, and we weren't disappointed. More than one outside table was taken up by people making one drink last an hour (no joke), but the staff were wise to this and moved them on to allow other people to sit outside. Once outside the views are great, well worth the wait, and really made the day special.To work off the excess we made use of the gym which is surprisingly well equipped.Check in and out was friendly, quick and efficient.All in all the staff, hotel and bar helped make a great end to a great holiday. We'd definitely stay here again.",southport,5,5.0

It’s a good location which great views from the roof, but that’s about it.Upon check in, I was greeted with a large charge on my credit card, which is typical for room related “incedentals”, should I throw a party and destroy the room. Nevertheless I wasn’t told about the charge beforehand, so I was kind of surprised when it showed up and I had to figure out what it was for.The room was quite hot and AC didn’t seemed to be working even though it always seemed to be on and temp reading at 65 degrees.Now onto the bed. The top of the sheet (underneath the comforter) seemed clean enough. The underside was another matter. There was bed quite a bit of hair and other nastyness underneath the sheets, so maybe it hadn’t been washed in a while.Lastly, as part of the incentives through my credit card company, I receive a $100 credit to be used at the hotel restaurant if I stay two nights or more, which I did. I probably spent that amount while I was there on food and other miscellaneous items, but upon checkout I was billed for it all and the 100 hadn’t been applied to the applicable spending. They had no idea how to fix it at the front desk and I Was told to call back and deal with the manager.At the time of this writing, the incidental amount (mentioned earlier) is still sitting on my credit card as pending even though the room was left in good order. Hopefully it never posts.As someone who travels for business, my trips are usually filled with good helping of stress, so having to deal with more things to worry about on top of everything else is not something I like to deal with.With all that being said, there are some bright spots at the hotel. The staff that greeted me day one was very nice and the lobby conditions are quite fancy. The rooftop bar is very nice, albeit highly pricy (rooftop prices, you’re paying for the view). One of the brightest spots was the restaurant downstairs which has a great selection of cocktails, beers, and food. The bartenders are very nice and knowledgeable. I wouldn’t mind spending many hours isn’t that place.","Denver, Colorado",0,3.0

Another downside is that it wasn’t even that clean, not star standard anyway. But the beds allowed for a great sleep and that certainly brings up the rating. One more plus, or downside, is that it is in peak location. In the heart of Time Square and only walks away from the biggest sights.

The ambience of the hotel and check in counter is pretty basic and plain. They don’t have buffet for breakfast, but they do have ala carte, and the choice is also limited. I personally don’t quite like the restaurant where breakfast is served. Because 50% of the place is really dark with no natural light. Unless if you are seated at the bar counter area there. The pricing is price of the food + state tax + service charge + gratitude .","Singapore, Singapore",0,4.0

I've just never had a great experience ... something is always lacking. If the room is great, then it's loud, or the staff are rude -- or vice-versa. But Hyatt Centric knocked it out of the park. Let me be clear -- their staff, especially the bellhops and front desk staff -- made the real difference. The hotel itself is very nice, but the people made the stay. My stay began on a rough note when I went to pay my cabdriver only to discover that both my debit card and my corporate card had been compromised, and I didn't have any cash. After being berated (understandably) for thirty minutes by my cab driver, I stepped into the lobby to see if they could recommend a course of action. The bellhop, who had watched the whole scenario unfold, immediately came to check on me. He and the gentleman at the front desk got the manager involved, who paid out of his own pocket and let me Venmo him some cash. After the ordeal, they consoled me a bit and made me feel much less ridiculous. I ordered room service several times while there, and those staff members went above and beyond as well. I stayed for business, but I would have been completely comfortable staying for leisure/personal reasons, as well. If you're looking for a hospitable home-base in NYC, this is the one. Super-easy to walk to 5th Ave and many of the big tourist attractions. Restaurant is quite good, and there's a rooftop bar as well.","Baton Rouge, Louisiana",11,5.0

When they were, the rooms were on different floors despite both the reservations being made at the same time and under the same name. A $75 credit was added to the room as a good gesture which was greatly appreciated. For the duration of the stay my credit card was charged double (£1,260) for a deposit, which made our stay uncomfortable as paying on my card in shops or restaurants was impacted. Didn’t feel like the reception team were welcoming, had much clue of what was going on or to do. After checkout, reception experience worsened as the team didn’t really want to know us.The T45 restaurant is good, but incredibly overpriced. 4 adult breakfast meals and a kids meal easily racks up well over $150 for a no frills meal. Understand you pay a premium for NY and being in Times Square, but not even places in Mayfair charge that much. Recommend walking up to the top of the block to the Italian cafe where they make the same food in front of you for a third of the price. Additionally, if you want room service, you’re charged $5 for delivery - could not believe this.

As I always do, I focused on getting a hotel that was close to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Bryant Park or Central Park to name a few points of interest. This past April we had been at the Sheraton Hotel and we did not dislike it at all, but with my desire to have more variety I was impressed by Hyatt Centric for being in the middle of everything and since we are loyalty member of the Hyatt organization I said: ""why not"". The hotel has a restaurant with a limited menu and a bar on the 54th floor with incredible views I did my research and immediately booked a gateway of three nights in NYC. The chosen room was the #2901, next to the elevators, I asked the front desk if there were going to be problems with noise due to the proximity of the elevators and the clerk was assure that there would be no inconveniences. We went up to the room, we settled and off we went to the city. When we return to rest, we discover that on the other side of the street there is a building with three large turbines that emit a constant noise throughout the day, return as expected to the front desk and ask in a very good way the possibility of changing rooms, the hotel is full I answer the clerk and reply: ""how weird nobody complains about the sounds of the street"" .My wife and I have the policy not to complain about things without meaning but this was a valid one and we had to stay in that noisy room for our entire stay. True, we did not ask for the manager just because I think that if someone is in front of a hotel of a firm as prestigious as Hyatt for something will be. I'm writing the same letter to the manager and I'm attaching a receipt for earplugs with the only hope that not only will that money be returned to me but that I also have the delicacy to respond with a valid reason to omit the constant noise in hours that should be used to sleep.

It kept turning itself on every 60-90 minutes both day and night. That made trying to sleep an awful experience. Bright light and loud sound woke us up continuously. When we spoke with the front desk, they said that the problem was hotel-wide, and they would have an engineer disconnect the TV. The engineer NEVER showed up. Eventually we figured out how to disconnect the TV ourselves. Later the front desk was telling people that the problem had been fixed. That was not true as people continued to complain about the TV turning itself on.Housekeeping was okay. They could do better. Housekeeping took our face towels and never replaced them.

Housekeeping was exceptional and always checked to see if we required any further supplies.

The restaurant was amazing, we ate there twice during our stay.We went up to Bar 54 to see the view from the rooftop.

I talked to them in advance about arranging Thanksgiving meal and possible upgrade for our room as I’m at Hyatt Explorist. It took 3 separate emails to finally get someone from the hotel to contact me back. Once I did hear back from them they were helpful. The problem starts as we got closer to the date I tried to speak with manager again who was suppose to keep me updated if any other rooms opened up. I never heard back from him and in fact was able to do the upgrade myself online. Come check in day which check in time is 4:00 we arrived early and were told our room wasn’t ready. We understood but come 4:00 when we came back the room still wasn’t ready and it was almost 5:00 before we could get to our room. The room was nice, suite on top floor. The only problem was the A/C and heater. It was very cold that week so if the thermostat was set to 76 it was blazing hot, if you put it down to 75 it was freezing cold. There was no comfort zone. We just marked that up as it was very cold in NYC that week and perhaps it was messing with the room temp. On our arrival in the room one nice touch they had was a special gift for us with a picture frame and a special note telling us if we needed anything to get them a call. It had a ladies name and direct phone number. That was very thoughtful we thought. In fact there was something my wife needed and called this person on our second night. She left a VM but we never heard back from this person. Why tell us to call you then not respond? Very frustrating. The staff in general was very good at the property. The conciere’s were ok. The first person we spoke to us gave us a great Pizza place near us to have lunch. Another concierge didn’t seem to know nearly as much as the first one. One thing consistent with both of them was it took sometimes 15-20 minutes to even talk to them. There was never more then 1 person there at a time and there was always several people in line to talk to them. Overall the stay wasn’t that bad but for a 4 star hotel at that price per night for a suite and me being an Explorist I expected much more out of Hyatt.

Our room had a generously sized bathroom with large bathtub in addition to a nice shower and about a seven foot long shelf under the mirror that fit all our toiletries for the four of us.

It was a nice 15 minutes diversion but not super special so don't worry if you miss it. We had good experience with the elevators and generally did not wait more than 60-90 seconds to be picked up.

We wanted to secure rooms for arrival and departure and didn’t really want to go through the stress of haggling half day rates for our first and last night. So I just went ahead and booked full nights for those 2 days.Everything went well until we checked out. I was surprised that I was being charged an EARLY CHECKOUT penalty of 1 night, despite me releasing a fully paid room half a day early. The front desk officer, Dede, was explaining to me like I was a child that it’s similar to me breaking a contract. That there will be penalties for breaking a contract. She was doing this in a tone that was condescending, she made me feel like I was trying to get one over their hotel. Based on my standards, she is not suited to be a front desk officer in a customer service centric position.I asked for the manager, John, who basically said the same thing. That I was breaking a contract. I explained again to him, as I did with Dede, that I paid for the 10days! I wanted the room for 10days, I paid for 10 days, where is the violation there? Told them they should actually be happy as they can sell the paid for room again, at least half day if it, to someone else. He made some concessions and charged me half of the penalty. I accepted it as my time and effort, I was tired already and was preparing for the long flight home, was worth more than the $150 (full penalty was $299) they were charging. I was fighting for principle and just wanted to get the message across that this penalty/policy, was IMPRACTICAL, ILLOGICAL and was unfair to the customer specially in a case like mine.This negative experience with the property unfortunately was a terrible ending to an otherwise really great trip.And what I couldn’t understand was that they could not even give concessions to a long staying guest (10 nights!) and just waive the stupid penalty off.

I only have 2 issues; 1) I wanted to do something really special and since I am not from New York, I called and spoke to a very nice Lady in the Sales Office and she gave me the name, number, and email address for their VIP Manager. I called & emailed the VIP Manager and I never received a call or even an acknowledgement email. (Not Good);2) Check-In: When my niece went to check in, the GSR Michael said that my CC was declined, and this is what I didn't want to happen. That morning on Friday November 2nd, I called and spoke to a very nice GSR Gloria and advised her that I wanted my Auntie Girl to be able to check in without any issues and she suggested that I complete the Credit Card Authorization form and she even told me what to check off to make sure everything went smoothly. I completed the form, and emailed it back to her, then I called to make sure they received it, they ran my credit card and she said everything is good to go. Fast forward to around 6 something my niece calls me while I am on the road traveling to New York, and says that the guy is saying your credit card declined, and I said NO it was not declined, so she puts me on the line with Michael and he doesn't listen to what I am saying, because if he would have then he would have taken the extra step and investigated a little bit more, but he was not listening to me. Then I ask to speak to a Manager and she gets on the phone, and proceeds to tell me the same thing, and I proceed to tell her the same thing that I have told Michael 3 times; all I was offered was excuses and no one putting me on hold to say, ""If you could please give me a minute let me double check just to make sure""; but no one did that. I was completely irate, and I work in the Hotel Industry, and know that the first thing you do is 1) Listen to what the customer is saying; 2) You acknowledge the issue; 3) You do your research so that you can resolve the issue. Then finally after a 10-15 minute (maybe longer) phone call, the manager says Oh, I do see that the card has already been charged...Ummmmm...yeah you do and if you would have listened, the problem could have been rectified without me having to become frustrated. Then I was offered a $50 Food & Beverage credit....REALLY? Okay, if that is the best you can do. Either way, my niece was definitely surprised and I was happy. Everything from the Valet to the young lady that checked me in when I arrived that evening was wonderful. The Restaurant Manager was great, food was great. My only issue(s) was with my niece not having a ""smooth"" check-in, and not having a follow-up call from the VIP Manager.",,1,4.0

The location is perfect because the shows we took in were between 8-12 minute strolls. Definitely plan on staying there again in late Dec- Jan to celebrate a few big birthdays with friends.",,0,5.0

Thank god! I don't know how I would have killed 6+ hours after a red-eye.- Cannot stress how close this hotel is to Times Square and the theatre district; every theatre we went to was within a 10 minute walk (AT MOST!), the hotel is right off the main drag but far enough away that you're not stuck in that crazy crowd situation- Clean room, amenities replenished every day, rooms seemed to be clean pretty promptly (even days where we didn't leave our room until early/mid afternoon)Cons:- Not a fan of the $25/day destination fee but this seems inevitable with a lot of NY hotels nowadays- Minor quibble, but the one wall plug that is close to the work desk is mostly blocked by the side of the desk (which can't move) so I couldn't plug my MacBook in to work- Hotel is a bit pricey for the size of the room, but honestly, for the location and maintenance, I can't complain that much.","Vancouver, Canada",32,5.0

The reason we initially booked an apartment was because we are a family with two teenagers. We wanted to stay all together. Even though we booked the Hyatt Centric at the very last minute, they were able to give us two rooms next to each other in an alcove off the main corridor. Even though they didn't connect it was great to have our kids so close. The rooms were modern and clean and provided us with a great, comfortable base to explore NYC from. We loved started our day with breakfast in the hotel's outdoor eating space. We also loved ending out day with a drink in the beautiful rooftop bar, although the kids couldn't go there because you have to be over 21. The absolute best part of this hotel, is the location.

Lots of traffic in the hotel is starting to show in the cleanliness and general maintenance- House keeping was bit hit and miss, one day it looked like it was half done and the cleaning towels were left in the room - very random. They also need to use less bleach as it leaves a strong smell in the room afterwards- Sheets, pillows and towels are all showing their age. We did ask for additional pillows ( they only provide two on a king bed) and a blanket but only the pillows arrived. Pillows were awful - way too soft even with two of them- Air conditioning was so loud and rattled even when placed on eco and low fan - in end had to turn off whilst sleeping- Gym TV on equipment no longer works so you can only bring own ipad or if u are a US citizen log in to your hulu etc account which seems strange for a hotel with international visitors- On check out no asking whether stay was any good, did we need to store luggage etcHotel is becoming more of a budget ( big groups and lost of turn over) hotel rather than the Hyatt brand which tends to be more personalised service.

I figured it was a hotel policy and not a housekeeping error. It was too late and I was too tired to complain about the state of my bed. I told the front desk the next morning and they didn't really seem to care.Late night security is abrasive. I get the reason for having them (the elevators don't have a card security). Many people have mentioned this prior to my stay, and security was still abrasive. So hey management, when you respond to this saying ""you'll work on it,"" I won't really believe you until there's notable changes in the reviews, sorry.This hotel looks a lot newer than say, Hyatt Grand Terminal, and overall wasn't THAT bad, but considering it's proximity to Times Square (the noise wasn't an issue, just the foot traffic to get around is a nightmare of course), the subpar service and cleanliness, I'll look for a different hotel to at in the future.","San Francisco, California",0,3.0

I’m not of the mindset that every guest should be treated like a king or that every aspect of every experience is going to be perfect. When I stay at a Hyatt or other higher end chain hotel I do hold them to the standard at which they advertise themselves. Generally, I look for a few key indicators to tell me how a hotel really approaches their responsibilities of providing guest service and providing a level of guest experience commensurate with their brand. First, are the rooms and common areas of the hotel clean? In this case yes, even the grout lines in the shower were free of mildew( a common problem in my travels). How are the towels? That may seem silly but to me the quality and condition of the towels gives great insight into the quality expectation of management. In this case epic fail. The towels were way past their useful life. All of the 4 bath towels were frayed, with big pulls and had lost any hint of softness from what must have been 1000s of washings. What about guest service? I always forget something when traveling, usually a toothbrush or razor. This time I asked for a razor. It never came. I went down to the desk and 2nd time was a charm because it was in my room when I returned.Next room service. This is always great. The menu states that the kitchen is open until 11pm. I called at 10:53pm and was informed they were closed. Sorry, at a Hyatt that is a fail. I know it’s annoying but at the very least offer something to a hungry traveler if they are calling during your stated operating hours even if it’s a very limited offering. Checkout. Did they ask me how my stay was? Nope. This is the trademark of a hotel that gets a lot of complaints. I’m not saying that is the case here but asking every guest about their experience is guest service 101. It should be as 2nd nature as breathing for a front desk employee. Another weird thing about the Centric brand, according to the front desk they don’t believe in top sheets. The beds only have a bottom sheet and a duvet. This grossed me out a little because it makes me put a lot of faith in housekeeping that they change that duvet cover after every guest. Also,as someone who runs hot, I like a sheet not a duvet. Generally this was a fine hotel but honestly I would stay elsewhere in the future. If you do stay here request a high floor. I was in 710 and opening the curtains was a dark and depressing experience. ","Wayne, New Jersey",8,3.0

We were celebrating our youngest child's high school graduation and our vacation included her surprise gift of seeing Hamilton at Richard Rogers Theater. What a great visit! The hotel is perfectly located for travel with young adults. We were not interested in Times Square, but knew they would want to see it. We wanted to be near Broadway in order to walk to Hamilton when that incredible time finally came (Hamilton was definitely worth the hype-best production I've ever seen!), but did not want to deal with the noise and Times Square traffic. Since Broadway is by Times Square, I had found investigating which hotel to select presented quite a challenge. The Hyatt Centric proved to be the perfect location. We had great access, with little walking to a couple of main subway stations, providing access to all of the historic sites we did want to include in the trip. We had a large room; city view on a high floor. It was spacious for New York, clean, and well appointed. The cleaning staff was very professional and polite and we enjoyed leaving our room in their hands, which made those late night returns to our room pleasant as it was clean and welcoming, thanks to them.

Overall, the front desk team was mostly quite helpful and the doorman was super friendly. The compact size of their front desk is a challenge and that does cause delays on occasion. There were a few disappointments which are the reason that we couldn't give a five circle review. First, the lobby area is extremely tight. When we were waiting for our car to arrive to take us to the airport, there were several people that had taken up all of the seating so our entire exhausted family was left standing with our luggage for about half an hour against a wall next to the front desk. On a few occasions we needed to utilize the lobby restrooms and each time they were in terrible condition. It is obvious that they have quite a bit of traffic and they are simply not cleaned often enough to keep up. Finally, we found it odd that the property does not provide a top sheet for the bed. We had to go to the lobby to request one, but it was a bit alarming when we arrived late at night and didn't have one.

The bathroom was a little smaller than the ones in the deluxe view versions and if you wanted to take a bath you would have to enter through the shower- a very weird set up.

The room itself was lovely, amazing view down to Times Square and well serviced.Unfortunately the staff are horrendous - definitely the rudest and most uninterested hospitality I have ever had from hotel staff. Do NOT expect any help with information or bookings from them, the guy on the desk was super unhelpful and only interested in pushing one company (for the open top bus)- which turns out you could get a better deal buying from one of the street vendors straight outside the hotel.On another day we wanted to go out to the Woodbury outlets - he told us the only way to do this was via bus (the same company he recommended above)and it would be $42 - we took his advice and went to catch the bus - however the was a HUGE line and no seat available, was on a first come first served basis with no notice given to times booked on your ticket. We did some googling and got a private shuttle the next day for $49 instead. This is something hotels should help you with - especially one that charges what this one does. On the positive side, if you want to be right in amongst it all the location of this hotel couldn’t be beaten. We enjoyed the rooftop bar (a little $$ but that’s just NY) and the service from the staff there was great!

Throughout my stay, I was greeted by them each time I arrived back at the hotel. They provided great local tips, and great service, including arranging car service back to the airport for my departure. Security - I appreciated the presence of hotel security in the lobby, requesting to see my room key, prior to being able to go to the elevators. My room was modern, and was very clean. The views of midtown were fantastic! Location is convenient to multiple subway stations - each about 2 blocks away. Very close walking distance to numerous attractions - Top of the Rock, Radio City Music Hall, Times Square, etc. Bar 54, an indoor bar with a rooftop patio, is located on the 54th floor.

It's very touristy, crowded, and tacky, eventhough it's a must-visit for first timers. Lot's of homeless people and panhandlers on the streets as well - not that I'm not sympathetic, but this is just something non-locals won't be used to seeing.The hotel had a very small plain lobby that was always busy due to the location and restaurant, and the rooftop bar.

Then, it went downhill. Why? Security for one. They have a lovely rooftop bar. That ANYONE can get to in the main hotel lobby elevators. So, if someone follows you back to the hotel, they can get a pass to the hotel bar and get immediate unfettered access to the entire hotel! HUH? In this day (and in Times Square) is that really a good thing? The security would ask me for my key before I went up, but then I would share the ride up with people who were not staying at the hotel and could walk off the elevator at any floor. Second - I found old fruit under the drawers area by the TV. Me thinks it's not so clean then. The lobby was very, very, very small. There was one seat in the entire lobby that was in a very busy area. That was it. Room was nice, bed was a good night's rest and bathroom was lovely. That is the only reason I gave the hotel 2 stars.I would not recommend staying here with kids because of the security issue and club people going up and down the elevator every day.

The night manager asked for our ID, looked at the computer and then disappeared leaving us standing in the lobby for 25 minutes. After insisting to the security guard that she ask the manager to come back out she returned and said, sorry, no room at the inn!! The hotel double had booked. I insisted that she must be mistaken since we had prepaid but she was equally insistent that there would only be 2 rooms available the following day. I spoke to Agoda who were equally shocked and after another 30 minutes (now 3:30am)we were transferred to the Grand Hyatt Central. This hotel is a three star (although ranked higher) hotel, not well maintained with dirty carpets. Still at 4:00 am, with 3 hours to sleep, beggars can't be choosers.The next day we returned unfortunately to the Hyatt Centric. The room was on the 6th floor and the windows paper thin, so we consequently heard every car, ambulance and noisy drunk as if they were in the same room. Double glazing obviously wasn't in their budget, neither was maintaining the room, training the staff, or cleaning the stains from the carpet. The walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbours, cough, and flush the toilet......The only redeeming feature in the Hyatt Centric is the soft pillows. Other than that, take my advice from a person that spends half their life in a hotel, and do not book here if you want peace and quiet, modern luxury and a clean neighborhood. If you want to stay at a Hyatt then go to the Andaz. ","Rome, Italy",29,1.0

The male staff who checked us in informed us that our rooms are connected (note we didn't ask at the time when he told us that but at the end of the process, we wanted to double check and he confirmed a second time that our rooms are indeed connected). And it turned out when we went to our rooms, the rooms weren't connected. We then had to go down to the lobby and ask what was up. Another male staff at the counter explained the room that was supposed to be connected was occupied but he would check with his manager what he could do. He went into the room right next to the counter and didn't come out for another 10 minutes. When he came back to the counter, he informed us the best thing he could do was to upgrade us to different rooms with a fee. It's ridiculous how bad the service is with the false information and wait time. It's not even a category 1-4 hotel....but a 6. What's more annoying is that the hotel has 4 elevators but each one is small and always takes over 5 minutes to arrive. The hotel is basic but overpriced.

It went quickly and they will hold your bags for you. I requested an early check in and they were able to accommodate me at noon! The location was ideal! It easy access to the center of Times Square without all of the noise and flashing lights. Everything is at your fingertips including Starbucks across the street. Communication was constant via email and phone notifications. The elevators are speedy and you don't have to wait long.The room was very spacious, clean and modern. The floor to ceiling windows brought in so much light and gave quite the view. I also want to mention the air quality. It wasn't stuffy and the air conditioning was steady all night. (A lot of other places tend to shut off in the middle of the night.)

So, Hyatt Centric Times Square became our night refuge that way there. Upon checking in the receptionist kindly reminded me about my deliveries which I’d ordered from Amazon – some vinyl and CD’s – the preparations for the next Hard Rock trips. Many thanks for that, ‘cause I’d almost forgotten of them...The next mandatory stage at Manhattan hotels – the first imagination of a view. And it was fantastic with a piece of Times Square from a 30+ floor!Our try to have a short walk failed as it’d been practically impossible to hew a passage through crowd around Times Square, and then we recalled about a bar at the hotel’s 54 floor. Once there we took the point that our room view wasn’t seriously worse. It made us go downstairs to the hotel’s T45 bar & restaurant where we spent a marvelous hour sipping Bourbon (myself) & Chardonnet (my wife).The next morning, we were permitted for a late check out having had an opportunity for one more (and more successful) walk near Times Square – due to too early time for the most of the rubbernecks...Good relax, even it was too short – just between the flights.","Moscow, Russia",60,5.0

The three of us in a king suite with a pullout sofa. We were on the 49th floor in a corner room. We could see Times Square and the NYE ball if we twisted our head a bit. Overall, our stay was good here at the hotel. We would stay here again. PROS:Great location! Half block to the chaos of Times Square....everything was walking distance. You can either walk, cab or catch the subway to where ever you wanted to go. We walked to Central Park, 5th Avenue shopping, Times Square, Lyric Theatre (and even from Battery Park- which I don't really recommend unless you are up to it physically but it can be done). Comfortable beds. The king size bed was comfortable and the pullout sofa was decent for a pullout. Two TV's and space to your own: we traveled with our 11 year old son, which had the pleasure of taking over the living room/pullout bed area. He loved that he had his own space. He also loved the fact that he could decide whether he wanted the blackout curtains closed for the night or to keep them open with all the Times Square lights glowing into his area all night long. This added space helped tremendously. Quiet floors: limited number of rooms on each floor. I think we counted about 11 rooms on our floor. We didn't here a peep from anyone on our floor, in fact it was kind eery. I know there were other occupants because we saw housekeeping cleaning the rooms daily. Housekeeping: they were very patient with us. There were days when we asked them to come back and clean the room later (several times). They were never put off and they always made sure to come back when it was convenient for us. Bellmen WALTER: he definitely made our stay. In actuality, he was the only staff member that went out of his way to take the time to talk to us a bit. He was awesome! During our conversations with him, he learned that we were planning on departing the day of the Puerto Rican parade. He made a special effort to let us know that we should try to get out of the city early to avoid the street closures and added traffic. He arranged for a driver to take us the airport that morning with no problems. So glad for WALTER and his helpfulness. It was nice to know we could come down and get advice from him on a daily basis. Bottles of water: loved that the hotel provided bottled water as part of the $25 per day charge credit. Housekeeping was intuitive enough to know how many people were in the room and left enough for at least 1 bottle per person per day in the room. They also replenished daily without us having to ask which was nice. 10:30am tour of 54: This hotel has a wonderful rooftop bar. Unfortunately, if you are staying here with kids the families can not take advantage of this night time view. BUT, hotel management does offer a FREE daily tour at 10:30am to take families up to the rooftop bar to see the view. The view is amazing! I would recommend taking advantage of this opportunity. The management staff leading the tour let us take our time and was not pushy about the time we spent up there. Cons or Opportunity for Improvement:Concierge: Not helpful at all! Tried to get help from them twice and after that decided that WALTER the bellmen was more helpful. Both days that I spoke to the concierge the employees both seemed to busy to stop and speak with me (although there was no other guests at the concierge desk). We did happen to get one concierge staff to give us a tip on where to rent bikes for Central Park, although disappointedly when we arrived at the bike rental company they asked how we learned of them. We told them our concierge staff referred us. They then asked if the concierge gave us any coupons for the bike rental (which is what I am assuming is the standard process) and we said no they did not give us any coupons. The bike rental company was nice enough to give us a discount anyway but it made me feel the concierge desk at the Hyatt Centric was subpar at the least, and really was not a resource for it's guests. The 2nd interaction was me inquiring about he REDBUS tours. Since I did not want to be bothered by all the people no the street trying to sell us the tours I asked our concierge. He simply told me ""well we can sell you tickets here if you like."" No further information or conversation at all. Hmmm....are we bothering you to do your job? I felt both interactions with the concierge staff were short and curt. Both staff members on different days did not seem like they wanted to go out of their way to help in any way at all. Very disappointing to say the least.Marilyn Monroe Spa: warming.....I would think twice and maybe a third time before booking anything at this spa. We have stayed and been guests at many resorts with high end spas (ex: Mandara Spas at different locations). The spa was disgustingly dirty (dirty towels laying all around the locker room), the front desk clerk very rude and lacks customer service training. My husband booked an appointment with the spa the day before we were departing. We wanted to use the spa credit the hotel gives for the $25 per day charge. Unfortunately, the whole situation was a disaster. My husband's appointment was for 11am. He arrived and checked in with the front desk clerk around 10:45am. He was shown to the mens locker room by the front desk clerk, never given a key for the lockers, a robe or flip flops and was not given any tour or directions of the spa. He went into the sauna for a few minutes and around 11;05am he decided to go see if they were ready to take him for his 11am appointment (since in other spas they have an attendant come and get you when the therapist is ready and no one seemed to come around 11am). When he finally found someone- the front desk clerk, he was told by her that ""they had been looking for him and since he was in the shower (not) she did not feel comfortable coming in the locker room to get him."" ??? It was now about 11:15am and he was told by her that his appointment was cancelled and he was going to be charged for the appointment as a no show. WHAT!!??!! Really? I ended up coming to the spa about this time and we requested to speak to the Spa manager (which was a male employee). He reiterated what the front desk clerk told us but after some discussion decided that we would not be charged for the appointment- wow! We then asked, do you not have a male employee to come alert male guests in the locker room that the therapist is ready for their appointment. The manager told us that the staff need to come get him (the manager) to go into the locker room to alert the guests their therapist is ready. REALLY? This was never done. In the end, we ended not being able to use our $100 credit for the spa (which was a waste). The hotel really needs to do some monitoring of the spa and please do not include them in the $20 per day credit for the $25 per day charge. It really made our stay at your hotel tainted. I did mention our situation to the front desk upon checking out and they were appreciative that we told them but it stopped there. They did not offer a credit on our room for the inconvenience. Very disappointing. $25 per day credit: useless except for the bottled water. I don't think we drank $25 worth of bottled water per day. Please re-think your credits for this charge. Most of it was just fluff and with the debacle we had at the spa....we did not recoup our credit for this $25 charge. Please take a look at other hotels in the area and see what they are doing. Most provide a $25 food credit per day from the hotel and/or bar.Shower: well let me just say this.... please pay careful attention to the shower. If not you will end up with a bathroom floor completely flooded! I had read reviews about this so did not feel as stupid when it happened to me. It actually is a flaw in the design of the shower door. After the first time it happened, I paid closed attention to this and it still happened minimally a second time. Design of hall/closet/bedroom door and bathroom door: we had a corner room so not sure if this is applicable to all rooms but the hallway area between the closet, bathroom and bedroom is ridiculous. There is one barnyard door which alleviates some of the problem but otherwise it is a mess. The doors all hit each other and it is impossible to move around that area when one of the doors is open. Not a deal breaker but it is a ""what were they thinking when they designed this?' moment over and over again during our 5 right stay. Elevators: kind of a mess! Some elevators only go to certain floors so pay attention. It seemed that everyone needed the elevators for floors 25-54 so long lines and confusion almost every night. My son actually ended getting stuck in the elevator doors because of the confusion of people cutting the line to get an elevator and then half of our family getting on the elevator (because we didn't want to be rude and cut the elderly ladies off). Not sure how to fix this problem but something management might want to pay attention to especially at night when more patrons are using the higher floor elevators. Overall, good hotel and location. Loved that they offered suites in this area which seems rare for hotels in Times Square. Recommend that most of the staff go through some customer service training (maybe Walter and housekeeping can be the lead trainers) to meet the standards of the hospitality industry.","Oakland, California",144,4.0

We were on the 34 and 38th floors--the view was not great but the rooms were very quiet--short hallways and few rooms on each floor so really nice and quiet to sleep. The elevators are fairly fast so not long time waiting.

Other times, , you just feel like you’re walking into Sephora. I’m surprised I wasn’t handed a basket. Ugly: worst WiFi that is unsecured ( despite what the offsite IT) even after login. The Destination Fee is simply an abomination in light that the property offers nothing akin to a resort. Calling it a destination fee is abusive. No decent WiFi? Only unsecured? How about matching the Grand Hyatt in this regard. In room amenities must be called down for. Not hospitality. No robes, slippers, tacky toiletries. 28.69? Full disclosure- I’ve been at this property before when it lacked the added Centric. I am starting to think that the adding of the suffix and concept advice was bad bad. It was just the Hyatt Times Square and if memory serves, the front desk was a mess. This time, check in was great. Straightforward. Likewise, my departure was handled well. The room was quiet for the most part and that is a huge plus. The bathroom has an overhead shower which I guess is another reason why management thinks it has the prerogative to charge a Destination Fee. The WiFi or lack of security obliterates that notion. Ditto no luggage rack. Hyatt Centric believes that fruity water in the lobby which, my goodness is a mess, makes the hotel spa- like. You can’t be a 4.5 star wannabe if your lobby is not welcoming or classy. Forget it. Be the best 4 star. Start there. The location is neither a plus or a detriment because it is ideal equally as it is problematic at best or horrific at worst. The riff raff buzz of tourists, traffic and noise is just well it depends. If you a from a quieter part of the world, you may love it. Maybe. Enough to pay through the nose? Hospitality is just a basic in any hotel. Forget a four star or above. The restaurant should be treating its hotel guests, as guests, not trying to close out their checks so that an employee can leave early. Bartender seems great but all of a sudden, someone has to leave and well.... the gentleman next to me had to ask if he could still keep ordering.. poor thing. It was 8:30pm, not two am in Times Square...They slapped an automatic Service charge for tip and wow, that is insulting if you are sitting alone at the bar reading. I was told that I could put that charge on the room to rush me even more...nice. I did speak to someone who listened but who knows. The Hyatt Centric is convinced of its own quality and that is inexcusable today. There are better three stars out there with better training and professionalism. Even for a Hyatt, this was lacking in quality or the perception of it. How tourists pay this fee is just embarrassing and again, abusive. Go to Europe and experience great service and you will soon learn that hotels like The Hyatt Centric Times Square are mediocre at best and just another tourist trap.

The front desk staff was very welcoming (and funny!) and the check-in was quick. I was pleasantly surprised to see a vigorous room key check for those people entering the elevator lobby (in the evening, not all day), which added a nice level of security. The location can't be beat - easy access to everything! The rooms are really nice, well-decorated and the bathroom is great. Plenty of counter space, the shower has a huge shelf for toiletries and there is even a leg rest in the shower for shaving. My only negative comment is that the bathroom is fully stocked with single-use amenities, which I suggest should be available only on request, in order to try and help the environment. There is a recycling bin in the room, which is great, and the lighting seems energy efficient, so that's all great. We heard hardly any street noise, so the windows are really good at soundproofing.

Also, from what I’ve read, NY hotel rooms tend to be pretty tiny but we had a king city view room and it was a great size for my fiancé and I! It was also a very nice, clean room and we were very happy with it. We were the second room from the elevator, which we could hear going up and down fairly regularly, but it was not loud enough to bother us and was well worth the trade-off for how fast the elevators were! We never waited more than a minute or two for our elevator which is pretty impressive. Check in and check out were also very simple.

I was a little nervous as you don't know what you get until after booking- but I could have not asked for a better hotel! The location was perfect- in heart of Times Square and a few blocks from Radio City where we attended a concert. It looks brand new, great decor, ambiance and aromatherapy from the moment you walk in the lobby. I believe it was one of the managers KiKi who checked us in, and I told her it was my mother's birthday and she had no idea what had been planned all weekend including the stay at Hyatt. My mom was surprised when a short while later they delivered a nice little gift bag with a handwritten note and also comped our breakfast the next day. Our room was beautiful and bed super comfy, with a nice partial view of Times Square.We enjoyed a delicious breakfast at their restaurant T45. After we caught the morning tour of their rooftop, which is the highest in the city and has amazing views. We were guided by another manager, John as the rooftop doesn't open until the afternoon. They have a large holding room for luggage which allows you to enjoy exploring the city more after checkout without having to lug around heavy baggage.Upon leaving a custom umbrella I had left wasn't found, so John took my info and would call me to pick up later. When I returned to my place, my mom realized she left her purse with valuables in a drawer in our room. I called and was immediately connected with housekeeping who had it safe in their possession. We took a uber ride back into the city, and John was waiting out front to hand me the umbrella and purse with all its contents still there, so we wouldn't have to get out of the car or wait for assistance.I have worked in customer service and tourism for several years before, and I have to truly say that from the moment we arrived until our departure we had an incredible experience and every staff person we encountered were friendly, welcoming and professional. My only complaints are that the check-in/check out process was a bit slow, with it being a busy time should have more hands on deck, and that there aren't any vending machines.

The hotel is on a side street so there is no view. It is also a boutique hotel so other than the rooms and a small restaurant and lounge there is nothing more to this place. My room was very clean but the room is nothing to write home about and somewhat small. Overall a good experience ,"Oakland, California",2,3.0

It closed one night at 11 pm. That night I was working with the laptop at the bar. I went to the toilet and on my way back, they closed the front door and did not let anyone else in anymore. The doorman didn't let me in also, and he very rudely told me, The bar is closed !! I had to get the manager and told him that my laptop is still at the bar and I am still working there. Nobody told me that the bar closes already at 11 pm. Obviously I was not happy when you get treated like that. I am not an enemy I was a client of the hotel.6.

A nice little bonus was that our rooms were nice and high, 38th floor, which gave us great views. The room was a good size very clean and well maintained, the same goes for the rest of the hotel. Staff were very helpful and good security in the building. The roof top bar 54th floor has impressive views, but it does come with a hefty bar price list.

I must say, this was one of the best hotels I have stayed at for work.

I spoke to Ritchie when I first arrived, and he was so professional, friendly and welcoming. During my stay, the staff was always ready to assist with any questions and requests that I had.RoomMy room was nice, tidy and spacious. A nice big bed, with a good mattress and pillows. During my whole stay, I slept like a baby every single night. I had a room on the 39th floor, and I had a lovely view. The room had all the necessities; a mini fridge, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, coffee machine, and a small safe. And more, but these are the least basic things that I want and need in a hotel room.The desk had several power outlets, as well as an adapter for the UK/IRE plugs, which was super helpful.One thing I particularly liked, was that there were light switches/buttons placed at the convenient places in the room, that would control the lights in the whole room. I could control the lights when I was in bed, by just pressing a button next to the bed.BathroomThe bathroom was great, with a huge mirror. It had the basic toiletries: shampoo, conditioner, body was, facial cleansing bar, body bar (no toothpaste though).I loved the rain shower head in the shower, and there was also a regular shower head if you’d prefer that. The shower design is great, because of the glass door, the bathroom floor doesn’t get wet.GymLovely 24hr gym on the 4th floor, it had plenty of cardio machines, and a free weight area. Small towels were provided, as well as a water cooler in the corner.There were some machines to train the legs, shoulders, back, and chest as well.LocationIt doesn’t get any better than this. When you go out of the doors, it’s literally 30 seconds to Time Square. I had to be in the Hippodrome building daily, which was only 3-4 minutes away for me, so that was perfect.From the hotel, you could get anywhere easily, either by walking or by taking a subway/metro.

Hyatt had our contact details and had months of opportunity to let us know that this additional charge would be added. We were under the impression that water and wifi were complimentary as mentioned in our booking however little did we know we were paying a hefty fee for this. we contacted Hyatt regarding this following our stay as we felt it was unfair to be charged such a fee with no forewarning not even at check in, as this may have altered our decision to stay.

I contacted the hotel before and they said it wouldn't be a problem, when we got there however, they really did go out of their way to ensure he was well catered for. They made him gluten and dairy free pancakes every day and even made him some choc chip and blueberry muffins, which were delicious. I have to give a special shout out to Syed Hussain (one of the waiters), he was so friendly and helpful and fully understood the seriousness of my son's allergies, he made us feel very welcome and comfortable that we could eat there without any issues.

The building is a high rise and is a bit tough to see from the street because the sign is behind some of the other signs on the same street. Within 2 blocks are several subway stations so you are close to everything at that point.The hotel has 54 floors serviced by 3 elevators. Upon entry there is a bar/restaurant off the lobby where you can get breakfast, lunch or dinner in addition to a bar. Around the corner from the front deck is the Concierge who were very helpful. There is a bar on the 54th floor with an amazing view from the outdoor patio that you should take in. There is also a work out facility and spa but we didn't use either.The checkin process was relatively quick. They have three computer stations and were good about getting people processed. Once we had our key we went up to our room. After getting settled and going out to tour around Times Square we came back to get ready for dinner. That’s when we heard it. Because we were right beside the elevator, the vibration and buzz was noticeable not just in our room but the room next to us. After a discussion with the front desk, they moved us to another room on another floor further away from the elevator. Thank you Hyatt!Our room was a single king room with a TV, safe, small refrigerator, iron, ironing board. The bathroom had a single sink, walk in rain show with a hand shower also, makeup mirror and hair dryer in addition to the usual complementary shampoo, conditioner etc. The bed was comfortably firm, and we didn’t hear much from the street because we were high up. The room was small but didn’t feel cramped. We got a city view room which is higher up, so we could see the downtown skyline and part of Times Square. We could see where ABC films Good Morning America from our room which was cool.Overall it was a good place to stay. Proximity to subway stations and Times Square was nice. There are lots of restaurants in the area but if you want to get the real NY dining experience, get out of Mid-town. The hotel restaurant was just ok with service being hot and cold. We dined there for dinner which was great and then breakfast which was not…food and service. The 54th floor bar is pretty amazing with awesome views but consistently poor service. The hotel had just added an 18% gratuity to the bar and restaurant which was annoying since the service wasn’t worth it. The elevators are slooooooow. We waited upwards of 10 mins on one occasion so plan for that. The staff were very friendly and helpful and security was tight to get up to rooms which I appreciated.If you want to stay close to Times Square, definitely check out the Hyatt. Get a higher room away from the elevator if you want quiet.","Kirkland, Washington",58,4.0

The location is excellent and is in great walking distance to most places like Times Square but as it was on a side road, just off, meant that some of the nosiness was reduced and a lot quieter. We originally had a room in 5th floor and must admit that the view was not great and were overlooking another hotel building. However, we spoke to reception and this got changed on our second night and eventually stayed on the 15th.WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ASKING FOR A HIGHER ROOM LEVEL TO GET THE BEST VIEWS!!The some of the kind of security people were very lovely, and would like to shoutout to the young man who works there who wears a black suit- he mainly works during the day, (we couldn’t catch his name). Very polite and welcoming! However, did feel kind of uneasy at times when the security near the elevator would ask to see your room key. I know this is simply precautions and safety but would of thought after 5 nights of going in and out of the hotel, they would of been able to recognise a family of 4?!

They just purchase food from somewhere and take it to your room in paper bags with plastic knives, fork and spoons.... forget about the nice little table with everything nicely served. 2) The restaurant downstairs is the palace for anything BUT healthy food. And the service from one of the bar waitress was just non existent. 3) Overly expensive cocktails in the roof bar. I mean $28 for a hot bourbon cider? Wow!!

The Hyatt Centric is a half-block from this madness in a 54-story building with a small footprint. The half-block distance cut down on the craziness to a considerable degree, but kept you close to this unique location. The small footprint meant that there were only a few rooms per floor (guessing 10-11) - so not much through traffic or noise from other guests. The 54-story allowed for good views if you chose the upper floor option. There are a number of elevators dedicated to the upper floors, and the running times were very reasonable. The lobby of the hotel is very nice, but is neither grand nor elegant. The front desk is efficient and courteous, but doesn't exude great warmth. Our room was appropriately sized. The furnishings were modern, up-to-date and well maintained. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. The bathroom was clean, nicely tiled, and attractive. We had a large shower (not a tub/shower combo) with great water pressure. One wall of our room was floor-to-ceiling side-to-side window - giving great views. But this also let in some of the city noise (e.g., sirens, honking) - which was greatly reduced by being off Times Square. The large window made temperature control a little tricky (when the curtain was open), so you needed to play with the digital thermostat to get comfortable. Our room was basically for sleeping, bathing and interim breaks throughout the day as we toured the city. The location was great, the chaos toned down, and the room peaceful with few disturbances from either inside or outside the hotel. (A temporary negative was a nearby construction site generated considerable noise starting promptly at 7am as they were jack hammering the foundation to a new building - for us, it served as an alarm clock.)",,38,4.0

I was pleased and surprised with the quality of the property and location, but the service and ""heart"" of the experience were disappointing. GOOD:I stayed in a basic king room--I asked for a quiet one, was put on the 44th floor (4405)--it was quiet, away from the elevators (which are not loud--and they're FAST) and high enough that it was indeed quiet.The room's design is sleek and modern, but not too stiff/cold. It's comfortable. The bed is comfortable, linens are crisp looking, yet soft. The shower/bathroom is great (except a colleague staying a few floors down had cold water each morning and had to call to have something done (a fire lit??) that's unacceptable...more than one day in a row). Some towels are new and fluffy, some are tired and flat. The bath products are nice, though not always refreshed each day (?). Robes are not automatically provided in the room, which is odd. Wifi was free and fast. The HVAC was super responsive, quickly cooled/heated the room on demand, without loud sounds/breezy drafts. NOT GOOD:The carpet in my room needs to be steamed with stain removal... it's not been kept up. Cleaned, but never deep cleaned?The front desk staff, at check-in, had to be summoned to serve me--they were at the desk, but I had to ask them if they'd be willing to check me in (they were talking to each other, and generally inattentive).The ""guest services"" receptionists (by phone) were unaware of general answers to questions I posed (the time for breakfast, what breakfast services were available, the availability of room service, etc.) And, on the subject of room service--NO ROOM SERVICE IS AVAILABLE between 11p-6a. Each day, I was out by 6a for work, and had to find breakfast elsewhere--this caused me to leave the hotel to find a new hotel that could provide such service.Some large groups arrived for check in--it would seem plausible to have someone from the hotel take that group away from the front desk (which is very small and difficult to get service from b/c of its small set up) so other guests could be served. It would be great to have a greeter or someone managing the small lobby area to ensure people are in line for the right service, ushered to where they are needed, etc.I was contacted by email, several days in advance of arrival, and asked if I had any particular requests or needs. I wrote back to that email the day before my arrival (maybe the day of arrival) and said I was excited for the stay--needed a quiet room and might want to extend my stay beyond the existing reservation. The email was returned more than a day after check in, I was told nothing was available--it was a short, curt email. I'm tired of properties that send emails asking how they can help and then never being helpful...it's common, but it added to my disappointment at the Centric TSquare. The VIP Experience emailer did write and apologize--offering free breakfast...but as mentioned, breakfast is not available when I need it...so I can't stay at this property.A couple other minor issues: Elevators do not emit any sound when they arrive at the floor where I've requested...and they are hard to see at one time--so I miss them. They need to ""ding."" The gym was dirty--the floor looked as if it had not been vacuumed in weeks. The restroom in the gym did not have any lighting--so I used my phone's flashlight to see...the light was broken. (The gym's equipment was pretty good/updated)","Minneapolis, Minnesota",15,3.0

Curtains not opened, coffee pods not refilled etc. We were very confused as stay at Hyatt's around the world regularly. My husband went on line and googled and realised we were being 'punished' for not tipping everyday. I feel it should have been written up somewhere as we genuinely did not know. Tipping is so hard to work out when you come from a country that doesn't expect tips. I would prefer it was built into the cost of the room and distributed evenly amongst the staff. Then if we find a particular staff member goes above and beyond leave a bonus. We will know for the future and I gather it is because the staff may change daily. I just found it very petty.

I noted this on my reservation, spoke with 2 managers, know their names even, but will not list them to protect them from getting a bad rap. But along with those two, I told the lady at check-in at my 11pm check-in and even called the following morning after finally being able to get a few hours of sleep after the dreadful, torturous storm leaving me with no power and no heat for a total of 1 whole week. In the morning I called to verify the time given and they indicated no records. Talk about communication, or lack thereof. The hotel, very clean, very well kept. But for the outrageous prices and taxes and fees? Save that money to go elsewhere is what I'd recommend. It is not worth the headaches especially knowing I was going to get charged for their mistakes. Other things to note... I requested a king bed, of course that didn't happen. I requested a higher floor room away from noise and away from the elevator. That didn't happen. I asked how they fared on rooms, they were pretty wide open.

Was our first time in NYC and we werent sure what to expect. I read reviews and did alot of research, so was a little nervous about dirty, cramped hotels, rude people and hidden fees on the reservation. We changed our hotel 3 times before deciding on Hyatt Centric. Booked on hotels.com and didnt have to pay until we checked in. We got the Standard room with a view. In the note section on the booking, i mentioned that it was our first time in NYC and we wanted a room up high with a good view. We arrived early, check in was at 3 but we went early, hoping they'd hang on to our luggage until check in, but our room was ready & they let us check in around 1:00. We were on the 32nd floor, one wall was solid windows with an amazing view of Times square. I had read about how noisy the city was at night with sirens, horns and trash trucks & I packed ear plugs that we didnt even need. When the window is open you get a good breeze, and when its closed you cant hear a thing. Blackout curtains kept the room dark from the flashing lights of time square and the morning sun. The hospitality team left us a gift bag with treats, and a coffee mug & keychain with a nice hand written card welcoming us to the city. The room was super clean, plenty of room, comfy bed, fluffy pillows & the duvet was so nice i wanted to bring it home!!! They provided a lighted make up mirror & a really good hair dryer so I didnt have to bring my own. The Cleaning staff was practically invisible. I never saw them, but they slipped in every day while we were out & replenished our towels & toiletries & cleaned up the room very nice for us. There were not robes in the room, but you can request them among other things if you call the front desk. There's a Keurig & a fridge in the room. The bar upstairs was nice, however expensive- (but its NYC what isnt) amazing view from the terrace outside the bar. The hotel is literally IN Time square, took us about 2 minutes to walk there. If you want to take Uber, it takes them about 2 minutes to be right at the front door. When you come in after a long day the doormen do ask to see your keycard to prove you are staying there, but that was added security that we appreciated. I would DEFINITELY recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city. You might pay a tiny bit more than some others, but its TOTALLY worth it to know you have an awesome place to call home while you are visiting. Zero complaints. We had an amazing trip & will definitely stay here again! advice for first timers, if you arrive at LaGuardia, take a cab & its between $30 & $50 depending on traffic. Uber was $35 back to the airport on sunday. DO take the subway, just download app & its easy to navigate anywhere you need to go. There are at least 2 stations within close proximity of the hotel. Walgreens in Time square has everything you need, drinks, beer, or snacks for the mini fridge (cheap) & only a 5 min walk.","burleson, United States",5,5.0

We usually stay at the Park Hyatt or Grand Hyatt; or Le Merdian. Central location, easy access around town. Loved this location. This is the perfect location for tourists and business. It’s on 45th street between 6th and 7th Ave (right in the middle o the block). It’s 1 block from Times Square but still super quiet. Entrance on 45th is a quiet street. I like this location better compared to the W Times Square, which is too close to pedestrian action, making it hard to get in and out of the hotel. Here, you can easily pick up taxis on 6th Ave to head uptown, or on 7th Ave to head downtown. For business, it’s a short walk from mid-town (Park and Madison). We had theatre tickets and hotel is literally 2 blocks away, which was really nice. All the shops in Times Square are open until midnight, which is so awesome. Lobby/Common Area: The lobby is relatively small, but has a nook sitting area. But I will say that service here is a bit uneven. When we arrived at 9pm, there was no bellman outside, so we grabbed one of the luggage carts and loaded our luggage on it. The front desk was full of people and we couldn’t get anyone’s attention to open the automatic doors for us (it was roped off and only the revolving doors were open). Finally, a cleaning staff who was emptying the trash can came to help us with the luggage. Standard Room: We booked a standard room, which only has a shower (Deluxe Room has a tub). The room was typically NYC room, a bit on the small side, but comfortable for 2 people. A large king size bed and soft linens. But the pillows were the flattest pillows I’ve ever slept on, very strange. The room has a club chair and ottoman. The bathroom is surprisingly large, with lots of counter space and a surprise, heated floors, which was so nice! The room however did not have robes or slippers. The bath amenities was a pleasant mango scent. Standard bath amenities plus shaving cream, mouth wash, and deodorant. Nice! Suite: We enjoy taking baths, so we inquired about switching rooms and used our suite upgrades. Note: Apparently, some suites do not have bath tubs. We’re Hyatt Globalist and hotel manager reached out to check on our stay, he was able to accommodate a suite upgrade for part of our stay. The suite is modern and has a spacious bedroom, but living room is oddly laid out with a curvy desk that takes up a lot of space in an awkward angle. The bathroom has a huge bathtub in an enclosure sauna like space with separate shower. This was such an indulgence and my favorite part of this room. The sink area is smaller than the standard room as a result, but that’s ok. The bathroom floors for the suite however are not heated. But there are robes and slippers. Other room amenities: bottled water, coffee and tea. TIP: Hotel has humidifier, which is nice since it’s so dry. The hotel also has umbrellas to loan, it was pouring rain for one day and glad to have them. Note: $35 each if you lose them.Food: As Globalist, we get free breakfast for 2, either at the restaurant downstairs or room service. Love this amenity! The food is quite good. We actually had lunch and dinner at the restaurant T45 a couple of time and enjoyed the bistro style food. We highly recommend dining here.Security: There was always security staff in the lobby in the evenings and they ask to see your key before letting you go to the elevators. However, no key card access is needed to access your floor. Had a very enjoyable stay and we would absolutely stay here again on our next NYC trip. ","Los Angeles, California",416,5.0

I'm always a little wary of staying that close because of the noise and crowds...but if you're looking for ""action,"" you can't get much closer. LOTS to do/see - with plenty of restaurants and shows - within a short walking distance. And we had no problems with noise/crowds for our stay.Check-in: Quick and easy.Room: Our suite was fantastic! Yes - it was relatively small for a suite...but that's NYC. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the sitting room was very nice, and the bathroom was great: the tub with separate overhead shower (next to it) not only looked great, but made for great baths/showers.And the view... Wow! I've stayed in a lot of hotels in NYC, but this view was one of the best I've seen. Just breathtaking.Our initial concern about being next to the elevator was unfounded. Maybe no one else was on the floor? If they were, we couldn't tell - it was completely quiet!Another bonus: The hotel has a wonderful spa! We treated ourselves to massages, which were fantastic. The spa was clean and comfortable, with nice amenities, and the staff was warm, friendly, and helpful.Check-out: Quick and easy. There was a long line (it was 11am - check-out time), but they had 3 people at the desk and another person was working the line with a tablet, so everyone was taken care of quickly.

This place was great from the time we checked in until the time we left and then checked in again and then left again......I'll make sense of that soon.We arrived Dec 30 for a stay until Jan 4th. NY on NYE wasn't the reason for coming it just fell perfectly within our travel itinerary. We chose this particular hotel as it was central to everything. We arrived to the New York chill from DC that evening. We were checked in by a very helpful guy who's name escapes me. He was very informative about the details for getting onto 45th and back to our hotel after the NFL game and quick to have us checked in and up to the room. It's always nice when you're nodding your head with satisfaction before you've even hit the room. Tick!Now we've stayed in three different hotels previously in NYC and all have been basically show boxes regardless of the room type we selected. This time was completely different though. We had a Deluxe Room with 2QB which by NY standards was huge! I was very pleasantly surprised that this would be the room the three of us would be in for the next 5 nights. As we had three large suitcases, a couple of carry-ons and our large winter coats, boots and the like every square inch of space mattered. Tick!The beds were comfortable, the pillows weren't but I was getting used to the incredibly over soft downy pillows US hotels proffered to use. The bathroom was likewise huge for NY standards. A massive bench, a bath! and a huge shower, all clean and modern. We booked a high floor room for the obvious views over the city and were on the 50th floor out of 54. Later we were also on the 10th and that was still good. More on that later. Rooms were always cleaned and made up in a timely manner and complimentary water restocked.The Hotel has a small bar/ restaurant next to it. We had a beer and a hot chocolate there but didn't worry about a breakfast or dinner, there's just so many places around that area you could stay for a year and still not eat in them all. While we were there New York endured what we were told was a 'bomb cyclone' or something like that in which the temperatures one day dropped to 3F (-16C) with wind chill to -22F (-30C). It was insane! The average was around 14F (-10C) every day. Upon checking out we drove to the airport through the ever growing layer of snow. I wanted to see snow (we're from Australia, no snow where we we are ever) but this was crazy. Flights in all three NY airports were grounded and rebooking flights at the earliest was in three days time. Back to the Hyatt Centric where we re-checked, this time in a Standard 2QB room as the Deluxe were no longer available.So onto the standard room. Well this was definitely a let down from the Deluxe but you expect that. Much smaller room footprint, way smaller bathroom and just little things that make all the difference when you get to compare. Smaller rain shower head, no pull out vanity mirror on the wall, tiny bedside clock instead of large full function, just little things. Still nice, clean and modern, just not deluxe. This was a 10th floor room and we still had a nice city (I should say buildings) view and in future I can't see any real reason to pay extra to go up 40 floors. A few other things to note was security to get to the elevators everyday and checking room keys after 4pm. This happened all the way up until NYE and onward after so I gather it's an ongoing thing. Hot apple cider for anyone in the foyer. You have to try it, it's like hot liquid apple pie and when it's snowing outside it's a warm welcome back to the hotel.Like I thought before I started typing, this place is hard to fault. We had a ball in NY as always and would highly recommend the Hyatt Centric Times Square. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Thanks guys!","Adelaide, Australia",49,5.0

Great location and they should work to upsell...starting with a smiling hostess.Rooftop bar - (SCORE: 2) - absolute nice location; however, every location my friend wanted to sit she was told it wasn't available. If reserve seating is there or if only certain seats can be used by the number of people in the party - it should be clearly stated as such not only as you enter the bar but in the room as well. As for the greeting - absolute worst.

So in location alone I would recommend the Hyatt Centric.Overall I can not fault the hotel and catering for our needs whilst in NYC, I was just sad to leave and come home.So thank you for an amazing time.","Southfleet, United Kingdom",6,5.0

On our last visit to NYC, we stayed at a hotel closer to Herald Square that was on a side street and we had a difficult time getting a taxi. Hailing a taxi at the Hyatt Centric was never an issue. When I made the reservation, I had requested a room on a high floor away from the street because other reviewers stated that the rooms can be noisy especially when trying to sleep at night. Unfortunately, we were given a room on a lower floor fronting 45th Street and it was noisy. We asked if we could be moved to a different room. The front desk graciously accommodated our request and the next morning we were moved to a much quieter location. Both rooms were very clean and modern. The staff was great. The hotel manager went above and beyond checking to make sure we were comfortable and leaving treats for us after we were moved to a different room. We felt very safe in the hotel and the surrounding area. There are many good dining options for all budgets near the hotel. I had thought about staying at other less expensive hotels in mid-town/Times Square, but many of those reviewers stated that they had to wait a long time for the elevator.

We was supposed to arrive on the 18th Dec but due to issues with the airline we only arrived on the 19th December. I had reserved a King room with a View and had informed them why we was travelling there. We waited to see if we would receive an email from the hotel before we arrived to see if we had any requests however they did not get in touch so my boyfriend emailed the hotel a week before our arrival the arrange something special on my Birthday. I kept the hotel informed of when we would be arriving so that they did not give my room away. When we finally arrived the lady at the front desk tried to charge me $3000 for a room on the 20th floor. I thought i was being scammed. The room she was giving me didn't even have a view yet was trying to charge me something so ridiculous. Of course, i quickly informed her i had booked a room with a view. She spoke to her manager and just like that they found my room and suddenly the price dropped down to something more reasonable. They keep $50 each night in case you use any hotel facilities during your stay. They also only add the taxes on to your hotel price when you arrive, definitely something to bare in mind when making your hotel booking. We got to our room and there was no wine, no nothing, no birthday message or anything. Other than this the room was nice and the bathroom was modern. We had a really nice view, and could even see the One World Trade Center. We went up to the rooftop bar once, the views were really nice but the prices are way too extreme. Location of the hotel was brilliant. We walked everywhere. We even walked from our hotel down to Brooklyn Bridge. I cant wait to return to New York however my next visit will not be spent in the Hyatt Centric.","Preston, United Kingdom",13,3.0

We were arriving in NYC late morning and I took advantage of early check in online and noted our arrival time 1:30 pm. I got an email at 10:45 am that our room was already ready. We were able to go straight to out room and not park our luggage at thr front desk. The hotel is only 4 years old and looks great. Very clean and well maintained. We did a lot of research on the hotels in the Times Square area and this one had the most consistent and good ratings. Our room was impeccable and was a nice size. The bathroom was a decent size and even had radiant heat floors. Extra points for that ! The lighting in the bathroom was not bright enough for putting on makeup. The only problem was the wi-fi went down the second day of our stay and they had a contractor there the following day and had not been able to correct it when we checked out. They have a rooftop bar with a beautiful view of Manhattan but the drinks were quite expensive. The staff was friendly and courteous. The bed was a little firm for me but I got used to it. The Keurig was full sized and the hairdryer was a very nice model that was powerful and quiet. These touches made a difference in our stay. We did not eat a meal there because of other activities but we did have the vegan chili one night and it was excellent. The cocktails are good. Our bartender made a very tart Cosmo and we were not able to correct the taste despite adding additional sugar water. The other drinks we ordered were fine. We were very pleased with the hotel.

I knew from reading other reviews that this was close to Time Square, but rest assured that the “30 second walk” is no exaggeration. The bright lights of Time Square really are on your doorstep. Upon arriving at the hotel it was late in the evening but I was thoroughly impressed by the warm welcome we received. Having explained that it was our first time in NYC the man on reception was only too happy to give us a map, restaurant recommendations, subway tips and just some generally useful information to help us make the best of our time - it really was appreciated. After a relatively swift check-in we were off to our rooms. We could see a little bit of Time Square from our window (see picture - don’t look down!) and I was impressed at how well the room was blacked out. I’m a light sleeper and didn’t worry that the lights would keep me awake - I need not have worried. This hotel is in the heart of Time Square and midtown which means that not only is it well connected to public transport, but lots of things are within relatively easy walking distance.We hardly spent any time at the hotel, it was just somewhere to get a good nights sleep and a shower and so with respect to that, I can’t fault it.

There are pictures of food on the website, but when I asked the front desk for information on food that just told me there was no restaurant/food service in the building.

I went downstairs to complete my financial obligation and they were swapped, and of course I understood.

This was my second stay at a Centric branded hotel. It is a smaller, boutique style hotel. The design and decor is modern. The lobby and check-in are rather small in terms of space. There is a restaurant to the left of the lobby with the elevators on the right. We received an upgrade to a King Deluxe suite on the 51st floor which consisted of two separate rooms, a living space with a sleeper sofa, and a bedroom with a king bed, along with a bathroom which included separate shower and tub. The bathroom has heated floors which is awesome. It would be nice for U.S. Hyatt hotels to add a bidet feature to the bathroom. Even if you cannot install the full fledged fancy seat bidet, it would be great to have the small handheld feature for cleansing.The room had beautiful views of Times Square and really the location is pretty cool. You can walk a few feet and be right in the middle of the action, steps away from Broadway, shopping, and the subway.There is a restaurant onsite (first floor) and we ate breakfast there a few days, with breakfast delivered to the room one day (another Globalist benefit as this hotel does not have a lounge so breakfast is included).. There were plenty of breakfast items to choose from and the food was pretty good. There is a rooftop bar with beautiful city views. Parking is usually $60 per night for valet, and $45 for self park. Customer service was really great as the agent who checked us in accompanied us to the room to make sure we had everything we needed. Paola was also so friendly and kind and really made a difference in how we enjoyed our stay!","atlanta, United States",21,4.0

I was very impressed by this resort and have been ranting and raving every since. Last Saturday (the 16th) my boyfriend and I took a trip into the city to celebrate his birthday, see a Broadway show and the tree at Rockefeller Center. After leaving the show we decided to grab a couple of drinks and stumbled by the Hyatt Centric Time Square. We kind of laughed and said ""Look, its a Hyatt. Now we have to check it out!."" not thinking that the service would be as phenomenal at it was in Mexico. Boy, were we wrong! We walked into T45 (the bar/restaurant) and were greeted by a super sweet and friendly hostess named Liz. She sat us a table at the bar and recommended the ""Cherry Velvet"" cocktail. I loved it! While enjoying our drinks we overheard Liz telling patrons that the hotel had a rooftop longue, B54, but they had a waitlist that was about 3 hours long. The bartenders and manager were very attentive which is impressive for a Saturday Evening in NYC. We left to walk around the city and about an hour later decided to go back for dinner. When we went back in and asked Liz if any tables were available for dinner she said that she could get us one then handed us an access card to have ""a couple of drinks on the rooftop before dinner"". Yes, the same rooftop that had a 3 hour wait just an hour prior. We couldn't believe it. The views on the rooftop were spectacular. It wasn't overly crowded with small, intimate tables placed perfectly. You had a gorgeous view wherever you sat. The drinks were delicious and not ridiculously expensive for this beautiful lounge. It was perfect. We went back downstairs and, of course, Liz had our table waiting for us. Again, this kind of treatment is almost unheard of for NYC during the Holiday Season. Our waiter was Asif. He was very attentive and he had the best food recommendations. Everything was delicious. We ordered Cheesecake for dessert. When he brought it to our table he placed another dessert next it and said ""I know you wanted cheesecake but our Pecan Pie is outstanding. Enjoy this from us. Its on the house"". BTW Two of the best desserts I've ever had. Needless to say, service from top to bottom (no pun intended) was nothing less than excellent. Once again the Hyatt gave us an amazing experience and made us feel like royalty. No, we didn't see the rooms but based on everything else I wouldn't imagine anything less than perfect.

Rooms are clean, well laid out, and are pretty good size for New York City. I particularly was pleased with the room having a decent sized desk, a good sized bathroom, and an actual closet instead of a standalone unit, which is quite common for NYC hotel rooms.2.) Check in was a breeze. After a long day of travel, they got us in quickly.3.) Elevators are fast. I've often encountered slow elevators, and with our room being on the 45th floor, we were especially glad that we didn't have to spend lots of time waiting for the elevator to arrive each time we wanted to leave.4.) Internet was fast. This is such a big deal for so many business travelers, and I was glad to see that this hotel took internet speed seriously.5.) Location is fantastic. We did quite a bit of sightseeing including seeing Aladdin on Broadway, and this was a great central place to be.Cons:1.) Hyatt Platinum status was not recognized, and consequently, no room upgrade. This isn't a huge deal, but it's always nice to be upgraded when possible.2.) Traffic is so incredibly bad in this area that the Uber drivers often dropped our rides rather than coming to us. I'd recommend learning how to navigate public transportation or walking a ways to get an Uber or Lyft as this was incredibly frustrating. This doesn't necessarily reflect on the hotel, but definitely something to think about when staying in this location.Conclusion: We will definitely be back! Thanks for a great visit for my wife and I and our babymoon.","Elkhart, Indiana",45,5.0

Trying not to be too negative, but some large disappointments soured an otherwise fantastic time in NYC.We (a party of 5), booked three rooms for a special occasion. We arrived 15 minutes after check in, and were told only two rooms were available as the third was still being cleaned...fair enough. It actually took three hours for that room to be ready, we chased it four times with reception staff that were frankly rude and disinterested, we were not given any sort of apology. The explanation was that this room was taking longer than expected to clean, but the room itself turned out to be immediately next door to one of our other two rooms and there was NO cleaning activity or members of staff coming or going at all so their reasoning sounds slightly iffy to me. I understand issues happen, but the attitude of the staff was very poor. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and never before have I been subject to such a poor and annoying check-in.I have mentioned that our stay was for a special occasion, over a month before we ordered and paid for a birthday cake to be in the room on arrival. When we arrived, no cake in sight. This was chased again with reception, and another less than pleasant staff member instructed the kitchen to deliver this as soon as possible. An hour later, the cake was delivered to one of our rooms but needless to say the surprise was ruined. Again, no apology (I must say the cake was very good!). Reception staff did keep referring to me as different names too, maybe some more confusion in regards to who we actually were?The rooms themselves were very nice, with good views over Times Square! They were also very clean, oh and heated floors in the bathroom! Hairdryer, coffee, safe etc all included, basically everything you need for a stay.Bar 54 is also worth a visit, but again a less than favourable impression with staff. One waitress was extremely abrupt when one of our party asked for clarification regarding serving drinks on the balcony (I quote “I have already told you once, I don’t need to clarify”) a shocking tone to a customer paying top dollar for drinks and service. There was also a problem with payment, upon checkout we were told that we had underpaid! We completely dispute this fact, but had no choice but to pay the alleged difference when we left.This was my fourth stay in NY in less than six years. By contrast, two years ago we stayed at Citizen M a block over for an anniversary. On mentioning this upon arrival, the next day we had a hand written congratulations card plus voucher for two free drinks in the room. Also (completely coincidentally), our room wasn’t ready on arrival! We were also given two free drinks in the way of apology. I appreciate issues happen, it’s the way they are resolved that count. The customer facing staff we encountered at Hyatt were very largely disappointing at best, especially considering this place has such a positive reputation.I love NYC, but will not stay here again. P.s the cleaning staff and the door staff (Walter especially) were brilliant! The reception staff should take note of this, and of the Hyatt’s competition.","Tamworth, United Kingdom",44,3.0

Large for NYC standards, it contained a king bed, desk, a cabinet that housed a safe and refrigerator and a nice, large flat screen TV. The bathroom contained both a shower and a tub and again was large by NYC standards. Everyone we came in contact with was warm, friendly and accommodating. The location can't be beat -- close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall and Bryant Park. Within comfortable walking distance of Herald Square and Central Park.

So, to start ---- I got a ""Welcome back to the Hyatt Centric TS!"" when I checked-in.-- my bathroom had a heated floor this time 'round. Quite a treat during cold mornings-- on one night, the tank of my toilet was not filling properly and I called house keeping for help. An engineer was down within 10 minutes of my call and got the problem fixed promptly. He was also quite courteous. -- the ""art work"" over the table was a stylized map of New York State and surrounds consisting of descriptions (in words) of the 5 boroughs and NJ. The descriptions were quite interesting to read through and a nice way to add a NYC vibe to the room.-- the view of TS is partial and from an angle. It isn't, quite truthfully, all that great. I'm not quite sure paying a premium for a TS ""view"" is worth it in this case.  -- the toiletries are from the Marilyn Monroe spa. They were okay but the stuff from Le Labo you'll get at a Park Hyatt or from Molton Brown at a certain other hotel are definitely much better.-- I think the ground floor restaurant's undergone a name change and, maybe, a menu change as well. i can't really say since, unlike my first stay, I didn't sample its wares this time around.

It was sufficient. The pro's were vast: hotel location, room was quiet on the 14th floor, great service, great housekeeping, helpful concierge, the restaurant, and the hot apple cider to warm us as we left for the cold outdoors.

Very good lighting, nice hairdryer, overall very comfortable.I admit that at first I was a bit doubtful due to the size of the reception area, very small, not enough seating space. Had to wait for a bit for my room to become available and they were sopose to send a message when it became available and didn’t, no email nor sms, anyway since we didn’t go anywhere I went to see if there were any news regarding the room and it was already available, they apologise for the lack of communication and all was well.Fantastic LOCATION, just around the corner from the Disney Store, as if we didn’t had enough of that, but you can never have enough of Disney so it was handy, very nice places to eat in the heart of Times Square.If you stay at the Centric do not miss out on the Rooftop bar, its an amazing view, we were lucky with the weather, but even if it’s a bit cold it’s worth the view. Loved It.The bar / restaurant on the ground floor is also very nice, we had lunch just before leaving to the airport, already too tiered to walk around anymore, and it was very nice, the food was very good and can’t complain.It was a very nice couple of days and definitely will be back.Recommend the room with the view, it’s always nice the New York View.",Lisbon,35,5.0

Having said that, the hotel is a miss. We checked in on a busy Saturday afternoon at 1pm. Our room was not ready which i understood. The front desk said they would call us when it was ready. Yup, never received that call and only when we checked back with the hotel did they let us know that the room was ready. We were really jet lagged and would have loved a nap but it was not to be. I am a World of Hyatt explorist member. Generally, that means I am offered a choice of amenity or points on check in. I never received that even though I confirmed that they had my Hyatt number. Also, it means that I would ordinarily not get the smallest room, overlooking the alley on a low floor. I guess they figured that we wanted into a room so badly that they could get away with giving us that room. The net of it is that the hotel is convenient but a glorified Hyatt place.

We had drinks at the rooftop bar one evening and it was really nice. A little pricey, but you are paying for the view. We had breakfast in the restaurant every morning and it was really good.

I hold a Hyatt gold passport. The first time I checked in the person at the front office said he had no room of my category available at that point of time and downgraded me without informing me. He said he was giving me a different category room. I asked him what that meant and was I losing any benefits and he said no. I also said I was in no hurry and I could leave my baggage and come back later to check in which he ignored. As a result our room wasn't as nice and there was no complimentary breakfast. There was also no extended checkout. The second time I went to the hotel I saw the difference with the lady at front office welcoming me, giving me a higher category room , complimentary breakfast and extended checkout. I asked her why I was not extended the same privilages during my last stay and she was flummoxed. The amazing thing was I got a feedback email only for my second stay and not the first.

Noisy but not unexpectedly so considering where the hotel is located. Reasonable sized room, furniture all a bit mismatched and top drawer of chest broken. However, the room was clean and the bed comfortable but nothing really out of the ordinary. Arrived in the afternoon having flown in from London with a 4am start so just wanted to order room service and catch an early night. Had to call housekeeping twice over a two-hour period to ask for a room directory/compendium of their services so I could see what their room service offering was. Gluten-free diets clearly not catered for, and no real interest in providing anything appetising. Ended up with a dry burger between two slice of GF bread and some plain salad leaves. All delivered in a cardboard box with plastic cutlery. Hyatt claim this is an environmentally sustainable solution but it felt bargain basement and decidedly down market. Didn't eat anything else in the hotel over the next four days. Called also for a bathrobe (they'll supply if requested) when it came it was very old and had a hole mid-way down the front (also a fairly largish slit in my duvet cover). Incredibly grumpy man on reception when I checked out (was reluctant to print my bill until after I had handed over my card!). Zero customer service skills and no social niceties.

Sheets, towels, bathroom are perfectly clean.King size bed was really comfortable and great.We got complimentary mineral water bottles everyday which was really nice.As for the staff, ill start with a small case- We ran into one of the maids when we left the room. We asked for a shower cap. The lady said ""ok"". When we got back, 3 shower caps were waiting for us.Seemingly- a simple thing but this maid was not near our room, she could have easily forgotten about it but no- she made it happen. This is one of these little things that matter. Show that the staff cares.Last but not least, as our flight was at 6pm, we wanted to leave the room at 2pm.Checkout time is 11am where it could be extended (per availability), until 12:00pm.We asked if its possible to extend and gave the reason.Alex the manager agreed to let us keep the room until 2pm.And again- these are the things which makes the difference between a nice visit to the city to an overall great travel experience.I think the staff at Hyatt Centric found the magic formula here and given the hotel's amazing condition and location, they can only win it from here.This is my preferred hotel for NYC.

They not only provided us with a small meeting room at a great price but also exceptional service when booking the sleeping rooms for our small group as well.The location of the hotel was perfect for us to explore NYC for our first visit. Half a block from Times Square (closest subway station too) close to many restaurants and bars and about an hours cab ride in from JFK.Lobby area is on the smallish side, but they do offer a restaurant/bar right along side the area. We had drinks here on a couple occasions during our stay, but I must say, I am not a big fan of their 'gender neutral' washrooms. Front desk staff where friendly, and the bellmen where great as well. They suggested hiring one of their large SUV's for a day tour around Manhattan, rather than taking the double decker tourist busses on a Saturday -- EXCELLENT idea for our group of 8. Before you get to the elevators, you must present your room key to security, which was appreciated as well.I was a bit disappointed in the location of our hotel room. We where on the 23rd floor, and everyone else in our group was placed on floor 38 or higher, and all our room reservations indicated we would be on a higher floor. Due to the lower floor, we could hear traffic and siren noise all night - but that is to be expected due to the location as well.Room was on the smallish side, but that is NYC. Bed was comfortable, TV large and we appreciated the fridge in the room - something you don't always see in hotels now. Bathroom was very modern with shower only, great hair dryer and the in room safe was handy as well. We went to the rooftop bar on 2 occasions during our stay. First night and our last night. Both times the service was less than ideal. Hostesses not the most friendly, but once they realized we where hotel guests, suddenly a large 'reserved' table opened up for our group, after telling us 5 minutes before they where fully booked. Last night there, the bartender didn't want to serve us when we showed up a half hour BEFORE closing - he lost out on a large tip. The views are amazing, but service could use some tweaking for sure.Overall I definitely recommend this hotel based on the location and overall service.This was our first trip to NYC, and I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did, so will be back, and look at staying here again.",Alberta,165,5.0

The only negative comment is the rooms are getting a little worn even though the hotel is relatively new. Carpets are fraying and have stains, doors and baseboards are nicked up, and towels are well worn and flimsy. I suspect its because there is a lot of tourist traffic at this hotel.

We used a Hyatt Diamond Suite Upgrade certificate. We were assigned a lovely 2-room suite about halfway up the hotel. Room was great, though there were some technical glitches where even the maintenance staff couldn't get the lights in the room to shut off! So that was a bit odd, but we still give it 5 stars because of the wonderful location for us-- we attended three Broadway shows in three days, and our exact same plan was: go to the Hyatt's rooftop bar for a glass of champagne, then walk to the theater (all within about 10 minutes leisurely walk or less), enjoy a show. Loved it. Breakfast for Diamonds is a credit of $xx which was plenty for the two of us. Really lovely food, with both healthy and/or decadent options. Friendly service too. Front desk and lobby was not 5*, which is OK with us-- it's almost always full of people and busy-- so it's not a place to hang out; that's ok since the restaurant is a separate room and there is always the rooftop for a great place to have a drink and chill out. The prices can be crazy on some weekends, but we found rates that were quite reasonable, and loved our experience.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",170,5.0

We have stayed other places in previous years, but after this experience, plan to always come back and stay HERE. Whether you're coming to visit with a group, or alone, here are some of the highlights & perks we loved about this excellent hotel:1. The SIZE! Wow, right off the bat every person who walked in the room said ""This is massive, especially for New York!"" At over 300 square feet, there was more than enough space in our two-queen-bed room for four women, all our suitcases, extra furniture like chairs and footstools, etc., and rushing around each other to get ready in the morning. There was also a huge double-door closet for all our dresses and shoes.2. The bathroom! Full sized soaking tub, separate huge shower, and a sink & counter area with room-wide mirror made getting gussied up a breeze. All four of us were able to do hair & makeup at the same time, with plenty of elbow room! 3. Location! We were literally a half-block from the heart of Times Square, which meant all the shopping, dining, transportation, and sightseeing we wanted to do was just a 1-minute walk away. This was hands-down the most convenient hotel I've ever stayed at in NYC! From the 41st floor we were able to hear some street noise, but it never kept us from sleep. Only once were we bothered by excessive noise, and it was by a bagpipe parade happening right in front of the hotel, so we just went downstairs and joined in!4. Views! I'm from Boise, Idaho, where our tallest building is only 18 stories, so I looooove rooms with beautiful views and rooftop bars. This Hyatt Centric has both of these things! Our room overlooked beautiful high-rise scenery, and the rooftop Bar 54 was simply the most gorgeous place to hang out in NYC. <3 5. The service! From the moment we arrived, this hotel's staff bent over backwards to make our stay wonderful, from fresh flowers in the room to bringing non-down pillows late at night for our allergy sufferer to sleep peacefully on. None of our crew had any complaints about hotel staff; every person we encountered was kind and professional, and always happy to fulfill any need we requested. They made us feel like family!6. Condition! Some hotels in New York are old. Some have been renovated, but you can still feel their past. The Hyatt Centric Times Square felt fresh and new, in every aspect, from pristine rooms to the hotel's high-tech look. We saw no mold, dirt, or wear & tear throughout our stay.Cons: Only two! I would recommend fans in the bathrooms, to help with shower steam. Also, some breakfast options would be much appreciated, even if it was just a granola bar and juice. We would have happily paid for room service breakfast options. XOXO Hyatt Centric Times Square & all your crew! We loved our time with you, and will be back again soon! <3","Boise, Idaho",4,5.0

We shared a two-queen bed room, and were blown away by the room size! Having visited NYC before, we were expecting tight quarters, but at over 300 sq ft our room felt massive. We LOVED the huge bathroom as well, with shower, soaking tub, and a room-long horizontal mirror for hair & makeup! There was so much space in there, we never had to fight over bathroom/getting ready time! The staff at this hotel was also top-notch, with every person we encountered going above & beyond to make our stay amazing. Alexander, Abigail, Ben: you're fabulous! Thank you for your care & attention! Two quick things to note, that might be a concern for some: This hotel is a half-block from the center of Times Square, so no matter what floor you are on there is bound to be some street noise. It's not terrible by any means, and never once interrupted our sleep (Except for a bagpipe parade one Saturday morning! But we just got up and went down to enjoy it.) So sound might be a small issue for some very light sleepers. However, the advantage of being so close to Times Square means E V E R Y T H I N G is at your fingertips; food, drinks, shopping, entertainment, shows, and transportation! Our fashionista group adored this hotel, and we plan to be back again year after year. BEST place to stay in New York City, hands-down.",,0,5.0

This time I brought my two boys with me, one in grade school and the other about to start high school. The six-day trip was important to me since it would be the first introduction for my kids to one of my favourite places in the world.There are many hotel choices in NYC but getting the best in location, room size, service and comfort/cleanliness usually involves a steep price premium. I was a little worried about where my kids and I would end up given the budget I had imposed on myself. I needn't have worried. I travel a great deal for work, usually of the Hilton and Marriott variety, and thought that it would be difficult to be surprised by a hotel choice. The Hyatt Centric surprised me on many levels. As others have noted, the location is exceptional being near Times Square but just distant enough to serve as a respite from the frenetic pace of the city. The rooms are very large by NYC standards. This meant more to me as I got deeper into the stay with two active kids. The decor was modern yet warm while the linens made it hard to get up in the morning. New bottles of water appeared every day and the toiletries had a wonderful mango coconut scent. WiFi speed was top notch and the business centre let me print my boarding passes and Broadway tickets. We had breakfast every morning at T45 and these meals were among the most memorable of our culinary experiences in the city; not an easy feat with the roster of restaurants that they were up against.There were other little things that impressed me; having to show my key card to security before getting on the elevator, the morning family tour of the 54th floor viewing deck of Bar 54 and the staff that were always smiling.However, the big surprise was the welcome e-mail from the Director of Operations, Alexander Dechagas. The e-mail wasn't a surprise since many of us get these automated messages as a standard operating procedure. The surprise was when I responded to the first e-mail and asked whether some preferences could be accommodated. Not only was I generously accommodated but Alexander checked-in with me during and after the stay. It was above and beyond and this alone will assure my return to Hyatt Centric.There are a lot of great places to stay in NYC and I've stayed at many of them, from the Waldorf Astoria to the Marriott Times Square.

So glad I did! The room was lovely. Generously sized, modern bathroom, very clean. Heat/air conditioning worked very well and was quiet. Payed for a high floor so we wouldn't have any street noise. The noise insulation between the rooms must be great, because we heard absolutely nothing from the rooms next-door. The only negative about the room is that the lighting in the bathroom is quite dark. If I were bothering to apply make up, it would be a challenge.The hotel is very tall and narrow. Over 50 floors, with only about 10 rooms on each floor. There is a rooftop bar with an outdoor terrace for adults. For families with kids they offer escorted trips to the roof at 10:30 in the morning each day. I took advantage, since I was traveling with my two teenagers. Nice views and phot op. Staff was very courteous, and check in and check out was quick and easy. Traveling mid week, checking out at about three in the afternoon, I waited about 10 minutes to get my car from the valet.

We wanted to stay in the heart of everything and this hotel definitely ticks that box; in fact we underestimated how busy this hotel would be! Check in took a while due to it being so busy and it was clear the staff were feeling the stress since we didn't even get a smile! Our deluxe view room on the 35th floor was great but I did feel it was overpriced; we've stayed just around the corner for much less in the past; the additional taxes added each night are a real sting in the tail when you get your bill. All this was minor though to the fact we had items taken from our room! The hotel, after initially seeming quite blasé about this, did take us seriously after the second complaint and promised an investigation; hopefully they have found the culprit and held them to account by now. We were pleased that they did their best to replace what was taken yet it hampered our stay immensely; we've travelled lots and have never had this happen before. We will most definitely not be returning to this hotel on our next visit; the stunning rooftop bar, amazing smelling lobby and immaculate surroundings mean nothing if you're worried about the belongings in your room.

You are litteraly 3 to 5mn walk from Times Square and can reach out to all the strategic areas of NYC from there quite easily. We were walking all the way to Central Park from there throught the main avenues and city highlights. It's convenient to visit NYC walking or by subway. If you intend to use Taxis don't stay there, to get in and out it's absolutely horrible (Many Uber drivers canceled the booking on us due to traffic).The reception staff and the doormen were really polite. The restaurant / café inside the hotel premises though is very average, we were surprised by the level of service we were getting by one of the waiters (No smile, lack of responsiveness), and the choice of food and beverages is limited there, so you definitemy need to get out of the Hotel for dining.One annoying thing was the lift system, they were taking long to come (Indeed there many floors) but whith toddlers to manage and strollers and sometimes shopping all together after a long day outside, waiting several minutes to get the lift is not ideal.Ask for a room with a Times Square View, this is to me the main advantage besides its location of this Hotel.","Casablanca, Morocco",35,4.0

No sitting area, no room for suitcases etc. The bathroom was nice and big. Rooftop bar was lovely and the staff in there were very friendly! Check in was not good at all, we arrived after official check in time to be told that our room ""wasn't ready"". I do not understand how this is the case when it was after the check in time that they advertise, we had a river cruise booked for 7.30pm so couldn't wait too long, we told them this and they said it would not be long. 1 hour later we returned to the check in desk to see how much longer to be told again, not ready and wouldn't be much longer, and that they were giving us a ""nicer room"". We were told another room was available and the lady smirked when asked if it was also a ""nicer room""? She said it was a higher floor? So in the end we took that room as we were already late to start getting ready and needed to soon, so we will never know what this apparently ""nicer room"" was. Other than that we had no issues, the doormen were lovely and very helpful, especially getting us a taxi to the airport on our way home.

Food quality was not too bad, but not good either. We tried avoiding eating at the hotel as much as possible. Location was great. Very close to Times Square and we easily walked from hotel to sight see at museums, Empire State, some shopping at fifth avenue and even to grand central station. It's also very close to a subway terminal, which made it convenient. Only bad thing was the noise at late hours of the night from trash pickup trucks, police and/or ambulance sirens from the street. It is New York after all. I've been to other cities, but this is one of he first times normal city street noise actually kept me up. I think maybe the building isn't as sound-proofed as other hotels I've stayed at. We ended up asking to get moved to a higher floor and they were nice enough to accommodate us. All would've been well except the new room they moved us to seemed like the reject room. Broken vanity mirror and the sink was slow draining. I can only assume it's partially clogged. A little disappointing because I offered to pay to get moved to a higher floor. They moved us as a courtesy without extra charges, but it became very obvious right away as of why no extra charge. But on the bright side, it was a lot quieter and we got better sleep. I also had a chance to use the spa. Had a little hiccup at check-in when guy over-charged me right off the bat for my spa services. They like to make guests prepay before their massage. Also massage therapist didn't do it firm enough. If someone doesn't do the massage with firm enough pressure, then it just becomes uncomfortable because it's tickling at times. I wanted to relax and not get tickled.

The hotel cost more than I typically spend and I could see why and it was worth it. However: it was a sweltering August day and I wasn't in the best health. When I arrived I was purple in colour and dripping with sweat (nice. also probably why maid took pity on me). I could not wait to shower and blast the AC, I was dreaming of AC. But the AC unit will not go below 67 F. I'm a warm-blooded person at the best of times. Also, sometimes I need to dress clients in heavy costumes and wigs - 67 would be too warm on a normal spring or summer day. Certainly when humidity is in the 80's a cold shower does nothing to cool you if you get out and start sweating again. I can understand the reasoning behind this but I just do need cooler options, if only for 15 minute blasts. I called reception and their suggestion was to send up a fan. I eagerly accepted but it never arrived. Secondly, the bathroom is beautiful with a rainforest showerhead and perfectly polished shiny floor!! -....!!

I liked everything about the hotel. It's in Times Square near the theater district, it's a 15 minute walk from Penn Station, it's modern, clean, and the staff is friendly and attentive. I signed up for the World of Hyatt membership to take advantage of preferred rates. A day before my arrival I received an email from hotel management welcoming me. The morning of my impending arrival I received an email asking if I wanted to upgrade my room at no extra charge. However I declined the offer, because I was traveling with my daughter and we wanted to sleep in separate queen beds as originally planned. The upgrade offered one king bed and one sofa bed. The front desk staff was friendly and check-in was fast. The only comment about check-in I have was I reserved 2 queen beds, high floor and the front desk agent assigned me to a room on the 22nd floor. I questioned if that was a high floor and she said this is what your reservation is for. I pulled out my confirmation paper to show her I had a high floor , 2 queen beds reserved. She said our assigned room was a corner room with a view and if we went for the high floor it wouldn't have a view. I let my daughter choose and off to the 22nd floor we went to our room with a view. There is a staff member who stands near the elevators whom you show a room key to day and night to access the rooms. There are 2 elevator banks to access high and low floors quickly (the hotel has 54 floors). The room was clean (it smelled fresh like it had been recently cleaned). However, housekeeping should check the chairs to see if they need a vacuum. Someone left coarse salt (like on soft pretzels) in both chairs. The beds are lush so you will sleep well. The bathroom is roomy and has a control to turn on the heated floor. There's a rain shower showerhead and a handheld showerhead. The toiletries in the bathroom were luxurious. There's an iron, ironing board, coffee maker, and small refrigerator in the room. Bottled water and coffee are complimentary. There was no bottled water in the room when we got there, but it was promptly brought when I called guest services. The guest floors do not have a lot of rooms on them. We never heard any disturbing hallway noise or any noise from the next room. It was raining at dinner time, so the hotel has a bin of umbrellas in the lobby you can borrow. For a nightcap, We tried the rooftop bar, B54. In addition to indoor seating, It has outdoor seating (weather permissible) and observation area so you can check out the lofty views of Times Square at night. We ate breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby. The breakfast prices were comparable to any other restaurant in the area and the food was good. The waiter was friendly and attentive. If I need a hotel in the Times Square area again, I would definitely stay here again! I do think I would opt for a high floor though, because I could hear police sirens a couple of times while sleeping. ","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",10,5.0

One of the hotels we booked into and cancelled was the Marriott Springhill Suites with 2 queen beds on 37th St. Why? Even though they included free breakfast, the price per night was about $50 more per night.While breakfast was not included at the Hyatt Centric, the central location and service made up for it. The Hyatt Centric had many nearby options for a breakfast at less than $10 a person. We were able to catch several different subway lines within a couple of blocks of the hotel.

It was two adults (three for one night) and one toddler in a regular room. Finding the hotel was sort of tricky, as there was not very good signage. Had it not been for us meeting someone who had gotten there in advance, I may have easily walked past it. The lobby is basic. Just a front desk when you immediately walk in, and a small business center for booking your broadway tickets, or printing your boarding passes upon departure. There's also a door person to help open doors (Fantastic for when you're carrying baggage, and/or pushing a stroller), and also someone who asks guests to show their room keys before proceeding to the elevator. Also, walls are fairly thin. My crying toddler was easily heard from in the hallway, can't imagine how loud you could hear him in the adjacent rooms! Location is great, just off the main drag of Time's Square and Dickson Plaza, and three blocks away from Bryant Park and Whole Foods. Close to many of NYC's iconic dining options such as Junior's Cafe, or the Starlight Diner. Lyceum Theater is next door. There's also a fantastic, albeit very expensive, grab and go place called Cranberry Cafe two storefronts down. Rooms were fine, just a little small, and nicely appointed. Beds were comfortable. Floor to ceiling windows with blackout curtains. There's a small mini fridge in the dresser, as well as a safe. Complimentary water bottles and coffee were also provided. At one point, we also asked if there was a microwave available in the building to heat up leftover pizza. One was later brought up to our room. We also requested a crib, which came with sheets, a blanket, and a johnson&johnsons travel kit that contained baby shampoo, lotion, head to toe wash, desitin, baby powder, and a case of baby wipes, which was very nice. My only major complaint was the design of the beds. I forgot to take a picture, but the beds rest on a platform to elevate them off the floor. The platform itself has a wooden frame that sticks out at just the perfect height to scrape your shins on that is covered by the comforter, so you don't really see them. Eventually, we just pulled the mattress down to rest on top of the edge of the platform so that we wouldn't continue scraping our shins on it!",,13,4.0

No one, not one single time in 6 days, remembered that we stayed there. The hotel contacted me mid trip to see how my stay was going and I informed them I would be proposing. They said they were going to help make it a night my fiancé and I would never forget. They said ""leave it up to us from here."" As you can probably expect, we came back to a room of nothing. They had completely forgotten. I contacted them the next day and they sent us a complimentary mimosa then told us they'd make it up to us. 12 hours later, they put rose peddles on my bed.

Our favorites are the Park Hyatt and Andaz 5th Ave. but for this one night trip into the city, we thought we'd give the Hyatt Centric Times Square a try.The hotel is on 45th street about a block from the heart of Times Square. Weekends in the summer can be downright madness in Times Square in terms of the number of people on the street so being a block away provides a bit of relief while still only being a few steps from the action (if that's what you're looking for).Since we drove in, we pulled up in front of the hotel and left our keys with the bellman. Valet parking is $65 a night which is typical for just about any hotel in NYC. One of several ""missteps"" that occurred during our stay took place when we called to have our car brought up the next day. I called approx. 30 minutes before I needed my car (which you should always do at any NYC hotel), only to find a different car parked at the curb. While the valet numbers matched, the person who tagged the keys the day before had mixed them up with another guest. Credit goes to the desk associate who apologized for the mix up which added to the delay in getting my car brought up by removing the valet charge from my bill.Check-in takes place in a rather small lobby and the front desk always seems to have a lot of activity going on. There didn't appear to be a dedicated desk for World of Hyatt members to check-in (as is found in most Hyatt properties), although when I got up to the front of the line, there was a small World of Hyatt sign in the middle of the front desk however that position was just checking in the next person on line. After waiting several minutes in line and then for an available room to be found (it took several trips from the front desk into the back office for the associate I was working with to get a room), the entire check-in process was around 15 minutes.I had reserved a corner suite with what was described online as a ""breathtaking view of Times Square"", however in reality, the view from our 42 floor room looked downtown between two buildings. You could see a little bit of Times Square if you looked down and to the extreme right but I would hardly call it breathtaking. I assume that the corner suites on the opposite side of the building which are positioned more advantageously facing Times Square might actually have a better view but since I was here for one night and it had already taken a while to get this room that I'd just stay put.By definition I guess you could consider this a suite since there was a separate living and bedroom space but this was by far the smallest suite I've experienced at any of the Hyatt properties in NYC. Being a regular Hyatt guest, my expectations for the Hyatt Centric were not the same as they would be when staying at the Park Hyatt, Andaz or Grand Hyatt but still this was a pretty small suite and I'd say not worth the extra cost over a King room. With that said the room was certainly comfortable enough with ample storage space, two large TV's, and had a nice size bathroom with a ""wet room"" (shower and bath tub enclosed in the same area), with great water pressure. This can sometimes be a problem on high floors.Along with small gym and a spa, the hotel has two bars and one restaurant. Bar 54 is the rooftop bar on the 54th floor with nice outdoor views of the city and T45 is the bar/restaurant located just off the lobby and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. After having lunch the day we checked in and breakfast the following morning, I agree with many of the other reviews found here on TA that the quality and service is still questionable at T45. Our lunch was fine albeit it overpriced for the small portions offered but the service was prompt (although the restaurant was almost empty), Breakfast next morning was another story. The restaurant didn't look overly busy (there were more than a few available tables), but it took almost 45 minutes for two breakfast sandwiches and a bowl of fruit and when they did arrive, one was stone cold and utterly tasteless and the other looked as though it was just thrown onto a plate and was falling apart. As a Hyatt Globalist your provided with a $74 credit for breakfast and our two sandwiches, fruit, coffee and a latte (which was also pretty awful), came out to right around $70 with a tip. The only consolation was that I wasn't paying for this although I still expected a decent breakfast so my advice would be to go somewhere else to eat.A couple of days after checking out I received a guest survey from Hyatt which I filled out detailing some of the issues I had with the property. Within a day I heard back from Front Office Manager apologizing for the issues I encountered and offering me some additional points as compensation. This goes a long way in my book in showing the hotel is committed to improving their guests experience. Would I stay here again? Probably not and only becuase I prefer not to stay anywhere near Times Square and would rather pay a bit more to stay at the Park Hyatt or Andaz 5th Ave.. Even with a few missteps the rates against other other hotels I've stayed at in the Times Square area (Marriott Marquis, Renaissance Times Square, The W), were $100-$300 less per night at the Centric compared to these other properties and the overall experience was better at the Centric.","Hillsborough, New Jersey",497,4.0

That is a minor complaint, especially when there was a great desk across the room with extra outlets, but I do love to charge my cell phone and set my alarm while it's within arm's length.

I was happy to see the staff and accommodations were all as great as they were on my previous visits.This is certainly a great hotel with a fantastic location. Just a block off of Times Square and a couple doors away from the best Irish Pub in Manhattan, Connolly’s.I highly suggest that if you're going to visit NYC to not only book the Hyatt Centric at Times Square, but also upgrade yourself to a high floor with the view. It's worth it! Their rooftop bar, Bar 54, has some of the best views of Times Square and Manhattan. Unlike a lot of hotel rooftop bars, the Hyatt gives preference to hotel guests. Non-guests have to sign in downstairs and gain entry with a special card. Although I recommend making a reservation, as a guest, you can just go up from your floor and will be given a table. I would suggest finding out what time the sun will set while you're there and make your way up about 30/40 minutes before. The photo op is worth it.I didn't have a chance to eat at their ground floor restaurant, but it has always been good in the past.The beds are very comfortable and having a small refrigerator in the room, especially in NYC, is a great feature. One other highlight about the room, the powerful water pressure in the shower. I’ve stayed at hotels in NY where the water comes out like a mist. Thanks, Hyatt Centric for another great stay.

The bad - Hotel asked for a $250 'security' deposit on arrival, even when you pay cash in full. I wasn't made aware of this so it was a nasty surprise having to leave that much cash with the hotel for no reason. (It might be policy in NYC but it needs to be highlighted beforehand if you ask me!) - I checked in slightly before my boyfriend and he was stopped from entering the hotel even though he obviously knew our room number and had a suitcase with him. I had to actually come all the way down to the lobby to come and get him. Staff could have at the very least called up to my room and confirm that way rather than treat him like some kind of criminal. Hotel asks to see room keys every time you enter, would understand if you were in an all inclusive resort with facilities people could take advantage of......but here it's just irritating!!!!- Restaurant does not cater well for vegetarians, pasta was mediocre and served on a strange blue plate you might find at the back of your grandmas cupboard.

My wife and I booked this trip in January and were just coming to go to dinner and see a show. I booked a King room with city view as we wanted to experience the view. We arrived at 12pm and checked in; understanding our check in was 4pm. I had our luggage stored while we went for lunch and did some shopping. He front desk staff said they would call when our room was ready. We stopped back in3 separate times but was told it would be ready at 4pm. I then checked with the staff at 3:55pm to see if it was ready, it was not and they said they had an issue with housekeeping and that our room was not going to be ready and really did not know when it would be ready. I let the staff know that I had a dinner reservation for 5:30pm and tickets for a show at 8pm, I let them know I was celebrating my wife's 40th birthday. The staff said they could get us into another room but it was not a room with the view I paid for. I expressed my displeasure and they offered my wife and me the option of getting a shower in the spa. That was unacceptable with me as I paid for a room with a check in at 4pm. I asked to speak with a manager and the manager came out and apologized offering the same options as the front desk staff, she let me know that the linen delivery did not come at 4:30am but came at 2pm and that was the issue. My response to her was I understand the issue but it was not my issue as a paying customer, I did not receive what I paid for. I had met the hotel Operation Manager while sitting at the bar at 2:30pm and he let me know if I needed anything to let him know. He walked by after my discussion with the manager. I informed him of the situation and he said he would see what he could do. 4:20pm now and I was visibly upset with the situation as many other customers now being told the same thing we were being told. I asked him why no one told us this issues the 3 previous attempts to check-in. I let him know I am a Hospital Administrator, staffing and operation issues are not customer's problems, he agreed and said the only thing they could do is put us in another room without the view that I paid for. Not wanting to miss the dinner I had set up for my wife's birthday and making her feel any worse I agreed to the other room. (Disappointing view) The operation manager did offer to cover any drinks or restaurant charges for us which were a nice gestures. Let's fast forward to 12:00am, my wife and I were at the Sky lounge after our show to see the view that I had paid for and a fire alarm went off. The staff said do not worry this happens all the time, as a family who recently went through a house fire and lost everything, we were very worried about being on the 54th floor with a possible fire. We went to our room to get a few things so we could start heading down the stairs. At 1:15am the FSD cleared the alarm, appears a cigarette in stairwell caused the alarm. We went back to the room and went to bed around 2am and were woken up again at 4:30am to another fire alarm. We went downstairs again in case there was a fire and when we arrived, the lobby was full of panicked guests and children crying. The staff member who greeted us said go back to your rooms, there is nothing wrong just alarm and Fire Department is investigating the alarm. This staff member was so rude to guests and had no empathy for anyone. FYI, the FSD never gave an all clear as the fire annunciator malfunctioned causing my wife and I to not get any sleep. After this evening of terror my wife and I decided to take the offer given by the Operation Manager to cover any cost in the restaurant and have breakfast before checking out. I stopped at the front desk to let them know of the offer from the Operation Manager and find out how we needed to get that covered. The man said just charge to your room and we will take care of the charge. My wife and I had breakfast, charged to the room and then we checked out at 11:30am not wanting to stay till our 3pm late check out. When I arrived home last evening I checked my bill that was sent and my breakfast charge was charged to my credit card. My Hyatt experience has been the worst hotel and customer service experience of my entire life! Of all staff members we interacted with only one smiled and was polite, that was a man outside at 5:20pm on Saturday who was kind enough to help us get a cab to go to dinner. I hope this feedback helps you improve on these inadequacies of customer service so your brand may be able to recover with others for a multitude of missed opportunities.","Winchester, United States",0,1.0

We had tickets to The Lion King which was a stone's throw away. The hotel itself is just around the corner from the Times Square we all see on TV. I chose this hotel because it was close to the Minskoff Theatre but didn't realise how close it was to Times Square. It proved convenient because we could sight see and walk up and down Times Square and return to the hotel in a few minutes. The broadway show Aladdin is also nearby. Our view wasn't great. Just boring buildings but that wasn't why I chose the hotel. The staff are friendly and we liked our room. It was clean and modern. They offered so many freebies. The bathroom floor was heated. I ordered buttermilk pancakes and a veggie omelet and everyone thought the food was delicious. it was delivered promptly and was hot. They also offered umbrellas which came in handy. The umbrellas were in a bin in the lobby so you could pick one up as needed. We also needed a few things and those things were delivered promptly. The room had an iron and ironing board, a coffee maker, and free water as well. Since we were only there for one night, we were unable to take advantage of all of the amenities. I peeked at the gym and it looked great. We didn't have a chance to see everything else but you can't beat the location. would've loved to see the rooftop bar but we didn't have enough time.

The room was awesome--modern, clean, and quite large for the Times Square area, with a great view, including One World Trade building. We also enjoyed several meals in T45, the hotel restaurant--the food was good, the wait staff handled our special requests happily and accurately, and we even got a great sightseeing tip from our waiter that we used that same day! Checkin and checkout could not have been easier, and again the staff was friendly and efficient. I can't even complain about the elevators--they zipped up and down so fast to our 52nd floor that it made our ears pop! And you can't beat the location--just a block from Times Square.

All of the staff were very cordial and accommodating. The night before we stayed at the Hilton Conrad NYC which is a 5 star hotel and it was nice.

We booked a Deluxe View King which was amazing! We were in room 4902 which gave un-obstructed views all the way down to the Freedom Tower. The room itself was a great size, especially in New York, with a huge very comfortable bed, a modern tub chair, coffee table, a writing desk and chair. The hotel also provided bottled water, and a Keurig Coffee machine, with Starbucks coffee, all of which were replenished daily. The bathroom was a good size, with the sink and vanity separated from the rainfall shower and bath tub, by a full glass wall and door. The toiletries were supplied by the on site Marilyn Monroe Spa, and were a lovely addition. Besides the room and the great views, what makes this hotel very special is the great staff. Upon originally checking into our room there was a problem with the AC, which I reported to the front desk. The lady I spoke with apologised profusely, and said she would have someone from maintenance look at it immediately. We left the room for a couple of hours, and upon our return the AC was working perfectly. We also received a knock on the door from Brian the maintenance man to check that everything was ok, and to give us a note and a chocolate hammer, a really nice gesture I thought. I also received several emails from Alex DeChagas, director of operations throughout our stay, to ensure we were enjoying our time, which I'm not sure if it is just for World of Hyatt members, but definitely shows that the excellent customer service is led from the top. The other great feature of this hotel is the roof top bar, which has an outside terrace with fantastic views over the city.

In Manhattan this was dirt cheap for what it provided (considering that some hotels run $2000.00 per night, my daily rate of $315.00 was very inexpensive for the quality of the property and staff).We were in an exec suite (about 600 sq. ft with a separate bedroom and sofa bed). Tasteful modern decor. Nice bathroom with big shower (rain shower, no less). I am very hard to please on bed comfort but I believe most people would find the bed pretty comfy. Sofa bed is a sofa bed but it was more than adequate for the kids. Room was in very good repair as was the entire property. Housekeeping was excellent in the room and throughout the property. Considering this is NY city and we were right near the elevator, noise level was quite tolerable and I am sensitive to noise. Also be aware the hotel was packed as we stayed July 4 weekend so the service comments take on additional meaning.There is a spa but we did not use it. No pool for the kids :-(.Location is about 1 block from all of the action so there are A LOT of people around.Dining from room service and the restaurant was solid.

I was so stressed out because of the overwhelming amount of hotel options NY has but thank God I read a review and took a chance with Hyatt Centric and I literally felt like 5 star service! The view of our room on the 50th was just breathtaking. The staff and Alex DeChagas Made us feel first class! He is very accommodating and we traveled here for our first anniversary and we walk into our room with a dozen roses and a champaigne bottle. The location is just so convenient , after walking all day you are very tired and achy, it's nice to take the subway whether you are updtown or lower manhattan and being able to exit 42nd street. You exit 42nd street and walk a few streets up to 45th and boom your there. The lobby had this great scent everyone we walked AC cross it. There is a rooftop bar as well and we took advantage of the Marilyn Monroe Spa at this Hyatt location and wow!! It was a 50 min couples massage and during the massage I felt so relaxed I think I slept and woke up.

I went on to my Hyatt World app and randomly picked a Hyatt. Having this app I have learned to save my points and on level Discoverist in case I might need free upgrades for trips like this. I didn't really know where I was going or the location of the city that I was headed to so I picked this one because the price difference was cheaper. So I decided to take the $20 blue shuttle van instead of a taxi from LaGuardia to this Hyatt. Great decision! I was just stunned of the location of this Hyatt just a block from Times Square. All the lights were bright and knew I found the right place. Just walking in and knowing that I think I picked a decent place was a 1st impression. The Bar 54 in the Hyatt was exciting and lounge was decorated fancy. I then checked in with the nicest, I mean nicest and friendliest and helpful person I met on this trip. I was placed on the 51st floor (like I said those free upgrades help) and literally I was just WOWED!! The room had everything that was needed. But I must say the view rooms are just breath taking and I couldn't move past how nice and upgraded the bathroom was with shower and tub in the glass. The Timeless Marilyn Monroe products gave it the correct Spa feeling in the bathroom. This Hyatt staff, location and all together property is well beyond my expectations. They were kind and helpful in any way for directions and advice. Everything was in walking distance. This trip was fun, productive and worry-free thanks to this Hyatt.

DeDe was very warm and welcoming. This hotel is fairly new. The room decor is clean and modern. The bed comfortable and crisp. The bathroom is sleek and complete with tub and shower with a rain fall shower head. The room comes with a Keurig coffee maker and Starbucks pods plus a mini fridge! That made my day alone until I noticed the hairdryer. Ok, I'm a girl and a good hairdryer can make or break a good hair day. Hotel hairdryers are usually 100 years old, cheap and weak. The Dry Bar hairdryer in my room was a salon quality hairdryer! I finally had a good travel hair day! Now for the spa! The Marilyn Monroe spa was a real treat. Expensive? Yes! Worth the splurge? I think so. The spa is small, but has everything you need to kick back and relax. Friendly staff and Elizabeth gave me one of the best relaxation massages I've ever had.

The facilities are great, nice room with a very nice view, nice location but I have found the service quite poor. On my arrival the room stinked of smoke..i didn't report it just left the windows open for two days and it was okay. On the second day I was late for work wanted to get a taxi, i asked Louis if he could fetch one for me. He started playing with his phone, finished a conversation with another member of staff..wasted a bit of time. When I pointed out that I was late and perhaps it was easier if I got it myself he said he was checking on his phone if he could get me a ""better deal"" with a blackcar and quite shockingly he said it would have been 85$ for a 5 minutes ride. I told him that the place was very near and that normally I would spend 10$..i then went to get a taxi myself totally unimpressed by his attempt to trick me. Another negative experience was at the bars - i had breakfast every days at the 5t4, service very slow even when the bar was empty I always had to ask for sugar, spoon, water..at the skylounge even worst, we were asked to share a table with other two people that we didn't know but we were brought only a bowl of nibbles. When we pointed it out the same waitetress replied very rudely that she didn't remember that we were not together, then made us wait a long time, came back twice to ask what we ordered. The situation was so surreal that we even laughed about it with the strangers that were sharing the table with us. On the third day the wifi was down for the entire afternoon, called the reception to ask what the issue was they replied in an unapologetic manner like we had bothered them saying that they were trying to fix it..i went to the gym and there was no water, had to come back all the way up to get the water....the gym equipment was also that cheap american brand and not technogym..when I checked out at the end of my staying they asked me how it was I said it was so and so but Victor didn't bother to ask why. Overall for 450$ per night I was expecting a bit more to be honest, I stayed previously in other similar hotels in the area and the service was soo much better! i don't think I ll go back or I would recommend it to anyone, it's a pity as I generally like Hyatts but not this one!","Ferrara, Italy",19,3.0

Booked a deluxe room with city views...where the beds directly faced floor to ceiling windows..when my husband checked in, they told him the room that we booked wasn't available (!) and had upgraded us to a suite...sounded great but when he got to the room was on the 20th floor with no views (facing an office block) . My husband rang up and said it wasn't good enough as we had paid for a view...they then moved him to a higher room but was a standard room and not deluxe which again he said wasn't good enough. So eventually moved him to the 52nd floor suite (only 53 floors with the 54th being roof top bar) . Room was nice...but when I got there was still not happy we didn't get a room where the beds directly face the windows. But fine. When I checked in , I found the staff to be not friendly...the woman on reception was rude and not pleasantries or warm welcome. Had attitude. Didn't tell me anything about the facilities in the hotel.. no one offered to help me with my luggage. Very poor first impression and that stayed with me for the entire stay. No idea where concierge desk was until next day when we asked for a map..and even then they gave us a wrong map and gave us a metro/train map! Carpets in room didn't look very clean and power in shower was not strong. Didn't eat bfast as not included in room rate so better off going to cafes in NY. Had a coffee machine in room...which only had limited number of supplies...green tea and 2 coffees. I'm sure you could ring down and get some...if you don't mind 15 mins wait ...and they provide Starbucks paper cups (!!!) instead of proper cups....this was a Hyatt!!! Room included iron, dryer (was good) , robes and slippers. Free bottled water in room each day. TV /remote was not user friendly and took a few mins to come on each time. Great views from the room but expect that on 52nd floor. Roof bar which was nice and attentive staff but rained the day we went up so didn't sit outside. Location literally 1 min from Times Square and 10 mins to Rockefeller Centre and 20 min max to Central Park. Good location. We also walked to the High Line, Greenwich village, West Village and Meat Packing District. Overall had higher expectations and expected better service from the Hyatt...especially since I had checked out from another hotel arranged by work during the week to stay here at weekend...wasn't particularly worth it. However had we received good service may have thought otherwise. Whilst I was waiting to check out, a guy on reception was checking someone else in and the service he gave that woman was great, giving her details of the facilities available..which I didn't get. Marked difference to my experience. Doorman helped us get a taxi when we left and helped with bag...finally got some attention as we left! Rated it 3 (average) due to views...without that, would be rated a 2 (poor). ","London, United Kingdom",47,3.0

By NYC standards, it was large (though not huge), the layout and design was excellent - two nightstands with multiple plugs, a large closet, a nice dresser and desk area, large closet with robes,excellent set-up in the bathroom, which was very well sound proofed (unusual in any hotel we have stayed in). The construction of the hotel seemed very solid - we were not disturbed by noise at all - from the city below us, or, other guests around or above us. Bed was very comfortable and it was a good place to come back after a busy day in NY with a wonderful view from the 28th floor. It is very close to Times Square - both a positive (if this is where you want to be) and a negative, only in the sense that it is a very congested area of the city.

We had booked to go to the Theatre and therefore wanted to stay nearby, so Times Square it was. The Hyatt Centric Times Square is very modern with all the facilities that you would expect in a relatively new hotel, such as accessible power points by the bed to charge your smartphone. We chose a larger high floor King room which was a good size by the standards of downtown New York. The room was on the 51st floor and it had a good view south down Manhattan. We were amazed by how quiet the room was; the noisy sirens that regularly pass through Times Square barely registered. The bed was large and very comfortable and it faced the floor to ceiling windows, so you can enjoy the view from the bed but bear in mind that a couple of tower blocks overlook the hotel. The only minor problem was the awkward positioning of the television at the side of the bed. It could be swung out to improve the viewing angle at the expense of partially obstructing access to one side of the bed and in the afternoon it caught the sun and could only be watched with the curtains closed. The bathroom was a generous size, spotlessly clean, and had both a shower and a bath. The bar on the 54th floor is expensive but worth it for the view and we had very good breakfasts and an excellent pre-Theatre dinner in the restaurant. A word of warning about the billing in the bar and restaurant, as is common in New York the bill suggested tip amounts corresponding to 15, 18 and 20%, but in the Hyatt Centric the amounts are worked out on the total amount of the bill not the pre-tax amount which is the correct way of doing it.

I started with a weeks’ worth of review Hotels On Trip Advisor, reading reviews etc. On the sixth day I narrowed it down to ten hotels. From there I narrowed it even further based on location and proximity.My end result was three hotels located in the Times Square area, which is where we wanted to be. Keeping in mind New York is not the most budget friendly place to visit so if I was paying I wanted to be sure the amenities were there and I wouldn’t be chastising myself later for a bad decision. So I bit the bullet and registered at the Hyatt Centric Time Square, within 2 hours of me registering on line, I received an email from the Director Of Operations Alexander Dechagas. It was the common return email – thanks for registering with Hyatt. However I had allot of questions about the Hotel, transportation from Airport. So I hit the reply and sent Mr. Dechagas a simple email asking where the exact location of the Hotel is and how far from Time Square. Not soon after I received another email back, Alex gave me the exact location and three options for transportation from the airport. Like many of us it’s sometimes hard to put your faith into someone else and the decision making but after numerous emails between Alex and myself he finally said, No worries on anything – my team is ready for your arrival I got this covered. With that I changed my focus on our 4 day itinerary and left the rest in Alex’s hands.We left Detroit around 8:30 and arrived at LaGuardia around 1030pm, there is allot of construction going on outside so traffic was a mess, after looking around outside for a bit we walked back into the baggage claim and there was a man standing there with a sign with our name on it. My first thought was Alex, wow wasn’t expecting that, I played it cool and told my wife, your chauffer is waiting for us. She smiled and said oh my gosh what did you do. Well off to the Hotel we went it took us approximately and hour with all the traffic but to be honest we were in a limo so we weren’t in a hurry. We arrived around 11:50pm at the Hyatt and the staff was already waiting for us, check in was fast, pointed us to our elevators and off we went. We were issued Room 4504 overlooking time square. The view was beyond amazing and my wife was smiling ear to ear. We put the bags down and off to time square so she could get the real feel of New York.So the Hyatt Centric in Time Square sits about a 3 minute walk off 45th street, once you get on the corner you are literally in the middle of Time Square. Our room was a mini suite with a king size bed, small living room and huge bathroom, it may sound expensive but honestly it wasn’t too bad – especially for the location we were at. I posted pictures in this review of our room and view. The hotel is very clean, very friendly staff. The only improvement I can comment on was the morning breakfast at the hotel. Our food wasn’t cooked properly and it is on the high end of the cost chain. Other than that I would really have to search for any other issues. As aforementioned the staff was incredible.Steve and Walter worked the front doors, assisting customers with luggage, hailing cabs always smiling, very friendly very professional these two guys were absolutely awesome, Abigail Kahl (Office Manager) at the front desk was undeniably the highlight of the mornings, always smiling greeting us and other guests as we walked by, asking if there is anything anyone needed offering assistance with directions, I can go on and on, she had everything covered.Check out was just as smooth as the check in, I actually did it on line before leaving our room, dropped my key the box walking out the front door and there was Steve and Walter waiting for the baggage interception. Perfect play all the way around.If you plan on visiting New York short or long term I strongly suggest Hyatt Centric Time Square – if you do tell Alex, Abby, Steve and Walter – Steve and Mary say hello This is the best service team we have encountered in a long time and they have raised the bar considerably – tough act to follow that’s for sure On a scale of 1 – 10 (10 being best) here is how I rate the Hyatt Centric Time SquareHotel Service = Solid 10Hotel Location = 10Room Décor = 10Room Cleanliness = 10Housekeeping = 10Hotel Restaurant Service = 7Hotel Restaurant Food = 3 Hope this helps if you’re traveling, please feel free to ask any questions Ciao for Now – Steve","Allen Park, Michigan",318,5.0

It feels more like boutique hotel with a small lobby and only about a dozen rooms per floor, but 54 floors high. The rooms and bathrooms are reasonable in size for Manhattan, especially Times Square. I've stayed in the suites, which are relatively small. The floor to ceiling windows offer nice views at higher floor rooms as well the rooftop bar. The decor is clean and modern, but not trendy. Service has always been good during my stays. Also, the dining at T45 is actually very good.

This is our first time staying in a Hyatt Centric. This property has a more boutique feel and doesn't seem like it was designed for family travel but hotel employees have all been very friendly and accommodating, in particular the front desk. Service has been wonderful.The location is literally just a few steps away from the craziness of Times Square, convenient for Broadway shows and the subway. There is a Roommate hotel next door. The rooftop bar seems very popular as evidenced by the number of people holding special key cards to take the elevator up in the evenings. As far as we've noticed the hotel seems to have one or two attendants checking to make sure people going up the elevators are either hotel guests or patrons of the rooftop bar holding the proper access key. Room size is in line with other NYC hotels with a modern decor. Our standard room has two queen beds, a mini fridge, small safe, Keurig machine, spacious shower (no tub). Our only complaint is the cleanliness of the room. When we arrived many of the areas of the room were quite dusty. One area of the desk had a layer of white particles on it. The metal shelf under the mirror in the bathroom also had a visible layer of dust as did the shelf above the bed. So far none of these area were addressed by the housekeeping that came yesterday. Worst of all though was the pair of dirty left behind underwear that the kids discovered next to the standing lamp. Really?! Yech.

Not so this time around. The hotel hasn't aged well. One of my drawers easily came off its runners. My colleague had a laundry list of things wrong with her room and didn't have time to get management to fix them. I think it has gotten fairly hard usage from tourists.Also, I stayed here for business. It's nicely located for tourists, just a half-block east of Times Square (so you don't have to cross Times Square, which is a zoo, to get to your hotel.) A half block from 6th Avenue and three blocks north of the 42nd St, subway station (Lines 1-2-3-N-Q-R-W-S and B-D-F-M a block away at 42nd & 6th.) So the location for transport is excellent. Three blocks north of Bryant Park, too, which is among my favorite places in NYC.The problem for me (up at 6:30 and meetings each morning ) is that, on each of the four evenings I stayed, late night revelers woke me up around 2 a.m. as they stumbled back from partying. One night a man in one of the adjoining rooms got into a screaming fight over the phone with someone.The staff were excellent however, from the front desk ones (I'm a Gold Passport member and they treated me well) to the lovely and efficient housekeeping staff. The room was clean, modern, the bed very comfortable. One must close the curtains at night or the lights from the giant signs in Times Square can keep you awake depending on how your room is oriented (I was on the back of the hotel and my bed was on the east wall. If you're on the back and the bed is on the west wall, as mine was during my 2014 visit, it isn't a problem.) The gym is well-appointed.I plugged the steam iron into the desk outlet and it wouldn't heat up. I called housekeeping as I thought the iron was broken. The attendant kindly pointed out that the desk outlets are low-amperage and I should plug the iron into the wall socket underneath the desk. That fixed the problem.

The hotel's rooftop bar offers exceptional views (from Floor 54) and tasty (if overpriced) cocktails. Staff were pleasant and helpful.

So that was good. I had a room on the 30th floor which offered nice views of the surrounding area - pretty at night when everything's lit up. The room had a large comfy bed with white linens. Slippers and a dressing gown were provided in the very large wardrobe which was handy. I really liked the coffee machine in the room, which came with Starbucks capsules. I personally don't enjoy the basic Nespresso machines usually provided in hotels, the taste of the coffee from this machine was much nicer. My only quam is that no tea was provided - although I was told just to ask for it if I wanted it. As I was constantly out and getting back late, I didn't bother troubling them for it, but I feel they should've just put it in the room to start with. The room had a fridge in it which was empty, so it was handy for storing some drinks and snacks if you're up early the next day. The wifi connection was pretty good - no problems there. Check-out time was 11am, which I think is quite early! But I suppose I could've asked if there was any leeway. I would recommend staying in this hotel.","London, United Kingdom",20,4.0

Unfortunately, this otherwise wonderful resort with a full spa, and gorgeous roof top bar, is severely lacking in one area. Food. Room service, specifically. Like many hotels, their room service menu is shamefully overpriced, but what is particularly shameful is the method in which its delivered. Small portions squeezed into un-environmentally friendly plastic containers and paper bags. No plates. No linens. No silverware. No class, whatsoever. And absolutely NO jam for your toast (no matter how many days in a row you request it, and no matter how often you remind them). At best it resembles the cheapest possible take-out from the most unimpressive of diners (but at posh Hotel Brunch prices). At worst, something your bland Aunt Fanny might have packed for you in a brown paper bag when she was baby-sitting (which wouldn't last any further than the nearest dumpster on the way to school).

I'd have rated as a 4/5 this hotel (not 5 because of its cost and of the rooms' size..but we're in NYC so that doesn't really count) if it wasn't for the breakfast. We (3 rooms, each with families with children) booked the hotel through our travel agency which showed ""full breakfast included"". Once we got there we found out that the ""full breakfast"" is capped to 35-40$ per adult so we had to pay for all the extras and having breakfast in a normal mid-level restaurant (the one on the ground floor) in NY can be quite expensive (pancakes starting from $17 without extras such as berries or cream...)....But what makes this breakfast time annoying is the poor quality of service: rude waiters, cleaning empty tables seems a cumbersome task that no one seems willing to undertake (long lines of people waiting to be seated with several empty tables that just needed to be cleaned), wrong orders, mistakes, food arriving in different times (2 times I had to eat alone because my family has long done because they have been served already), lack of coordination...in summary a bad experience.so I can confirm what other contributors say here: don't book the breakfast package and rather have a walk outside, it will probably cost you about the same if not less and you'll find much much better service for what you pay!","Milan, Italy",5,2.0

The beds are very large and very comfortable.All the staff at the hotel are wonderful, especially Dede on reception and Janu in the restaurant. If it had not been for Janu I would not have had much in the way of gluten free food to eat.What disappointed us was the fact that the rooftop bar was closed every night we were there for a private function. What are guests supposed to do? One of the biggest attractions of the hotel & the guests couldn't use it, very poor. The other disappointment was the food in the restaurant, very over priced & hardly any choices for coeliacs. If it wasn't for Janu I would have had 3 minuscule pieces of steak no bigger than my finger with some lettuce. Thankfully Janu found me some gluten free bread to make a steak sandwich. Add that to the burger and two drinks we had & that was nearly $100 gone, never worth it. Needless to say we only used the restaurant once because of the prices. You can get much better cheaper food elsewhere.Although our room was lovely & the staff were great, the fact that an international hotel struggles to feed Coeliac guests at a reasonable price is very disappointing.

We chose this hotel because of it's central location, close to Times Square and because it is a relatively new hotel and was not disappointed. Arrival - Had no trouble finding the hotel, although the signage is more subtle than some of the other properties on the street (head for the Irish bars and you can't miss it!). The employees on the door were polite however the lady on reception was a bit quiet which could have come across as rude but I think it was a one off as they were all very helpful for the rest of the stay. We were checked in quickly and given a room on the 53rd floor.Room - Again easy to find, just make sure you use the lifts on the right hand side if going to a high floor as the others only go part way. The room itself was clean and spacious and nicely decorated. They had even left a little card and gift for my birthday which was a lovely touch. There was a desk area with multiple connections for electronics, nice big TV and a coffee machine with free coffee pods. We didn't use the coffee but you can use the machine to just boil hot water if you have tea etc. Would have been nice to see tea included in the free options though. They provide a fridge and bottled water daily. Hairdryer and toiletries also provided (which smelt lovely! Think it was one of their spa ranges) and a great rain forest shower. Both the bathroom and main room have floor to ceiling windows which provide lovely views of the city...We often used the little chair & table in the room to watch the world go by. Room itself was pretty quiet, some noise from car horns and police etc but considering how close it is to times square I don't think you can avoid this. Only minor issue we had with the room was the heating was a bit 'off'. It often blew out very cold air when we actually wanted heat. Turned it off for most of the break. There is a heated floor in the bathroom though which was great.Location - Perfect for us, very close to times square and walking distance to 5th avenue, rockefeller centre and the tube stations. We even walked to central park. If you want a hotel out of the hustle and bustle of the city though I wouldn't choose this one. Better for tourists wanting to be close to it all.Food - we did not use the restaurant/bar at the hotel (or any of the other facilities) so I can't comment on them. However there are LOADS of options near by in various price ranges so very easy to find something. Cafe cranberry a few doors down was great for breakfast options.Overall I would use this hotel again as it was perfect for our site seeing trip.","Bedworth, United Kingdom",28,5.0

My wife kept saying that she much preferred the Hyatt in Jersey City (where we stayed last September) and I agree. The room we had was just barely large enough to accommodate a King-sized bed.

Right in the heart of the Theater District and steps away from Times Square. Very convenient. Lisa in the restaurant was very sweet and gracious. Willing to give us information on sights to see. Thank you Lisa for all that you do. The only reason for the 3-star... not 5 is because of the way the restaurant manager spoke down to his employees during their shift. I am generalizing here... I am not sure he was the manager. A young gentleman who was seating people.... always in a jacket and a tie.... Was very condescending to his employees. We had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant three different times and on three separate occasions we heard him speak in a derogatory voice to his staff. One particular episode was when he saw Starbucks coffee cup left on the counter from his staff and said....""are we running a Starbucks here now?"" This could have been a humorous remark but it was all in his tone, very condescending and you could tell that the employee scurried the cup away as if being in trouble. This is not the Hyatt Staff/Management relationship that I have come to expect. Perhaps a manager may have to instruct his employees on proper behavior but definitely not in front of a Guest staying at the Hotel. ",,55,3.0

On our arrival, things didn't run as smooth as i expected regarding credit card matters, but we were very well treated. We were assigned to 2 diferent rooms, and as we realized that one of the rooms was too small for 4 people, we asked to be removed to one the same size as the other, wich was attended. But our fridge items, that were offered to be kept in the hotel's refrigerator while the change was made, ended up missing for some hours after we asked them back. That wasn't a big issue, but it was the first sign that the hotel had very poor organization. By the ocasion of check in, we asked if the hotel would receive mail packages, and they said they would, being the first two free and that the next ones would be charged. When the first package came, it got lost for some time inside the hotel before it was delivered. The next one never made it to our room. Amazon confirmed the deliver, even with the name of the person who signed the papers at the hotel. The ladies from the front desk assured us that the packed was indeed delivered and registered, they were very nice and helpfull at this time, i could see them putting effort in looking for it, but nobody managed to actually locate it. At check out, we had a really hard time with one of the ladies in front desk who showed absolutelly no patience in trying to understand and solve the mess that was made with our credit cards during check in, and was about to charge a duplicate amount, until another one offered to check the situation and got it right in 2 minutes. Thank you Odette! What a difference a person with good will can do! When i arrived at my home country, less than 2 days after check out, i realized i had forgotten an item inside a drawer in my room. It was a brand new bag with some other accesories inside. It was totally my mistake leaving it behind, but i have tryed to reach out to one of the managers in the hotel and he has given absolutelly no help at all with this (another person told me by phone that the only thing i can do is register my loss in a website, wich i did and haven't been responded yet) or with the mail package that got lost in there, wich now he says was never delivered. It's been two days now since i first reported my loss and no answer untill now.

It was only slightly more expensive, and the tolls AND tip/gratuity was included in the price we should pay the driver. But when we get to the airport and paid the driver he tells us that the gratuity is NOT included. So why were we told it was? Is someone on commission here to sell as many car transfers as possible?

The Hyatt was only about 3-4 blocks away from Rockerfeller center. When we checked in, we valet parked and the guys were really nice and informative! We arrived early and they had our room ready for us! It is a beautiful hotel. They brought our luggage up with no problems and the room was very nice! The location was great for it was close to the theaters and we walked to a lot of different shops and restaurants. We were able to take a cab easily down to catch the ferry to Statue of Liberty! The weather was beautiful and good thing we went first weekend in February for the next week New York had a ton of snow. When we checked out on Sunday, the hotel attendants stored our luggage while we went to the Natural History Museum, we had 8 pieces of luggage. We went came back 4 hours later, we got our luggage with no problem and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait until we got the car but the wait was only 10 minutes! The valet put all our luggage in the car and back to Virginia we went. When we got home , we discovered that we were missing a piece of luggage and I immediately called the hotel. I spoke with Matthew and he was very apologetic and told me he would find the luggage and call me back. Within a hour , he called and said they had forgotten to give us that one piece and was very sorry . They were going to fedex the suitcase to us and pay for the expense since it was their error. He was very nice and understanding and he even called me when fedex picked up the luggage to tell me it was on its way!

We always like to get the king bed with balcony, even though it was really cold outside this past weekend. Although the staff are nice, they are not especially friendly. Maybe they are just trying to be professional...not complaining though. They gave us no issues during our stay and provided great service.The hotel is clean and modern and everything was comfortable, from the beds to the bathrooms. I do wish the water pressure was a little stronger in the shower though, and I do wish that the cordless phones were easier to use. There is a button on it marked, ""Housekeeping"" but when you press it, nothing happens. In fact, none of the buttons seemed to work. Later we were told to just press ""0"" instead. Minor, but annoying. And we were a little disappointed that the restaurant downstairs was being renovated, but the food was available on the 54th floor at the Sky Lounge, which is worth checking out for the views and for a late night drink if you can swing by. No kids after 10pm up there btw. Elevators are fast, staff is always around to fulfill your requests. What else can you ask for? Overall, great stay for us as usual.The location is great as it is steps away from the center of Times Square, but since the entrance is on 45th Street and not on 7th Ave or Broadway, I liked that we had a little separation from the crowds when entering and exiting the hotel. Bryant Park and Radio City are just a few blocks over as well.

Hotel is contemporary and like a boutique hotel with one restaurant. If you are used to the larger hotels, this is not for you. The staff are friendly and helpful but the front desk staff need to learn about Travellers Cheques. The first time I asked the front desk to cash my Travellers Cheque they had no idea what it was. They had to ask for the manager and the manager just told them it's like cash, all it needs was my signature. The second day I went to the front desk to get my Travellers Cheque cashed, none of the front desk staff knew what to do. They said they don't know what it was and one of them said we don't do it at the hotel. I told her that they cashed it yesterday so Yes, they do; as all hotels and most businesses use these as cash. They said they have to get the manager; then they said the manager was at a meeting and they can't do anything. I said fine but they should learn what to do when a guest brings them Travellers Cheques. I was angry when front desk staff said NO, they don't have to learn. That is poor training and Hyatt being a well known brand should train its staff better. It's very poor customer service when the guest is polite and the staff became rude because he/she doesn't know how to do something and refuse to take constructive criticism. Just because of this, I will think twice before coming to this hotel again.

Our corner suite was way up on the 50th floor. Stunning views of Times Square below and the Chrysler building and One World Trade in the distance. The ""corner"" part of the room was tiny which makes for problematic curtain rails. A minor issue but annoying. Overall the room was great, a little small compared to other suites but a decent size for NY standards. The Kerrigan coffee machine is a nice touch too and a good upgrade from the regular coffee machines in Hyatts. Nice bathroom amenities and a good shower and the view, did I mention the view? Breakfast is free for Diamond members or $25 if you have the hot buffet. It's Ok but a little underwhelming compared to other Hyatts, but the basics are all there. I was a little frustrated by the inconsistency though, on the last morning I was offered fried eggs and Cappuccino which I wasn't aware were available on the first days, oh well, not a big deal. You'll be making a great choice if you choose this hotel for a NY visit, ty to get a high floor if possible.

Totally roomy enough for us and comfortable for relaxing. I like how they had the outlets raised above the nightstand for your phone, just things like that were nice. Good shower, comfy mattress. Check in and out were both very quick and efficient. We were on the 9th floor (room 909 I think?) and it was by the ice machine which I was worried about with noise, but there was another door separating our part of the hallway from the machine, and open or closed I didn't hear ANYTHING from the hallway at night or late afternoon when we were napping or sleeping. Price was fair for the great location - off times square which is of course a touristy area (and not my favorite honestly), but since we were seeing 3 broadway shows, one each night, the proximity to the theaters was worth it for us. I also felt very safe for those who are concerned with that about being in a big city like NYC in a touristy area. Great housekeeping, also!!They have room service, a spa, and a gym, but we didn't use any of those things. There's also a rooftop bar/restaurant, but again, we didn't go ($24 cocktails is not my style).DOWNSIDES: were just that there weren't a ton of great food options around if you wanted to avoid the most touristy places (like just super tourist trap, overpriced food). We did get a great pizza nearby based on tripadvisor ratings, but the concierge recommendations seemed just to be on close places because when we looked at those recommendations on tripadvisor and google maps to walk there, they had like 3/5 stars. Odd for a recommendation. Same with chinese food - the concierge recommended somewhere to us we could call for delivery, and then when we called we were told they didn't deliver dinner. I thought this was the kind of thing the concierge was supposed to do, but it wasn't a huge downside because we just used websites like this to find alternatives. Just kind of a waste of time for unhelpful info.","Austin, Texas",49,4.0

The hotel lobby is quite small with a cafe on the side which is open long hours serving respectable food&snacks, fairly expensive but very convenient. Smooth check in and room decent, nice and clean with all the usual amenities, we booked an upgraded room for a view which was pretty average to say the least though the weather was miserable so not much lost. We always book non smoking and really didn't enjoy that next door was clearly a smoking room and had interconnecting doors, the whole floor literally stank as the people smoking in their room had the door ajar, for 2 nights the smoke was seeping in all directions, complained but hotel pretty full. Just poor to have smoking and non smoking in interconnecting rooms, never noticed it before but will make a point of checking it doesnt happen again. Maid service was a bit sporadic in terms of timing and didn't get done one day, very efficient when it was completed though. Nice hotel bar located on rooftop which was very smart, very expensive but you can understand why and worth a visit. The hotel overall is pretty good all be it not particularly big, it seems like everything is packed in together and the only thing you could say if your claustrophobic this is not the place for you.

The management was very nice, we got a upgrade on our room which had an amazing view, and Bar 54 upstairs was pretty cool. From our room, we could see the H&M building, the Empire State building and the World Trade Center. We were walking distance to so many things even though it was super cold. We walked to Central Park and we walked to dinner almost every night. The only negative about this hotel was the room service. We paid $200 for dinner and the food wasn't worth it. My wife said her dish was ""ok"", but the steak I got was horrible. The actual restaurant is undergoing renovations, so only room service was available. But with so many food options around, hotel dining really isn't necessary. That was a bad choice on our part. But all in all, we will definitely stay here again. ","Odessa, Florida",21,5.0

This was the more expensive of the two, but it was worth it for the quality, cleanliness and location.

The room configuration of a king suite connected to a queen double room was perfect for our family with plenty of space, privacy and two bathrooms. For the location and quality we found this hotel surprisingly good value. Staff were very helpful. We only ended up at this hotel after a very bad, if not terrifying experience with an Airbnb apartment we had booked. We now understand that Airbnb has some legal difficulties in NYC and we certaintly won't every try it again without doing our research first.

Good news: no bed bugs; Bad news: the terrycloth mattress cover had an approximate 12in x 12in yellowish stain in the upper right hand corner, basically where you lay your head. I immediately phoned the front desk who instructed that they would send housekeeping up to change my linens. It took 20 minutes and 2 phone calls down to the front desk before 3 house keeping staff arrived. They did not apologize for my inconvenience or for the disgustingness that was my mattress cover, nor did they speak to me while in my room. They, did however, continue to speak amongst themselves in a foreign language. In addition to all of that, one of the house keeping staff dropped my new ""clean"" sheets on my not-so-clean floor and then continued to make up the bed with them.

But customer service can really be improved. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is clean and the beds are comfortable (not the pillows) but there is so much that left me unhappy. The reception counter was always full staffed and yet they did not smile once, but only followed your request. Even tho I was there to celebrate my bday, we got charged for a higher floor room after we checked out our first room and told them we were not happy. Also, Alyssa who answered the phone after she had just checked us in said there was nothing available and after only we waited on hold 5mins and insisted ,then she transferred us to somebody else and out of the sudden they had availability (again, maybe because we were paying for it). The rest of the stay was just average, they left me a little box of chocolates (i don't eat chocolate) and a bday card. Another thing I don't recommend you do is the rooftop bar unless you want to spend $59 for 2 drinks. It is extremely overpriced and the music they play is to help you go to sleep. Bartender was great but I don't think is worth the price. Lastly, the 2 or 3 questions we had about locations, nobody in the lobby area was able to answer since they said ""they don't live there"".

It's 1/2 block from Times Square. We came here for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and that route was 1/2 block in the other direction. If you want to take in a show at one of the many theaters, do some shopping, hang out in Times Square, it's all less than a five-minute walk. And if you want to go farther afield, no worries as there is a subway station in Times Square from which you can get anywhere in the city.The rooms are good size with a very large bathroom with a heated floor. The shower is big enough for two (or more?) with a hand-shower AND a rain shower. The TVs are nice and big and get a good selection of channels in real HD (not expanded SD). The beds are firm, but also a little cushy, which is just perfect for me. The towels are plush. The rooms were cleaned well every day. There is very little with which to find fault. (If I were to complain, I would complain about elevator backups at peak periods. Maybe nothing else about which to complain.)We had coffee and dessert in the little coffee shop off the lobby. It wasn't cheap, but the coffee, dessert, and service were nothing short of excellent. The lounge and observation deck on the top floor is the perfect place for an evening drink. (Again, it wasn't cheap, but this is NYC, after all.). There is a small deli/restaurant just up the street with fantastic pastries and bagels in the morning and excellent coffee and lattes. The hotel's entrance is flanked by two (yes, two) Irish pubs and, of course, hundreds of restaurants are within two or three blocks.Now, about the staff... Everyone from the front desk to the consierge to the maintenance personnel to the room service staff says ""Hello"" and ""Have a good evening"", etc. The consierge even made Thanksgiving dinner reservations for us at a local restaurant (of his recommendation) weeks before our stay. This is a full-service hotel in the center of it all. Sure, there are many fine hotels around Times Sqaure.

There is limited signage and even though the elevators on the first floor say you can go to the 54th floor on them...if you are on a floor less than 25 you cannot get on the elevator going to the to without changing on 25 or going to the first floor.

So, I waited and pushed the button several times before deciding to go to the first floor--very frustrating.By the way, the view from the 54th Floor Bar is great. This is a nice place to have drinks at sunset and enjoy the day.I expect Hyatt to have wonderful towels and bed linens. This hotel does not meet the quality level I have experienced at other hotels in their chain. The towels were like something you would get at a 2 star hotel and the bathroom had few amenities.

I came in the weekend before to meet my mother who took the train in from Boston. The location is GREAT, if you like being less than 1 block from the heart of Times Square. Not sure that's my favorite place in the world but it was pretty cool to be that close. The international people coming in for the meeting loved it! The room was larger than others I've had in NYC and it seemed pretty recently decorated. Nice mini-fridge to use which was appreciated. I didn't find the staff that friendly, well, I should say the front desk staff. The bell staff was quite friendly. I had a weird situation when I arrived and due to a random street festival the taxi dropped me a couple of blocks away and I walked over. This guy saw me and was being a smart Alec and then, it just so happened a guy on the bell team was walking by. He could tell I didn't believe he was really with the hotel so he showed me his ID and then he helped me the rest of the way. Forget his name but he is pretty tall and bald. So that should help the manager, if they read this, to recognize him. Apart from him and another guy outside and one manager who approached me to ask my feedback (which I gave him!), I'd say I gave them an Average review vs. Very Good because of the staff. Also, on the day I checked out I put on exercise clothes and walked around until I had to go to the airport. I left my bag at the front desk. I came in to ask a question and I asked the ""security"" person inside near the front desk and it was a woman who had a pretty bad attitude. I started to speak and she pointed to the front desk and cut me off. Pretty rude. I wish I had her name. Anyway, the roof top patio is nice. I guess my main complaints were that there is no business center. There's a computer or two in the lobby hooked to a printer that didn't work at all. So if you are there for work, and many people are, you have to walk a couple of blocks away to Kinkos. It's a killer Kinkos, which is good, but they really should have a business center, even if it is small. Also, the room service...was fast enough but it comes in all disposable containers in a paper bag. I guess that's the ""in"" style now but for the prices you pay, it seemed pretty cheap to me and like it was a way to cut down on people costs picking up the trays after people eat and leave them outside the doors in the hall. I ordered cheese fries and they came with the fries in a plastic container and the cheese in another one, and it just wasn't cool to put the cheese on the fries myself. I'm sure this sounds super crazy but I mean you are paying a fortune for them, at least bring them all prepared with maybe some garnish on it or something. Although on a positive note, I saw how much cheese they brought up and I pretty much lose my appetite. LOL Anyway, again, if you are paying over $400 a night for a hotel, I'd expect the room service order to be delivered on regular plates with normal cutlery and not plastic. OH! One more thing as an FYI...they take no prisoners with your check out time. Don't play with it at all or you will be charged. Not that I blame them, but I've not seen other hotels be so strict...be careful!","Franklin, Massachusetts",80,3.0

From Newark airport we decided to find our way by taking the train and subway. Maybe next time we will try a cab, this time we hesitated as we were not sure about the traffic. Train is $13/ person from Newark airport to Penn Station in NYC and the subway one-way fare is $3/person. We bought the tickets from the local ticketing machines. The train had 2 stops and the subway was only one stop. We found Penn station confusing and ask for directions a lot. At night work is getting done on some of the subway lines and we wanted to make sure our one stop ride was not affected. The hotel is really close to the subway station through Times Square. Subway station is on 42nd the hotel is on 45th. We arrived after 10 pm on a Saturday night and it was busy. The lobby area is fairly small and Check-in took a bit longer with 3 line ups and 4-5 people in each. The lines moved fairly fast and within 15 min we were in the room. By the time we went to the 54 th floor lounge the kitchen closed and we only had some drinks and olives. The view was spectacular and the service friendly and quick. Our king room at the 28 th floor facing north had a nice view of the skyscrapers around ( without the hustle and bustle of Times Square). We actually discovered the Haven Rooftop restaurant this way and we enjoyed dinner there one evening. We counted the blocks from the room and knew exactly how to get there on 47th street. The room was clean, not too big and not too small, the bed and pillows very comfortable. The bathroom had a very efficient layout. Staff always greeted us as we were leaving the hotel or coming back. Many restaurants only a few steps away for a variety of budgets. From hot dogs to the high end restaurants. Walgreens is You can do a lot of touristic attractions walking form this hotel. A short walk to Rockefeller centre ( going north), a few more minutes to MoMA and another few more minutes to Central Park. In opposite direction Empire State Building at about 13 -15 minutes away. We quickly learnt to avoid 7th avenue with Times Square and take a left exiting the hotel towards 6th avenue. Once on 6 th we would take left ( north) or right ( south).

I chose the Hyatt in Times Square for its excellent reviews and great location and it really did not disappoint! Even before we had even begun our trip the service was just fantastic; I emailed the hotel requesting a room with a good view and bath. For the room type I had booked this was not possible but they suggested I upgraded and offered this to me for a reduced price as it was a birthday surprise which was a lovely touch. When checking in the friendly chap behind reception wished my boyfriend a happy birthday and confirmed my room had a great view and he was right! We were on the 50th floor and could see as far as the One World Trade Center, the view was mind blowing with floor to ceiling windows! We barely closed the curtains even at night time so we could enjoy it. The room was beautiful, spacious, really clean and the bathroom was amazing with a lovely bath and a shower! On the 54th floor they have a rooftop bar which we visited a couple of times for cocktails and the views there are even mor magnificent especially at night time. The cocktails were excellent too! We also enjoyed drinks in the bar downstairs as well ( they are also a bit cheaper too!) the staff in there were wonderful as well, recommending and making all kinds of cocktails for us. New York will go down as one of the best trips I have ever been on and without the comfort and service we received here it would have not been the same. Thank you so much for helping to make our stay so enjoyable and when we return to New York in the future we will definitely be staying at the Hyatt! ","Brighton, United Kingdom",8,5.0

Upon arrival my room wasn't ready but the young lady that checked me in offered to stow my luggage (which I took advantage of) and to call as soon as the room was ready which she did. Because of my delay she included a $40 credit to be used during my stay at the hotel restaurant or rooftop bar. The hotel lobby is much smaller than the nearby Marriott Marquis and the InterContinental Times Square but they get you checked in and off to your room pretty quickly. Took advantage of a 50% off sale on the hotel's suites and booked a Deluxe View Suite which I really enjoyed. The room- 4504 was very spacious and featured a separate seating area with a couch, chair and a desk right off from the main bedroom which featured a king bed and views of Times Square.

Staff was exceptionally welcoming and friendly, opening doors, helping with luggage and hailing taxis, anticipating your needs before you asked and always with a smile. Breakfast the next morning in their casual lobby-level restaurant was expensive, but no more so than one would expect of any hotel restaurant and the food was good, though not especially exciting or exceptional. Best and worst aspects were location. Times Square is bristling with energy and right in the middle of all the action, but a disaster as far as traffic, both vehicle and pedestrian.

Our room was a Deluxe King (4902), and it was perfect. We did experience a bit of a problem with the air conditioning, but the hotel got it sorted out and all was well. The second maintenance guy who came to the room even returned an hour later (as promised) just to make sure all was ship-shape. It was. All of it. And the rooftop bar? Just go. After reading the reviews and being forewarned about the high drink prices, I grudgingly agreed to go up to the bar with my sweetie on our first night in town. For JUST THE ONE. Just one drink, and one night. We arrived and got through the disinterested gauntlet that is the front desk (super yawwwwwwn), were given a crappy table, and I was prepared for a crappy overpriced drink. This, dear reader, is where the experience takes a wild and unexpected turn. I ordered a (very cold) Manhattan. I braced myself for a mediocre and overpriced drink. What I received was the BEST MANHATTAN I HAVE EVER HAD. (And I have had more than several). ::::heavens opening and angels singing:::: Oh my. I said it out loud and the bartender, who apparently has satellite dishes for ears, overheard me. We then met JUSTIN - World's Best Mixologist. He imparted to us his superpower for making drinks extra cold (and I so appreciated that he actually listened to my preference and delivered 100%), and turns out to be a lovely and interesting guy as well. And, yes, you guessed it, we visited Bar 54 every night of our stay. Spendy, but totally worth it. Can't wait to visit the rooftop bar and Justin when I am next in town.

I don't expect a lot but there was no mention of our celebrations at any point during our trip which I found a big let down. Our room was on floor 18, we could use the lower floor lifts (elevators) which were quieter than the lifts for the higher floors. A large group often formed waiting to use the lifts to the higher floors which crowded the small lobby. Small number of rooms on each floor is a bonus as the doors have a very loud closing mechanism which is a real shame for such a newly refurbished hotel to have not remedied this. Bathroom had a nice walk in shower and modern units with toiletries. There was a small refrigerator, a coffee maker along with complimentary water bottle, coffee (and supposedly tea but we never had this in our room) daily. The television is large with a wide range of channels.

Upon check in we were informed that they had a unit overlooking times square from the higher floor. However as we entered the suite my wife noticed a strange smell in the room and as it was almost around 9pm we did not call the front desk and figured we would not be spending much time in the hotel. The next morning we asked about this strange odour and they offered to clean the room with their ozonator, to their credit they did this right away and the housekeeping manager was very pleasant and understanding of our situation.However when we returned that evening the odour was still present and we asked to then move rooms which they did the next day. The front desk manager was kind enough to offer us another unit on a higher floor. Oh and don't bother mentioning to them that you are celebrating anything as nothing was mentioned to us during the duration of our trip, not even a card in the room which would have been a pleasant surprise.

THIS is an excellent plan. Given that this hotel has the bar with best views of NYC and specifically, Times Square, we had a New Years Eve experience without the $1,500 price tag! Because the checking in and checking out was so difficult given security for Times Square celebrations, guests were asked to kill some time in the roof top bar with complimentary photographers, pastries and beverages. We got to enjoy views of the ball a few hours before it would drop and we never had to wait in a security line as we were already checked into the hotel. We grabbed our car around 2 and had very little traffic getting home. The days leading up to that, we had a fabulous location for visiting all the Xmas sights and sounds of NYC. This hotel is contemporary, quiet, clean, comfortable, offering valet parking and amazing views. The prices were excellent given all of that. If you go during Xmas, definitely consider this spot.

A member of staff came over abrupt and sharp asking us to move. I felt that her approach could have been better since we did not know and it was our mistake.

We'll definitely return to NYC as it's one of the best cities I've been to (and I've been to a lot of Asian cities) but we would try somewhere else. And that's coming from fairly devout Hyatt clients. Hope this helps you make your decision somewhat. Cheers.,"Balmain, Australia",18,3.0

Most reviewers have covered the ground on this hotel, so I won't go over it all again. The priorities for us were a good location, and this really is a hotel near Times Square unlike some that have Times Square in the name that turn out to be some distance away. That said the room we were in was quiet and we slept well. We stayed on one of the higher floors where the rooms are a bit larger. Shower and separate bath - a good space. It was a good sized room. We had expected New York hotel rooms to be a bit small and were pleasantly surprised. The wifi - an essential for us to avoid howls of anguish from the kids who cannot, it seems, be out of touch for any time at all - was fast and included in the room price - not all rooms have this. The facilities were all good and the staff were friendly and attentive. In making the booking, my wife had mentioned that our son was having a birthday while there and we were pleasantly surprised by a hand written card and present of Fat Witch brownies. Very nice they were too. A wonderful touch.Sadly, we didn't get to the 54th floor bar with views, as our kids are not old enough to drink alcohol in the USA, but the view from our room was great and just what you'd want staying in NYC.In summary: a great place to stay and explore the city.

The lobby is more like a budget hotel lobby (small, no real lounge or sitting area), but is very sleek and modern, and the room service literally is a delivery person showing up at your door with a bag containing your order. So this isn't a true luxury hotel; maybe it's what Hyatt believes millennials on an expense account want. That said, the rooms are very comfortable with all the necessary amenities, and the location is very good.

First the highlights:Check in was a breeze. Even before my date for check in, I'd been introduced to a team of staff who were responsible for making my stay very welcome and Lauren was just a call away to meet every request. They had online check in which simplified the whole process. The customer service was impeccable, I didn't have a sour moment with any of the front desk staff even though we stayed for 4 nights. They were courteous, polite, helpful, even when they had a lot of people to attend to. There were atlas 3 of them at any point so someone always was there to attend to you. We Stayed in the Deluxe King Room and had an amazing view of Manhattan from your bed. The lighting was to the T, the Air-conditioning was great and quiet (although there was no mobile remote control and you had to stand up to adjust it on the wall, however if you set the required temperature you should be fine). There was a table and more than enough socket points, shoe space, a say, a shower and a Large bathtub which could fit me even though I am on the Tall side (6ft 2IN+). The bed also just made you want to stay in.The Lift was really fast so though we were in the 53 floor you were up and down in less than a minute. which was good. My Wife experienced the Marilyn Spa and it was an interesting experience (Though must have been a little too pricey). There was really a lot to enjoy about the Hyatt and its right there in the heart of manhattan with all the buzz in the heat of the summer but once you step into your room, it seems to just drown everything away and keeps you in a world of your own.That brings me to the downside, THE FOOD. This was the only place where I would say they had a flaw. Perhaps it was the meal we ordered but it was a first impression that left us not eating at the hotel until we left. Besides the fact that the food was pricey and you had to pay an additional 18% of your charge to have it brought to your room (which we didn't mind cos we were tired from a journey) but the Kimchi Fried Rice was too oily, too salty, and really didn't come with any memorable taste. However the deserts where great and so we tried almost every desert they had on the menu but we didn't eat at the restaurant again although there were also a lot of places to eat around the area which was a consolation. So if you don't mind the food, and you are looking for a bit of Luxury then HYATT times square has you covered. Being my first time at a HYATT, its endeared me to the brand and will definitely return and most definitely recommend this hotel.","Lagos, Nigeria",15,4.0

It's close to Central Park, Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center, the Empire State Building and the New York Public Library.

We like to pig out on Broadway shows, so the location is excellent! Half a block from the Times Square area, yet far enough away from most crowds and noise. For the price we paid, things should have been better. We splurged for a suite, which was lovely - except for an odor. Eventually what seemed to be the offending part of the carpet, near the door, was shampooed and that made a difference. The small but adequate living room and bedroom are separated by a wall and a door, which is great for us, since one is usually up an hour or more before the other. Good enough view looking downtown toward World Trade and New Jersey (remember, there are skyscrapers all over the place). The bathroom is terrific. The Housekeeping room attendants were very good (especially Katie). Someone needs to check the electrical wiring in our room (5301), as we had problems with a tea pot not working except when plugged into the socket near the floor (which greatly limited where we could put it). The desk outlets just couldn't handle it. Mentioned it to staff but no one knew quite what to do, although once we were told an electrician would try to fix things - never saw or heard from him. The cafe/restaurant in the lobby is just not up to snuff. Tried to have breakfast there twice. Once was not good. The 2nd time (on a Saturday) was a disaster. Luke warm (at best) food; inattentive and inept wait staff (e.g., asking for marmalade does not mean I want strawberry jam). Be aware there is no lobby to speak of, and no Hyatt club room. We knew that because we stayed at this Hyatt last year. We had some problems then, too, but figured things would be much better with them having another year to improve.

It is a very modern and comfortable Hotel with great views over the city especially from the roof bar, a must place to chill after a hectic day with a cool glass of Chablis.The rooms are extremely clean and are well equipped with a coffee machine, TV, phone, hairdryer etc., and the air con was very efficient even in the intense heat, amazingly given the location the hotel was relatively quiet and both nights I had a great night sleep, although that may also have something to do with the very comfy bed. The food was fine and the staff very helpful, the only down side was that the drinks were very expensive........£28 for two glasses of wine!It was my first trip to New York and I have to say that I was quite shocked at how expensive it was, far more costly than London prices so be prepared to spend. I didn't get a chance to do a lot of sightseeing, but we did manage to go up Freedom Tower which replaced the north Twin Tower which was a very mixed experience bearing in mind the events of 9/11, but as this Tower was built in remembrance by people who were involved in the tragedy I am glad that we did this. The views from the top are amazing and the restaurant at the top was very good. The trip in the lift was something else as well..104 floors in less than a minute!!We also went to the Waldorf Astoria - wow but take out a second mortgage!, and visited Maceys', although I found the latter not particularly special and was like a tired English department store, I believe Sak's and Bloomingdales are more premium.Getting around the city was relatively easy with plenty of the famous Yellow Cabs , but if there are 5 of you it is better to call an Uber which can take more passengers but is still expensive. I went back in one of these to the Airport in New Jersey - approx. 20 miles and the cost was $140.Overall I loved my trip, Times Square is crazy, crowded and somewhat a little tacky, but the rest of the city is majestic in it's architecture, I would definitely go back again and stay in the Hyatt, but the next time purely to sight see!!",Lytham St Annes,25,4.0

It's a several block walk to the ACE lines from here, whereas the Westin is right next door. Room was fine, with a nice bathroom with modern fixtures and fittings. Air conditioning was a bit weird, room was really hot, and I had to lower the temp down to 66 or so to make it actually reasonable. (normally have it at 72) this caused a pool of condensation under my door which I noticed upon leaving each morning - so maybe it was just the hallway that was hot, but whatever it did what I wanted it to, just had to have the thermostat set lower than I expected.  The elevators - urgh - often a several minute wait for the elevators, with occasional lines on the ground floor - I guess people were headed up to the bar on the 54th floor around the times I was going, but it was a definite inconvenience even with 2 elevators just for floors 25-54.

We did not try the restaurant on site, but it looked great with outside and indoor seating options.Overall, we enjoyed the service and amenities at the Hyatt Times Square and would seek out this hotel again on a return trip.

I'm a fan of Hyatt brands and thought we would stay at this hotel rather than Andaz for long theatre weekend in NYC. As expected, the rooms were modern, clean, and had nice comfortable Hyatt beds. The bathroom had a great rain shower and good layout, but bathrobes were provided on request only. Also, the wall had a full window view which was extra nice as we were on the 44th floor. However, to my surprise, service at this Hyatt hotel was a big disappointment. First (and a minor thing really), we returned to the room to find the duvet was still very damp from being washed. So much so that it made our clothes wet when we sat on the bed. We called room service and they corrected within the hour. However, the biggest disappointment was the lobby interactions. The lobby of the hotel is quite small, but always had a large group of front desk staff on duty. Unfortunately, the staff always appeared to be chatting in groups of 3 and rarely greeted or acknowledged returning guests or made eye contact. Understandable if this happened a few times and easy to overlook as we are low maintenance guests for sure. But we noticed this repeatedly during our 5-day stay and also heard similar comments from other guests in the elevators. I recognize the hotel must see its fair share of one-time tourists, but the lobby and 1st floor restaurant didn't feel like a Hyatt managed property. We did get some stares/nods from the security person at the door (Times Square area gets it fair share of homeless/panhandlers). Once a front desk person provided the wrong information when they suggested we use a public PC/printer in the lobby outsourced to non-Hyatt company for some last minute tickets. It resulted in an extra charge of $21.95 (the PC/printer was not free for first 15 minutes of use!). An Amex alert popped up on our phone, but they did not apologize for the wrong advice, nor offer to provide adjustment, and were unfriendly during the entire exchange. It occurred to me afterward that we simply weren't treated as actual guests of the hotel and I suddenly recognized there must be no formal concierge in the lobby! On a positive note, we did try the small roof-top bar around 10:30pm one evening and thought service was good. We were seated fairly quickly as hotel guests and the open air roof patio was nice to gaze at skyline (3 drinks and nuts were $75 so keep in mind). Overall, the room accommodation was nice and the hotel location great. But the service level was disappointing enough that we will stay at the Andaz our next time in NYC.","Dallas, Texas",60,3.0

Starting with Richie (FRONT DESK), who was very sensitive to our long flight and provided us with compassion at understanding. He treated us like family, always asking if we needed anything and always providing eye contact when greeting us. WoW!! I would have recommended this hotel on his service and attentiveness alone. Then there was the HOUSEKEEPING staff Glenis took me over the moon. She was the sweetest, kindest person ever. We forgot almost everything from qtips to tootpaste. She provided us with everything we asked for and always providing service with a smile. We laughed together at my Spanish, but she let me practice (always encouraging). No matter what we asked for she provided it with a smile and without frustration on her face. I could feel her sincere heart. SECURITY staff always greeted us with a Welcoming ""welcome back"" noticing the flow of people. We always felt self. They were also approachable and considerate. One time offering us an umbrella cover and also pointing our daughter in the direction towards 42nd street:) Upon leaving Jeff FRONT DESK was more than courteous.CONCIERGE: Tess worked hard at helping us enjoy the city inside/outside our new york passes. The Liberty Cruise Rocked. The final day, in a panic I realized that our car left later that day. He calmly secured our bags in a safe place until the car arrived to take us to the airport. SECURITY/BELL HOP? staff: Finally, there was Steve, the gentleman and perfect professional. He provided the Brawn assisting us with bags, directing places like FedEx, Broadway, always providing his assistance not like it was a job, but like we were family. In conclusion, if I could use one word describing our stay it would be ""Hospitality."" We saved up a lot of money to go on this girls getaway as a graduation gift for our daughter. My husband could not get off work. This trip was everything we expected and more. Partly due to the service here and the other part NYC itself. For 6 day Hyatt was our Home Away from Home, for that we are truly grateful. We hope to see you soon with my husband/daddy in the near future and maybe make it either a family affair or a 2nd honeymoon. God Bless You ALL and thank you for listening. I hope my long response lets you know how important and how much this vacation meant to us. #Chattanooga Courtesy:)","Southern Pines, North Carolina",0,5.0

Upon check-in, our room was not ready, and I was told we would be put next on the list for our room to be cleaned. Ok, so we dropped our bags off with the staff and went to explore Times Square and get some lunch. Three hours later we returned to the hotel expecting the room to be ready and it still was not. Ritchie at the front desk was absolutely wonderful at making sure we were taken care of, and he let us know the minute we could get into our room.... I just wish he would have been there to help us when we first arrived! When we got to the room, it was immaculately clean, and the view was decent. We were on the 22nd floor, and I feel if we were much lower we would have just been looking at other buildings or their rooftops. The room had windows that could slightly open which allowed us to hear the sounds of the city. We really appreciated the heated floors in the bathroom as well as the desktop fan that was in the room. I have never stayed in a hotel that had a fan... Kudos Hyatt! The elevator service was often slow and unreliable (I think one was out of order). The real disappointment came during checkout... I had a gift card that I wanted to apply to my room service charges and the staff member could not figure out. I had to wait for the manager two separate times because she did not know what to do. Finally she applied the gift card to my account and then threw the gift card away rather than giving it back to me- THERE WAS STILL MONEY LEFT ON IT!!!! In this process, I nearly missed my ride to the airport because she was taking so long. This left a very sour taste in my mouth about my experience there. I contacted the hotel regarding the issue and got the typical response of... sorry this happened, we will provide our staff with more training. I would expect such a high-end hotel to have a better system of satisfying their customers. Overall, I would probably stay here again due to the cleanliness and proximity to Times Square, but beware of the flaky customer service.","Warsaw, Indiana",73,4.0

But, I would stay away for the following reasons: (1) lax security to the guest room towers-there is a popular rooftop bar that draws lots of non-guests. There is no hotel key requirement in the elevator to prevent anyone from getting off on the way to the rooftop bar. (2) elevator service-again the rooftop bar is an issue. There are 3 elevators that service the guest rooms and the bar. The bar is so popular you wait in line just to get to your room...EVERY TIME! And, there was a private bar party so they took 2 of the 3 elevators as express bar elevators at the expense of the hotel guest. We waited 15 minutes for an elevator to arrive.

We stayed for 10 nights and the hotel was clean, comfortable and better than I had imagined. We stayed in a standard King room, which was spacious with a generous sized bathroom. There was plenty of room in the wardrobe to out our suitcases out of the way, and plenty of ledge storage in the bathroom, so we could completely unpack and feel at home. Housekeeping was excellent and really looked after us. The hotel is situated on W45th St, right between 6th (right near Broadway) and 7th Avenues (Avenue of the Americas). When you turn right out of the hotel, it is a short walk to Times Square, and you are literally in the thick of it, so location wise, you can't get much better.It was a short walk to the subway- 42nd St- which is handy if you want to get to Macy's Herald Sq (34th St) or head down to Brooklyn. The hotel also sports the highest roof top bar in NYC and although we went in March when it was still quite cold, we had a couple of beautiful, warm sunny days. A visit to the bar, sitting outside, is a must if you visit during the warmer months, but get in early, as we had to wait for a table outside.

The bathroom only had a shower cubicle but that is fine with me especially as the mirror had some magic quick clear function. One downside was the lighting was not great in the bathroom and my room was rather overlooked by the apartment building opposite.

A few things of note -- I liked the double hook that was on the wall by the TV; it came in handy to hang my bag, sweater, etc. (I wish all hotel rooms had such a hook). I also appreciated the daily 10:30 ""tour"" that was offered to hotel guests to visit the bar on the 54th floor which affords a nice view looking north toward Central Park (it costs $6,000 if you want to spend New Year's Eve there to watch the festivities below -- and that doesn't even include a single drink or food item!). My only complaint is that despite their purported ""2nd fastest elevators in Manhattan"", there were only two elevators that served our floor of the hotel and unfortunately during our stay one of those two were out of order so we frequently had to wait up to 10 minutes just to catch the elevator from our room which was pretty irritating and inconvenient (almost missed that 10:30 tour of the 54th floor bar!).","Manhattan Beach, California",2,4.0

On recommendation of another TA contributor, I sent an email to the staff ahead of time explaining we were celebrating my daughter's 13th birthday by visiting NYC for the first time. Baloo assured me he would do something special. When we arrived (early), they immediately acknowledged that we were celebrating something special and were preparing a great room for us but that it was not quite ready - I had asked for early check-in and got a very prompt reply that they would do their very best but could not promise that it would be ready by the 11am time I requested. They checked our bags with the concierge and got my cell number and said they would call when it was ready. We walked to Grand Central Station for lunch and within an hour, Lauren called and asked if I could talk without spoiling any surprises and proceeded to tell me our room was ready & they had put some special things in the room for my daughter and had a special dessert for her and would like to come and sing to her when it was convenient for us. The room was on the 26th floor, was great and had a good view of Times Square so we could see all of the lights at night. There were some classic NYC items on the bed along Keith a card signed by all of the staff. The room was extremely clean, quiet and decorated nicely. Every time we would go down stairs, it seemed someone would recognize my daughter and say Happy Birthday. And, as promised, the second day we were there, we scheduled a time and the staff came and sang to her with the most delicious chocolate dessert. The hotel is walking distance to everything!

That's not to say its a five-star hotel - it's not. It's more of a four-star, but we found nothing on the negative during the stay, hence no deductions of review stars. Arrival - Valet was easy, and got an early check in because we arrived early (arrived at 10 a.m., got into the room at noon, standard check-in time is 4 p.m.). Hotel staff stored our bags between arrival and actual check in. We took a walk to Rockefeller Plaza while waiting, and they called us to let us know when the room was ready. When we returned, the bags were already in the room. The room itself was clean and comfortable, with a great bathroom - large shower *and* a tub. No quirks with the TV, and the view was nice from the 35th floor. We had breakfast at the restaurant on our last day. All good. Staff was attentive to all our needs. Would definitely stay here again - half a block to Times Square and easy walking distance to trendy 5th Avenue, Madison, etc. P.S. It's a bit pricey, which is standard for NYC I guess.

Upon arrival we were given a room on the 22nd floor. There are 50+ floors in this hotel - so I'm not convinced the 22nd floor was the ""highest"" floor we were able to be situated in, especially reading some of the reviews here and given we were there for a special occasion.I have stayed in numerous hotels and felt the personal touch was really lacking here. Given it was my birthday whilst actually staying on property (and an email was sent before we arrived) I was quite surprised for a brand like Hyatt nothing was done to acknowledge this. Not sure if that's standard practice or not?The rooftop bar is great, however, be prepared to wait a while for the lifts. The lady who works up there was a great host, the drinks however are very expensive.The room was also extremely hot.

Also, being on the East side of Times Square makes it less congested than say the Marriot on the West. You are also withing easy walking distance of everything else in Midtown. The hotel is clean, and updated (by virtue of it being so new). However, it lacks quite a bit of the usual services. No room service for example. Also the hotel restaurant is relatively limited. Of course, when in NYC few eat at the hotel, but if on business that's important to note. The rooms are small/tight like many in NYC.","Denver, Colorado",34,4.0

I arrived late and ordered room service which included a New York medium rare steak, Caesar salad, and tres leche dessert. I received my meal in a 'to go' bag, in small plastic containers, with plastic silverware. Not sure how you are supposed to cut through a $35 steak in a plastic container with plastic silverware! I called and asked for at least some regular silverware - after 20 minutes of no silverware, my meat was hard and cold. I literally felt like I was a dog, who had to pick up the meat with my hand and take a bite! The salad was just as unsatisfying but I ate it for purpose of having some food to eat. The only good part was the tres leche. I have never called a hotel manager to complain about room service (or anything for that matter), but had to call regarding this experience.

I'll start with the pros:Good price, especially for a room w/a terrace.Great location; close to many great restaurants, theaters (on and off Broadway), and bars, and walking distance to many other attractions.Friendly, helpful staff from the front desk to the restaurant and bar, and housekeeping.Average-sized room by NYC standards at 350sf.Colorful, fun, artsy decor.Complimentary bottled water.Glass-enclosed shower w/rain shower head.Secure; they require you to show your room key when entering after dark.Restaurant, bar and spa onsite.Our request to get a room on a high floor w/views (and away from the elevator) was granted. They had us on the highest floor with a balcony.Cons:Some things in the room seemed cheap, like the shower handle (that came off the first time I showered), to the A/C control panel that flipped out and shot up to and got stuck at 80 degrees, to the phones not working. One night, we tried calling Guest Services from our room phones and cell, and their phones weren't working. Also didn't care for the tiny travel alarm clock that you could never see the time on.Rooftop bar has some of the best views in NYC, but the drinks are ridiculously overpriced, even by NYC standards. Manager seemed a bit uptight, and the music was so loud, you could barely hear yourself talk. No top sheet on the bed, so I was either too hot or too cold all the time.Strict on late checkout. Typically, we get a generous late checkout when we stay with brands that we're rewards members of. Not here. Normal is 11am and they gave us until noon. (We asked for 1pm.)Overall, the hotel met our needs and aside from the phone issue, nothing was worth complaining about at the time. Though we'll likely stay with friends next time or try one of the boutique hotels to mix it up, we would stay at this hotel again.","Dallas, Texas",30,4.0

Bathroom was cool, but first I've seen of a ""wet room"" where shower door opens to a shower AND a soaking tub, separate from sink, vanity and toilet. Linens/Bed/Towels of good quality, rug was industrial and hard on bare feet. Building is a small footprint, and easy to miss - and leaves only a few rooms per floor, making the hotel seem more intimate than it is. Lobby is deceptively small for a Hyatt, and it's only utility is check-in/concierge. Sky Bar is really special - but $25.00 specialty cocktails are a but of a stretch. Gym is a cut way above most hotel gyms - which led me to use the SPOTLESS soaking tub in the ""wet room"" after all.",cville,13,4.0

We were just off Times Square, close enough to the action, but far enough away for it to be quiet.The Rooftop Bar was elegant and sophisticated, the prices what you would expect of a rooftop bar. With very good views over the City. We didn't use the restaurant attached to the hotel, for breakfast we used the Cranberry Deli, just up the road, which was did the best breakfast. Your typical New York Deli, lots of choice for breakfast or lunch, healthy options as well as traditional waffles etc. and very reasonably priced.

Gaby and Jay are couple of hostesses who were brilliant with us, professional and friendly. The view from the balcony on the 54th floor is stunning, you look over to the Chrysler centre and all the way down to One Trade Centre. The view is even better at night when all the lights come on, a great place for some photographs. The lifts in the hotel are the fastest I have ever been on, they must be some sort of turbo lifts, fast but not unpleasant. There are normally 2 security guards, just before you go into the lifts, which is a great idea and makes you feel secure.

The Hyatt is located on 45th Street, near 6th Avenue. It is less than a block away from Times Square and about a block and half from 5th Avenue. The location is great for tourists, being near the heart of the city, but also for business people. Being New York, restaurants and street vendors, practically surround the hotel. The Hyatt also has a small cafe / restaurant.The rooms are new and modern and relatively spacious by New York standards (not anywhere nearly as big as the Marriott Marquis, but certainly bigger than the Sheraton and other competing hotels). It's the typical neutral color scheme and dark wood furniture that is the trend in newer hotels. The bed has always been comfortable. The bathrooms are well appointed and have a pretty good ""rain shower"" directly overhead.Given the proximity to Time Square, noise and traffic have not been a problem. If one gets a room on an upper floor - there is hardly any noise. The hotel has about 5 relatively small elevators - so during peak hours (e.g., when tourists are headed out for the day) - the elevators can take some time to shuttle one from their floor to the lobby.Service has always been great when I've stayed there. The staff is friendly and accommodating.

This hotel really deserves 5 stars, however I took off an ENTIRE star because not ONCE did someone offer to help with our bags or doors. No one is outside the hotel except security.

It is close to everything and the view from our room is amazing! It can get a little noisy with sirens from the street, but otherwise, it's been great.My one main criticism though, is about buying tickets through concierge. I contacted concierge over four months ago to get tickets to a Yankees game. I paid $110USD per ticket (I bought two) and had seats and everything confirmed in early January. One day prior to the game, I went to pick up my tickets. They had been misplaced. Concierge chased it up for me and told me that they were going to get my tickets reprinted ready for the game. Okay, no problem, same seats and everything, I asked? Yes, the concierge told me. So my tickets arrived about two hours before game. I took them to my room and double checked it since we had so many problems with it. They were not the same seats. Prior to heading out to the game, we went down to ask concierge about it. Firstly, each ticket was priced at $60. Concierge told me there was a brokerage fee for getting the tickets ($100!!!!!) and secondly, the seats were different because ""with what happened to your tickets, we had to get the 'best available' given the circumstances"". I was not happy because these tickets were not anywhere near as good as the ones I had booked FOUR MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND PAID $100 FOR SOMEONE TO GET! My recommendation is, of course, to source the tickets yourself.Other than the ticket dilemma, everything else has been pretty good.",Sydney,18,4.0

My mum and I met up for a Broadway trip and I arrived after a delayed flight from London to find that they'd upgraded our room to the 45th floor, which was a nice surprise (the multiple elevators are super fast and get you up and down in no time). Every bit of the room was impeccably clean, the beds were super comfy, and the room was well-stocked with coffee and bottled water. The location can't be beat as a short half-block walk puts you in the heart of Times Square (but even with all the hustle and bustle down below, the rooms are very quiet) and the hotel's restaurant is a delicious and very convenient option (and the mini-fridges in the rooms come in handy for leftovers). While we didn't spend any time relaxing in the bar/lounge on the top floor (having just eaten downstairs), the view from up top is a sight to see. You could probably stay somewhere else and pay a bit less (a very little bit, since it is Manhattan), but the great location, the super courteous staff, and the fabulous rooms definitely make the Hyatt worth the price.

The Starbucks coffee machine in the room was a good touch along with the mood\night lighting. The bathroom was very modern with underfloor heating and a large walkin shower. The room more than suited us for our stay. The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful the concierge arranged my return travek to JFK and also helped print boarding oasses for return journey. The one minor thing was when we checked in no one offered us help with our bags to our room ( although it was a short walk) so was not a major thing but after a long journey it would of been greatly appreciated. The hotel itself is located seconds from Times Square and has plenty of restaurants, bars and attractions located nearby I really was impressed with the location it's perfect.

We had planned a trip to Amsterdam to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and had to unexpectedly cancel it due to illness, so we always promised we would make our 11 year anniversary trip everything our 10 year trip would have been and more. We choose the Hyatt Times Square based on an article that I stumbled across about New York rooftop bars, as views and especially outdoor high views are something that my partner and I are suckers for. Our travel agent secured us a place in Hyatt Times Square 9 months ahead of our visit and we sat back and began to look forward to what we thought would be the trip of a lifetime. Little did we know we would come back saying that this trip was the best thing we have ever done, and that we feel that our experience and stay in Hyatt Times Square was likely one that will be impossible to top, and I mean ever. I say that very seriously. We always like to meet a certain standard for accommodation on any trip, but the stars truly aligned during our stay at Hyatt Times Square, and while normally the goal is to feel as special as possible on any given trip, I would go as far as saying that I felt like the most valued and special customer during our stay here. I even joked I felt like a celebrity to my partner.Prior to arriving, I emailed the hotel a few questions, to ask if there were safety deposit boxes, times and advice for getting to and from the airport and my email was picked up by Melissa. Melissa was so immensely helpful from the start, and I told her what we were travelling to NYC for and she was so patient in answering my likely seemingly never-ending flow of questions. I also had a query about getting some craft beer from a California based company that only deliver within the US, delivered to the hotel and Melissa helped me through turning that to a reality. Weeks before we even got to the hotel, I already felt so welcome and it really just added to the anticipation of our arrival.On arrival, having taken Melissa’s advice regarding transport to the hotel we were checked into our room and discovered that we had been upgraded to a 52nd floor Corner Suite. Words can’t describe our reaction when we entered our room and saw the view the whole way to the end of Manhattan looking out our floor-to-ceiling windows. This was so immensely above what we ever expected the standard of our room to be, and unlike anything we had ever seen before. If we looked left we could see the Chrysler Building, if we looked straight ahead we could see One World Observatory at the end of the island and if we looked right and down, we were overlooking Times Square. We were speechless for a few moments and then joked, “Well, we don’t need to go up any buildings for a view now!!” Melissa had upgraded us due to the occasion and background to our trip and my partner and I simply can’t thank her enough for helping us achieve our goal almost instantly of making sure that our 11 year anniversary was everything our 10 year anniversary should have been and more.This hotel truly is the most spectacular and lavish hotel we have ever stayed in. The reception staff were impeccable from check-in to check-out, any questions we had they answered. Our room wasn’t ready on arrival (we arrived well ahead of check-in so didn’t expect it to be), and they got us in quickly and let us know even though we had gone out for a walk, when it was ready. They kept our bags secure, they showed us how to operate the excellent air conditioning and heating system in the room and they also accommodated a very last minute request to have some orange juice delivered to our room on the morning of our anniversary to make mimosas with the bottle of bubbly Melissa had arranged for our room for our anniversary. A tip for your stay – do not go home without waking up to the fresh orange juice from the T45 restaurant bar at least once, but ideally do it everyday. It is exceptional and truly got you ready for the day. The hotel also had fabulous staff on the door later at night, who would from time to time check room cards etc. to ensure the hotel guests safety. Obviously they got to know your face, and then didn’t need to ask, but this was a lovely touch that really made us feel secure.I can’t say enough about the hotels location either. Aside from getting to and from the airport, we walked everywhere, and felt as central as you could want. Times Square was literally steps away and everywhere up and down-town was within walking distance because of your location. We felt like we were at the epicentre of the city that never sleeps, but when we wanted to sleep, we just went 52 floors up into the sky, away from the sights and sounds and slept in luxurious comfort.We also spent an afternoon in T45 the hotel bar / restaurant at a window seat just people watching while I drank Amstel Light and my partner vodka and Diet Coke! Ever since we’ve left, we just wish we were back there people watching and being merry!! The hotel TV was fabulous too, the Good Morning programs and Late Night Talk Shows became my go-to programming after a day strolling about in the heart of the Big Apple, and the best part was, we had a TV in our bedroom and one in the lounge area of our suite, if we ever wanted to watch something different!!The room we were in was so spacious without being too big so that you feel far apart if you are in different areas, and the décor was so crisp, modern and clean which I completely adore. Our lounge area was comfortable and I felt like a powerful business guy counting what money we had left each day at the desk workstation while looking out over the city. The room had a spacious fridge, lots of storage space and a wardrobe that our case fit in, which really helped keep the room look tidy all the time with any mess out of the way. My partner had access to a hairdryer and the bathroom was spectacular, with a large couple’s bath and walk in shower area, which I loved using every morning. The maid service was amazing – I joked it was as if it was performed by ninjas, as we were never disturbed, and every afternoon when we came back, our room was as if we were just walking in on the first day. I’m a neat freak and love this kind of cleanliness. The room had a selection of books and magazines too which I really enjoyed reading, one of which was pointing out lots of the stuff we could see from the hotel window view and nearby stuff to add to our to-do list. We actually had a conversation about beds when we arrived home to Ireland. Now my partner and I love our bed at home, and always consider it the most comfortable bed we ever get to sleep in, but Hyatt Times Square, well, let’s just say now our bed at home is our second favourite bed to sleep in! The level of comfort in this hotel and attention to detail is just mind-blowing.We had a pretty packed to do list and got through most of what we aimed to do in NYC, all of which was walkable from the hotel. We took in Times Square, and would recommend the Hard Rock Café for food (and particularly for service), we took the Downtown Bus Tour, walked the Brooklyn Bridge, took the free Staten Island Ferry at night, visited the Body World Exhibit, the MSG Tour, spent our anniversary afternoon in Central Park and visited the zoo before heading to the Natural History Museum and so much more. For quick lunch bites, if you aren’t in the hotel and can’t go to T45, try Just Salad in the Rockefeller Centre, or there is a busy but lovely deli a few doors to your left when you exit the hotel.Our only regret is that we didn’t get the chance to have a drink at the Rooftop Bar, Bar 54, at the Hyatt Times Square Hotel. We laughed about this as it was the reason we picked the hotel. We laughed about it more when we realised that the reason we didn’t get in was because Melissa gave us a room with such a spectacular view that we could see the view we craved from our bed!! Lol! We did peek in the bar and it looked spectacular, and Max from the bar was so helpful with answering any questions I had ahead of our visit.We also never got the chance to sample Chef Nick Pelliccione delights in the hotel either, we were just so busy seeing all we wanted to see during our stay.I could write about this hotel and indeed our experience for pages and pages, but I’ll sum it up by saying that if you are visiting New York City, for the first time or have been before, I don’t think you’ve done it properly until you have stayed at Hyatt Times Square. I can say with conviction that it was the best hotel that I have ever stayed in in my life. I can in addition say that the Customer Service, and indeed personal Customer Service, that we received from Melissa ahead of and during our stay was the most professional, exceptional and welcoming that I have ever received in my life also. While making grand claims, I will reiterate that while we always like to set a benchmark when we travel that we like to beat the next time we go away, whether it be a standard of hotel, a view, etc., I am confident that the view we had from our 52nd floor Corner Suite in Hyatt Times Square is likely never going to be beaten. This hotel, and the experience surrounding it, was phenomenal.When we are back in NYC, I know where we’ll be staying.Thanks you Hyatt Times Square for everything! xx","Belfast, United Kingdom",27,5.0

Storage for four was also a little limited, especially after a week of shopping in NYC! As said this was more due to us choosing to book just one room and not two, and was more than manageable.The room was very clean and housekeeping each day was excellent. Beds were large and very comfortable. The temperature control was also great and quickly cooled or heated the room, the latter being most welcome given the very cold start to April. The bathroom was excellent and again spotless.The room also had a fridge and safe, and free bottled water provided daily - a nice touch.The room rate we had didn't include breakfast so we opted to have breakfast elsewhere, although the hotel option looked good . There are many good value options close to the hotel - we found Cafe Europa just round the corner on 6th Avenue to cover most bases, plus if you are prepared to venture further to 51st Street the Cafe Europa does European style pancakes (crepes) too!

She did not offer to help my wife with the bags after making her wait for me to come back with the ticket.

Having stayed twice at this brand's Melbourne hotel, and having read positive reviews of this one, I booked in for all 7 nights of our first stay in NYC. I didn't realize what a treat we were in for. To begin with, the staff were friendly and so helpful throughout our stay. When we arrived and each time we returned to the hotel, we were greeted in such a genuine way and if we needed assistance with anything, it appeared to be no problem! We were given 4702. The room was immaculate, with enough space for us and our bags, although we elected to utilize the drawers for our clothes and pop our cases in the wardrobe. The Windows opened (a real hotel treat for us!) and there was a super-comfortable, King-sized bed. The height provided a great view and probably contributed to a good night's sleep, sound-wise. I could lie in bed and see clear downtown to the Freedom Tower. Looking out the window to the right was the Chrysler building and to the right was Times Square, the Paramount building and beyond that the river and Jersey. The bathroom met my demands of being very clean and I loved the layout with the bath and rain shower being separated from the rest of the bathroom by glass partitioning.The location was ideal for tourists like us. We were walking distance to almost everything we needed and if we needed to catch a cab, Luis and his team had us sorted out in a matter of moments. Being on the doorstep of Broadway was really perfect for us wanting to catch shows during our stay. There was a restaurant downstairs that we ate at for a dinner and a lunch (both delicious) and we enjoyed the rooftop bar on two occasions where we enjoyed fantastic cocktails and a great view. Unfortunately my post-Orlando feet did not find the time to try out the spa.We both ended up with pretty bad head colds in New York but, thanks to the comfort of this hotel and our room that we returned from each outing to, we really didn't bat an eyelid!I would definitely return to and definitely recommend this hotel.

In turn, Lauren arranged for a beautiful room with a great view of Times Square, a late checkout on Tuesday, and even gifted us with some incredibly delicious treats (thank you Lauren).

It was an amazing experience we will never forget.On arriving at the hotel quite late in the day after a horrible delay in immigration control at JFK we were greeted warmly and checked in very swiftly. I think the reception staff sense how exhausted we were.When we arrived in our room there was a bunch of a dozen long stem red roses and a chocolate birthday cake for me which hubby had asked the hotel to arrange. They were totally beautiful and the cake tasted amazing.The suite was good if a little basic. I've stayed in some wonderful hotels and given how much we paid I would say this is only just ok for the money we paid. The bathroom was large and we had a separate lounge and bedroom which was helpful when dealing with jet lag.Despite being so high up the noise from Times Sq was still clearly audible. It also meant that the moment you left the hotel you were in the thick of it. So if you're looking for somewhere VERY close to the action this is great, but I think if you want a quiet retreat from the craziness of Manhattan then it's is perhaps not the right choice. I would say not to bother too much with the restaurant in the hotel. There are far better restaurants just a short walk away that cost far less. We found the food wasn't brilliant and the service was a little slow the times we visited. Just a little tip, try Juniors just a 2 minute walk away for breakfast.

What's even more concerning is that, the foam pillows are in such high demand. I asked the lady who answered the phone if they regularly heard complaints regarding the pillows. I explained she must have I couldn't see how people wouldn't say anything. She confirmed and admitted they do hear complaints regarding their pillows.

I spent several weeks prior to booking checking out the hotels and finally decided on this place due to the very central location, I have visited NYC previously and stayed in the Upper East Side area which was beautiful but I found somewhat difficult to navigate around the city without using public transport or cabs ! I had an early flight from LHR, and arrived prior to the check in time which was not a problem for the staff who were great, the check in was quick and efficient which is exactly what you want after a long flight, they had our room ready. The rooms like many of the hotels in NYC are compact, however having an upgraded 'View' room meant I had a higher room (39th floor) with the floor to ceiling windows which let in a lot of light so it didn't at any stage feel claustrophobic. The hotel location is a major selling point, from leaving the hotel you could be at any of the Broadway theatres within minutes or in the heart of the action with crowds of people I found their were things going on most days, lots to see and do in the area with a wide choice of places to eat, or you can head over to Hell's Kitchen which is a short walk away.There are several Subway stations within a few minutes walk, however from my stay I would say it is a a very walkable place with Central Park 15 minutes walk, the Rockefeller Centre, Tree and Ice Rink a must see if your here over the festive period a stones throw.Fortunately/Unfortunately it was the warmest 'winter' on record so we didn't see any snow, which I was hoping for ! Lived up to all my expectations about visiting this fantastic place over the christmas periodWe went down to 'Times Square' for the Ball Drop and it was mental, security is stringent as you can imagine with people starting to enter the area around 10am as it is closed off and you are have to queue up to be checked by the police before entering the area. Great atmosphere and experience however its not for everyone as once you enter the area unless you come prepared you can't leave for food/drink or pop to the loo without leaving the area and starting the process again, so if you head down to this be prepared !

There were also dressing gowns, slippers, flannels, hairdryer and a fridge. There was also very good air conditioning, which ranged from around 16 celsius to about 32; so a good [temperature] range. The closet is big enough to hold all of our clothes (and jackets) and our suit cases. The bathroom had a very large shower, which had an overhead outlet or side outlet, which could be changed by the flick of a switch. The most impressive thing about the room was the underfloor heating in the bathroom. THIS IS A GAMECHANGER. If you get up in the night for the toilet, the tiles are not cold under your feet! My partner feels that I hold this in too high a regard, but honestly, it was great. It's one of those things that you don't realise you need until you experience it.I digress...The location was brilliant, right around the corner from times square. However, if you have never been to Times Square before then a word of warning: there are people trying to sell you stuff at every turn. Bus tours, comedy shows, boat tours, photos with people in costumes, mixtapes of local rappers etc etc. Being British I spent the first two days politely saying ""no thank you"" to everyone, but I soon learnt that it was far more effective to just walk through them without making eye contact. The WiFi is free and very good.It is around a 15 min walk to Central Park and there are several nearby subway stations to get to other part of Manhattan or indeed Brooklyn, Queens, Jersey and the Bronx.Broadway is a couple of blocks away, as is a lot of the shopping places.There are hundreds of food outlets nearby, although I would recommend heading over to Hell's Kitchen (it's the name of an area), which is on 9th Avenue, where the price is a little more palatable...There is a bar on the 54th Floor. It is very nice and offers views of the city. The drinks are over-priced, but it is worth it once or twice to finish off the evening and have a nice view of the city. There is a gym but we didn't use it.There is also a bar/restaurant on the ground floor, which we used on our last day between check out and leaving for the airport, it is reasonably priced and quite nice to relax in. All in all it was a great stay and we would stay here again without hesitation. Downsides: No tea making facilities in the room, only coffee. (however I am lead to believe that if you ask, you can get some).Late checkout is $50 per hour.","Manchester, United Kingdom",31,5.0

You can leave your hotel and be at a theater in as little as 1 minute. So many theaters are close by. The hotel itself was great, the staff was helpful and very welcoming. The rooms are small (typical to NY) but our room had floor to ceiling windows and a wet room with a rain shower and standalone tub.

The location is amazing and the service is even better. The hotel provided free wifi; valet parking; and spacious rooms for nyc. I would give it a full 5 star but the house keeping was satisfactory (I found the room was not cleaned effectively and the rooms were not vacuumed or swept daily). It was not horrible house keeping, so in fairness, I would say that the hotel is 4.5stars. There was also no doorman or anyone to help us with our bags on arrival (The front desk receptionist was nice enough to help us after our long drive, but I did feel bad asking her to lug our luggage upstairs), and valet parking did not allow in/out privileges (not sure if this is common in the city). We had an opportunity to visit the restaurant and bar 54. The breakfast at the restaurant was delicious and our server was quick to accommodate our requests. Bar 54 had a phenomenal view of the city and I am sure in the summer time, sitting on the patio would be amazing. The drinks were a bit pricey, but you are in time square on a roof top patio, so we did expect this. What truly made our stay memorable and created a total brand loyalty of us was the front staff, specifically Lauren (the front desk manager). She accommodated our needs for the rooms and went out of her way to ensure my family was comfortable and happy. We were upgraded to a beautiful room on a high floor as per our reservation. She remembered our family throughout the trip, was always pleasant and friendly to our children and continued to ensure our comfort for the 5 days we stayed at the Hyatt. I also wanted to recognize the concierge service as they assisted us in tour tickets to the empire state building and the hop on/off buses. This is a must buy at the hotels as the line ups can be horrible if you buy on the streets. During our stay we enjoyed an evening view from the rock, empire state building, WTC, memorial museum, central park and of course shopping. If you are looking for excellent dining options, check out Empire Steaks, Hakkasan, and by far the best, Balthazar (in Soho). For family style itaian, we enjoyed Tony Napoli and managed to get amazing tickets for Aladdin... I highly recommend all of the above. If you are unsure where to stays, I would totally recommend Hyatt Time Square... hopefully you will get the service we received... Please ask for Lauren.. she is amazing!

First, to note: we are a family, so our room with two queens totaled around 400 square feet, had two closets, a desk, a settee with table, and a large bathroom. The bed was hugely comfortable so we slept perfectly over our 5 nights. The elevators work well, with different sets for lower and upper floors. Our check-in and front desk experience was great, and I found everyone friendly. The empty refrigerator was a plus! We snuck upstairs to the beautiful bar (w/o teens) one night, where we had delicious drinks that were pricey but worth it. The location is good, esp. for a first time; though I tend to deplore Times Square, it was so convenient to walk three blocks to our theater show. If you decide to stay, and really like food, do some research because the area lacked immediate great food (head over to 9th and 10th or 3rd and 4th streets). The hotel lacks a huge lobby and the glamour of some hotels, but makes up for it in sleekness, modernity, and newness, which worked great for our family. The one downfall, but not enough to knock the hotel itself, was the spa experience included in my room rate--the massage experience was nothing like what a nyc experience should be like.

I put a lot of time and thought in trying to find the perfect hotel and narrowed it down to 3 as it was a birthday surprise ..needless to say, I'm extremely happy I picked this one. Here's a long and thorough review:Arrival: Check in was nice and easy and greeting was great. A nice girl in training took care of us, forgive me as I forgot her name. She went over the bar, restaurant, and the essentials of the hotel. Room: Had a king deluxe and I requested the 51st floor but we ended up on the 46th in room 4603 which was incredible! The views were breath taking and my girlfriend was blown away. Clear view of times square, freedom tower in plain sight, and the sunset over the hudson. Doesn't get any better. Room was clean, very modern, no stains anywhere, and the Bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept on at a hotel, and I had to confirm this with my girlfriend as she agreed as well. Bathroom was fantastic! Separate tub and shower and the rain shower was EVERYTHING. I just want to point out there was no water leaking onto the bathroom floor when we showered as some other guests reported. Rooftop bar: Highest rooftop bar in the city and it's amazing. If you're guests of the hotel, they'll seat you as soon as possible and they'll serve you drinks while you wait but if you have friends with you, you have to wait just like everyone else so keep that in mind. We had 8 people with us and there was a cancellation so we got right in. Be ready to spend money because it's pricey. My girlfriend and I shared a punch bowl which served 3-4 people at $69, best bang for the buck. Our entire bill was $141 which was cheap for our party and gratuity was added in. I think everyone else had beer lol. Server and everyone was attentive and friendly. Miner gripes: Being on such a high floor, be prepared to wait for the Elevators with the frequent stops. We stood there for a good 5 minutes waiting to get on. Also I emailed the hotel about the occasion and asked if they offered anything complementary and I didn't hear anything back. Not enough to dock a star, but I feel it should be mentioned. Overall: Can't beat the location, can't beat the views, this is the place to go. Plenty of Irish pubs surrounding the hotel and steps away from times square. My girlfriend was extremely pleased and even became a gold member just like myself lol. We'll definitely be back!

We wanted our children to see some of the museums, a few Broadway shows, and all the classic sightseeing spots. We stayed at the Hyatt Times Square. I was a little nervous about the location, because of potential noise. However, the hotel was unusually quiet, and we were not disturbed by noise at all. The rooms were small, but consistent with most NYC hotels. Beds were very comfortable, and everything was very clean. We really loved how pleasant and accommodating the hotel staff was to our large family. Sometimes we can be met with disapproval because we take up so much space. The Hyatt staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome every time we entered the lobby. Lots of smiles and requests as to what they could do to make our stay more comfortable. We really loved staying at the Hyatt Times Square also because we could walk to most places around the city from this central location, which helped us save on cab fares.

Rooms decently sized for NYC and comfortable. Very long list of amenities in room available to keep, borrow, or buy - pretty much anything that you could have forgotten - nice touch. Only glitch was fire alarm went off. After walking down numerous flights of steps the door to the street would not open. Several people tried it and it was only when a member of the staff came later that it was explained that one needed to get a running start to thrust open the door - what would have happened had it been a real fire?? I went to the gym for about an hour after the fire alarm had been cleared and then tried to return to my room as a fire door had automatically closed shutting off the hallway to my room and one other. I had to call down to the desk to get someone to open it - I would have thought that in the hour after the fire alarm had been cleared that staff would have gone through the building opening any fire doors that automatically close in the event of an alarm, rather than waiting to be called. Overall it was a nice hotel and the likelihood of being there during a fire or false fire alarm is small - however, my impression was that their response to a fire alarm could use some improvement.","Arlington, Virginia",124,4.0

The location is great , with many attractions well within walking distance. Times Square is a few yards away, and a 10 to 20 minute walk will put you to Central Park, Bryant Park, Empire State Building, Broadway shows etc.As it was probably going to be our only trip to New York, we had asked for a high room with a view and were delighted to get a room on the 47th floor, with a view over Times Square and looking south at the One World Trade Center. Having never been in such a high building before, we had to cautiously creep up to the floor to ceiling windows to enjoy the scene. The room itself was also very impressive - massive (very comfortable) bed, large TV, large bathroom. It was also surprisingly quiet - no sound from surrounding rooms and very little noise from the streets below.The staff were all very happy and helpful (as was almost every New Yorker we met - I hadn't expected the place to be so friendly). The rooftop bar was very good - stunning views, nice ambience - yes the drinks are expensive, but they were very good and the accompanying view makes it worthwhile. We would definitely recommend staying here, and if visiting New York, January seems to be a great time to go - never had to queue at any attractions and it's much less expensive for travel and accommodation.Tip for British people - bring your own teabags - very hard to find a proper cup of tea in New York! :-)","Shetland Islands, United Kingdom",72,5.0

Upon getting to the rooftop bar, it was packed and the host said that I should've made a reservation. Now why didn't I think of that?

A few tips for the surrounding area: 1. The subway is pretty easy to use and there is a station on 42nd Street (Bryant Park) that runs trains to most popular locations. 2. We bought the Green tour bus service, however it seemed as though it was the less frequent bus route so best to take the red bus. 3.

They communicated with me via email before my visit and made sure I had my choice of floor. I do not like to be higher than the 12th floor in hotels so I missed out on what I am sure are great views. We were on the 9th floor and it was NOISY. But, my fault and my choice for wanting a lower floor.There is a deli type cafe nearby that has grab and go items. We did not try the hotel restaurant as there was no need. The room was VERY clean and serviced every day. We were given 4 bottled waters every day - possibly part of Hyatt Platinum status? Plenty of towels. Floor had obviously been vacuumed. Beds showed zero signs of critters! The room was small but had two queens and exceeded my expectations.The reasons for 4 stars and not five are:Location: Too close to Times Square for me. The noise (typical NYC) but I might try a district further out next time. Street noise - the hotel itself is quiet. If you want to see Broadway shows it is terrific but I found the whole area just too much.Security: The staff was friendly but I would have liked to see someone checking keys or ID.

Hey we are just an average family number not a large group!Negative comments - lifts were really slow and broke down - we had theatre tickets and were trying to get two blocks in half an hour - quite stressful so we ran down several flights of stairs.And .... The absolutely dreadful greeting with our three children at 10:30pm on arrival after a 9 hour flight and a two hour transfer to be greeted with 'we allocate rooms on arrival' which is terrible pre-planning and not customer focused when we specifically requested rooms near to our children and were offered rooms 3 floors apart - night Manager was rude and perhaps inexperienced in handling our complaint. Hotel was full. Shame as we had made the request many weeks before and Hyatt knew we were coming as we had paid in full for our rooms and flights - a quick check with the airline would have notified them that we were 'in transit'. I suggest to Hyatt Hotels that you could improve the customer experience by considering families travelling with children and give them priority room allocations as they then can be adjacent or at least on the same floor. Singletons and couples can then be allocated according to preferences specified or upon arrival. Assuming you never have rooms for 5 - which you don't!

It is an ideal location for a tourist. The staff are helpful with any requests. There were a few unusual or undesirable features. For example, there is a slip which suggests what should be in your room eg. Shower cap, soaps etc. however on arrival our room was bare. I think maybe it wasn't prepared properly. However when I rang the desk she said you needed to ask for what you wanted from the list. This wasn't indicated on the paperwork however in fairness they did bring up promptly what I asked for. It was unusual to have to ask for bare essentials. Annoyingly I had to pay $5 for milk to be able to make a coffee with the coffee available in the room. The coffee provided is Starbucks and delicious. It was our honeymoon and this was indicated on our booking. However the hotel didnt do anything for us until we had to ask them if they did do anything for honeymooners. they then offered us a drink in the bar but then tried to charge us for this at check out. This was quickly corrected but annoying. They did give us brownies and a wine later too. Be warned the roof top bar is phenomenally expensive. Questionable whether it's worth it .Room is a lot more spacious than the Edison hotel. Where we stayed last time and was tiny. There is quite a lot of street noise from works in the area from early morning.So a good hotel, quite basic interior, but I think they need to pay attention to detail more. Have a room ready with the basics and make it clear that guests need to call if they want the items listed as already in their room. Also pay attention to booking details.

While the front desk staff were very friendly, it felt somewhat less professional than all other Hyatt properties we have stayed in and they more so wanted to be your ""buddy"".The whole hotel had a feeling of the kind of place college students would come to party in NYC on a weekend, in fact upon getting into our room it was exactly that in the room next door with a lot of loud laughter, loud talking and music! Fortunately the staff were helpful and moved us to a different room where we didn't experience that issue.The styling of the rooms reminded my wife and I of your average airport hotel, with drab colour and décor choices, not to mention wallpaper peeling away in a property which supposedly underwent a complete renovation a little over a year prior to our stay.We stayed 2 nights out of our 8 night booking so we didn't face a one night penalty and moved to the Grand Hyatt as soon as we could. We thought we'd lift our spirits and try the rooftop bar/lounge for a drink, but ended up leaving due to the outrageous drink pricing.

It was like spring! Seriously warm, and we found our thermals and thick coats too much. That aside the hotel is very nice. We originally booked a king with a view, but after checking in were appointed with a double queen, as we had our 7 year old with us. Much better, and more spacious, I was concerned whether any of us would get any sleep in one bed. We were on the 29th floor and found it lovely and quiet. Lifts were ridiculously fast, and we had no issue. Room was clean, had good temperature control and supplied all the tea and coffee that you needed as well as free bottled water. There's also a list of free items you can order if you need them. Room service was impeccable and though not needed, we left a couple of dollars tip each day, out of courtesy and left a note if we needed extra coffee etc. the bathroom was very swanky, stylish with a big walk in shower. I personally would have preferred a bath with a less posh shower over it, that's my only gripe, I never have time at home for a bath so having one on holiday is luxury for me. It was my partners 40th whilst we were there so I rang to reception and asked what they could do, Winnie replied that they could send a complimentary chocolate mousse cake up that was one serving with a candle and it would be waiting in the room the next day when we got in. We got in around 5pm the next day and there was no cake waiting. A quick call to reception whilst other half was in the shower soon rectified that and a card and cake(which was delicious) was duely delivered. Overall if you have to stay in times square(I personally wouldn't next time) then the Hyatt is a great choice. I just found the area very busy and expensive. There is a deli next door to the hotel that serves about every type of food under the sun, but personally I didn't find it that cheap. the hotel restaurant looked lovely, we only sampled a takeout Mac and cheese from there for the little one on the night we arrived, expensive but probably the best we've ever eaten! great security at all times who always greeted us all with such friendliness and enthusiasm.

The trip was organised by our daughter as it was my birthday and when she told the brilliant customer services team stvthe hotel thru very kindly upgraded us the hotel sits just off of Times Square so is a perfect location from which to explore the city. Our room was large and very comfortable and the hotel staff went out of their way to assist us and make our stay that much more enjoyable. The bathroom was also big with a separate walk in shower as well as a nice deep bath. With heated floor it really was a nice bit of tic after waking all around the city. We were on the 48th floor and the view was spectacular (ask for a high floor room when you book). New York like much of England was very cold so make sure you wrap up if your going in the dec-mar period. The city itself is a treasure of sights with so many contrasts in both the architecture and the people! We did the usual tourist bit and the best value for us was the New York big bus tour. It was $62 each but you get unlimited hop on hop buses with guides that cover up town and down town. A perfect way to see the sights if you've not been before. That said getting around town is much better on for as the traffic at times was pretty dreadful! Times Square in the evening is brilliant and if your a theatre lover you will think you have died and gone to heaven! A couple of minor issues that could annoy. All the guide books seem to stress thst you must tip as its expected almost for everything particularly in the service industry- restaurants , cabs , cafes etc. no surprises BUT what we found almost all the time was that in say a cafe, you order coffee and say a sandwich and when the bill comes they either automatically add upto %18 service charge or they print on the bill a recommended gratuity based upon the bill ; so you see 10% $ 6 , 15% 8 , 20% 12. After a while it does become a bit of a pain. There is world of difference in leaving a tip for exceptional service than being emotionally blackmailed into effectively contributing to low paid workers salary. After a couple of days we adopted a simple policy of lea bing $3 as a standard tip no matter where we were. The other thing is a bit annoying is how much you think something costs. If say you see a baseball cap shown St $ 15 you expect to pay thst. What you seldom see anywhere is that you also need to pay local and federal taxes which add in this instance another $2-3 on top!! Be aware. Cabs are plentiful and all yellow cabs are on the meter and are regulated . Be warned though the fares can go up quite a bit if the traffic is bad. We arrived and departed from Newarks Liberty airport and the fare to Time square was set by the can controller . It was I think $57 BUT you have to pay the toll booth charges there and back which were another $20. If your departing from Newarks Liberty airport they have a great range of shops BUT they don't take cash! You go to a pay point machine (much like you see in the supermarkets in the UK) where you scan your items thensy be debit or credit card. Final coment on the Hyatt Times Square. The only issue we had was that as we had an evening flight we were hoping to secure a complimentary shower and change facility we could use before our flight. The hotel were quite adamant they could not provide any such facility which forced us to pay over $ 189 (with taxes ) which seemed a bit harsh when all we wanted was basic wash and brush up factual. That aside a really great hotel which we are definitely going to back to.","Canterbury, United Kingdom",9,4.0

Clean and NEW. About two years old. I have stayed here many times. Very nice gym, which is clean and has lots of equipment. About six treadmills, about six bicycles, free weights, lots of room for stretching and yoga, superb gym. The gym is the key for a lot of business travelers. I wish the older hotels in NYC would get a clue on the gyms. I used to stay at Sofitel which is nearby and awesome -- but the Sofitel's gym has really run down based on a recent stay. Very good sleep quality. Showers are the rainfall kind and bathrooms a clean and bright. Quiet for sleep -- which is a challenge given NYC and Times Square outside. But it is bright -- so if you are light-sensitive bring a mask. T45 is the express diner downstairs; they do a very good job with breakfast. For something that keeps you on the hotel property, it is very practical. Not a romantic restaurant like in the Cary Grant era of hotels, but servers are always nice. If you want a more exotic (but slower) breakfast, cross Sixth Avenue to the Sofitel, which also has a great bar. But T-45 is fine and open now until Midnight. The Sky Lounge bar is nice if you make it up there. A little bit awe inspiring at 50 stories up to be open air, but you'll adjust. My only pet peeve is that I always have to provide my Hyatt frequent flyer number, despite having stayed many times. So I wish there was better tracking of return customers in the computers here.

Service was good at the reception, even so the welcome was a bit robotic in the night, overall however good. They seems to shut down elevators over night as we needed to wait for a bit when coming home late. Room was super small, like almost all middle class hotel rooms in NYC, the bathroom shower area however a waste of space, fits easily 3 pax at once! Missed that space around the bed or entree. Keep windows closed as its noisy due to some renovations next door and street excavation. Great views also from lower floors. No restaurant - only a outsourced Starbucks kind of coffee place not open 24/7. If not too high in expectation and just need a bed - go for it! Otherwise pay less and stay in Novotel or similar.

The bathroom was lovely with bath and shower options. The amenities were all you could ask for but if anything else was needed you could request off a list.The bed was beyond comfy. Very hard to get out of, even with all of NYC to explore.Very little noise from the corridor although i think the fact that there aren't many rooms on the floor really help it stay quiet.Maids were great and whenever ever we passed them in the morning they were very polite and friendly. Reception staff although we didnt have much to do with them, did seem pleasent.

Prior to arrival, we outlined our needs to the hotel staff (by twitter feed, emails, and actual phone calls). This hotel replied with a promise of adequate accommodations for a family of 4. Although we were upgraded to a corner suite on the top floor, the accommodations did not fit our needs as we travel as a family of 4, two adults and two children. This was the only problem we encountered: the cramped accommodations and the children did not have comfortable night sleep as they only gave us one rollaway bed and removed a round table from the tiny living area. To hotel staff's credit, however, we were shown two other types of rooms and given a choice to move. We declined both as the first was a two queen beds in one room on the 44th floor facing other high-rises to its north that lacked privacy and the wow-factor. It was a room that you can find at any typical Holiday Inn type of property. The second room we were shown was an executive suite with ample space but it was on the 5th floor with plenty street noise and adjacent buildings' HVAC humming noise that gets magnified during the night.Great location right at Time Square in the Theater District with walking distance to 42nd Street subway station placing the entire city at your fingertips. The room at the 53rd floor in this fashionable high-rise hotel offered amazing unobstructed views of the city. Our room was facing south and thus we could see the newly built One World Trade Center from both rooms. As it was a corner suite, to our west we could see the Chrysler Building. Our room was well appointed with comfortable bed and adequate water pressure in the bathroom. Minor issues with housekeeping but overall, the service was great from the staff at T45 Restaurant (especially Ms. Lisa) to the front desk manager, Mr. Aris, who kept a vigil on our room situation and he also made sure we get transportation to the airport on time. Upon check-in, for our anniversary, we were also given a welcome gift that consisted of brownies, fruits, and wine. This was a very nice gesture of a property that knows how to treat its Hyatt loyalty program members. The food at T45 was a pleasant surprise offering a number of options including Omelets, traditional fare such as eggs in a variety of choices, Pancakes, etc. During our 4-nights stay, we tried something new every morning and it was a pleasure to our palates. The service was prompt, courteous and friendly.Concierge staff was helpful on the most part and had some good recommendations, such as Tony Di Napoli Italian Restaurant. They also provided accurate directions to many points of interest in the city. Another plus for this hotel is the rooftop bar (BAR 54) which is facing south with expansive views of the city that stretch across Manhattan from the Hudson River to the East River.This hotel would have earned 5-stars in this review if the accommodations for the kids was adequate. Recommended especially for couples or the single traveler.","Santa Ana, California",230,4.0

The following morning we happened to pop back to the hotel about half 10 and noticed the sign that said there was a tour of the rooftop bar and considering I am only 19 I wasn't aloud up there to have a drink in the evening (obviously) so we sat down and a lovely lady called Lauren who I cannot thank enough for everything she did for us, took us up and took photos and showed us round and answered any questions etc. We then saw her a few times afterwards and as I was not very well she fetched me some throat sweets to help me feel better and to let her know if there's anything we needed, if we needed directions or advice she'd be brilliant and it's just so nice to have someone who will go above and beyond. She's wonderful!

The room was so quiet, I couldn't believe it. Bed was fabulous, bathroom had no bath which is common in New York hotels but it did have an amazing rain-shower. The staff in the lobby are so nice and greet you every time you go out and return. I didn't eat breakfast here as I like to go out and go to a proper New York diner when I'm here. The best place for breakfast is The Brooklyn Diner, which is nearby (actually if you google it you'll see there are 2 or 3 branches) The absolute best thing is the bar though: Bar 54.It's the highest bar in New York with views to die for, both indoor and out! Lovely at night when it's all lit up. A word of warning though! The bar is on the high side price wise, but I suppose you are paying a premium for the view and the table service. They really know their cocktails here, so get something you've always wanted to try, don't go for your usual cosmo, any monkey can make one of those and you can get one anywhere!

However massive selection within a 15 min radius be it walk or subway, my suggestion is to get out and eat in some of the other neighbourhoods like lower east side, tribeca etc rather then settle for tourist time squareBreakfast I would suggest walking East on 45th and going to one of the delis or cafes for a morning takeaway breakfast or for a good sit down the French place un, deux, touis (spelt wrong sorry!) in w44th.Went to the bar - here the only let down, seated next to a grossly intoxicated person, throwing things in the floor etc. in NZ the bar would be up for a loss of license. The staff seemed to oddly tolerate this behaviour... Drinks also very pricey, maybe a visit for the view and a drink, certainly wouldn't want to have a few here.For a drink the Irish pubs close by are great - cheap and friendly, wouldn't choose to eat here but great for a few cheap drinks before and after dinner.Hotel has pc and printer that can be used, 15 min free and 5 pages per day.

Had put it off for years.Booked the Hyatt Times Square. It was a lovely hotel, and the staff were great, but if you go to New York expecting or wanting anything other than a box to sleep in you'll be very disappointed (or have an empty wallet)! I saw a lovely triple glazed boutique hotel 100 yards away with triple glazing to keep the road noise to a minimum, for 1/3 of the cost. If I ever go back, I now know. No offence Hyatt, as other than the waiting time for elevators, it was a really nice place to stay with great staff, and a truly pleasant experience!Saw everything we wanted to see, including Broadway shows, and having done it, probably would not go back other than to see NY in the summer rather than the winter. Xmas is special in NY and they do it really well, so highly recommended. The World Trade Memorial is peaceful and tasteful, and well worth a visit to pay respects and appreciate the scale and impact, which is very sobering.We used the tube service throughout, and walked for miles. The New Yorkers we came across were absolutely excellent, offering unsolicited help whenever we managed to look like stranded tourists, and really responsive when we managed to sneak up on them and not be seen as newbies to NY. It's clear that they live in a manic city that never sleeps, but the ones we met had time to help and chat.None of the iconic sights and locations disappointed! We had a great time, nice digs, and would really recommend NY as you can only truly appreciate the scale of things when you're in the middle of it looking at the landscape from the One World Tower or the Empire State building.","Liverpool, United Kingdom",16,4.0

The Hyatt is very conveniently located in the heart of Times Square and there are a couple of restaurants right by the Hyatt. We enjoyed getting coffee and bagels every morning at the Starbucks located directly across the street from the hotel. The hotel was very clean and modern and the room we had on the 44th floor had a ceiling to floor window that overlooked NYC - simply gorgeous and worth the extra money we paid for the view. I loved the roof top bar but found their prices rather high. The view from their though was phenomenal and we did take some gorgeous pictures up there. The prices for the drinks up there were pretty high, and the restaurant on the ground floor was more like a cafe' and very small. There were major issues with the elevators while we were there and out of three elevators, only one was working the majority of the time. At one point all of them were broken and we had to take the service elevator up to our rooms. I prayed every day that the darn things would keep working and not break while we were in them. We are going to go back to NYC this October, but I don't think we will be staying at the Hyatt.","Fleming Island, Florida",4,4.0

We also made friends with Melissa (exec admin at Hatt) and her lovely family who showed us around and treated us to breakfast New Years day which was very kind of them. This hotel is in a great location, just off the corner of 45th St and Broadway, enough to be away from the noise of Times Square but still in the thick of it all. The rooms are soundproof and relatively large on New York standards. We had a corner room overlooking Times Square, just missing the view of the ball drop (we had room 3303). If you are looking at going to New York for New Years, you can get a great view of the Ball Drop at the hotels rooftop bar (buy your tickets early and they are not cheap - but nothing is in New York..also children are not allowed, which was a shame but is law in NY we believe). It is very difficult to get out in the square on New Years unless you head out there very early (by 1200) which is difficult with little kids and the cold.

For those familiar with Hyatt's Gold Passport guest program, I was a Hyatt Platinum not a Diamond at the time, so didn't have a Hyatt upgrade certificate or otherwise try to upgrade. But I had a decent travel budget that allowed me to book a suite, though not a corner suite.My impressions:Service: Excellent. Friendly and efficient front desk, and equally responsive and competent folks when I called the customer service line (or whatever it's called) at the hotel. Location: This is where I think one's perspective on the hotel can depend a lot on who you are and why you're in NYC. As a native New Yorker who's been back to NYC lots of times for work and play, I'm not a big fan of the crowded Times Square area. (I picked the hotel to begin with because I wanted to get some Hyatt points out of it and because I was in a rush when making the booking.) But it could be great for tourists who want to be in the heart of things.View: This is another respect in which the jaded New Yorker in me might see things differently from a tourist. I wasn't wowed by the view I had looking toward Times Square from a fairly high floor (sorry, can't recall, but maybe half-way up the hotel?). And after seeing it, I turned down the top floor room (not a suite, though at about the same price) facing north, which the front desk helpfully offered me instead of my booked suite when I first checked in and asked for a very high floor. In both instances, I was mainly looking out a just some other tall buildings nearby, rather than some great NYC vistas I'd gotten from some other hotels in the city. But again, I want to emphasize that for folks who are visiting NYC as tourists or for the first time, the views might well be fine.Room: Nothing fancy, but fine. And very quiet, which I really valued. Heated bathroom floor, which was a nice feature. Both bedroom and living room were decent-sized. Elevators: I didn't have any problems with the waits or crowds others have reported in a few posts. But I wasn't on a very regular schedule. I can see how waits/crowds could be a problem certain times of day. Restaurants nearby: For what it's worth, even in the touristy Timed Square area not known for great dining options, a few friends and I chanced on a very good, modernish, Italian/Mediterranean place a block or two away. It's called Etcetera Etcetera.Bottom line: Probably not my first choice for my next business visit to NYC and certainly not if I visit there on vacation with my wife and want to spend some points or $$ on a nice place. But, as explained, this is due to my own perspective and preferences, including how I feel about Times Square. I nevertheless liked the hotel and would certainly recommend it for tourists or for business guests working right nearby. And I'd even consider go back on business if the price were sufficiently low compared to other options.","Oakland, CA",282,4.0

The front desk staff was of mixed friendliness--while some were friendly and helpful, others were, at best, indifferent, and, at worst, clearly bothered to have to even answer a question. The organization was somewhat nonexistent, and there seemed to always be a large, disorganized ""line"" (more like a crowd) at the desk. It was never clear where one was supposed to be. Very confusing and awkward, especially as this area of the lobby was very small for the crowd and the many comings and goings. Even just a corded off area with a clear line/order would have been helpful. To have finally made it to the desk only to be greeted (sometimes) by impatience made it all seem much worse than it actually was. The only other complaints are that the elevators were on the slow side and the room carpet was perhaps not the newest.These relatively minor issues aside, we couldn't have been more pleased with the Hyatt Times Square. It is in a perfect location right in the center of everything you could possibly want, and the doorman was quick to help us out of or into a cab. The room was enormous by NYC standards, with very comfortable beds and a lovely view. There was even free in-room coffee--amazing here. The bathroom was also large, with both a tub and a separate step-in shower, and the sink area easily accommodated two people at the mirror. A small window opened so we could listen to the traffic sounds below, but other than the noise we chose, there simply wasn't a sound. Bliss! The fitness center was very good sized, better than some full gyms we've been in, with a wide variety of good quality machines and weight equipment so we never waited for a machine to use, plus plenty to read, televisions and music, and clean towels. The rooftop lounge was excellent, with truly awesome views (even the one night it absolutely poured rain) and surprisingly good appetizer-type food--the salmon skewers were about as tasty as it gets--and the salty snack mix was always welcome. The only food we had in the downstairs restaurant was a morning muffin, but it was fresh.All in all, a very good stay at a very good place.

We where there with our 18yr old daughter so had a x 2 bedroom high floor. No additional chair in the room and no real room to move about in, so very disappointed with the room and bathroom size. House keeping was inconsistent. Trash not moved on some days. The lifts we always had to queue for but as it was a busy period this is understandable. We had a major problem with a very rude member of the roof top bar : I believe her name to be Debbie. On arrival to the bar, no staff were on hand to assist us, so following a brief moment on the outside terrace to take a couple of pictures, we noted a table had just been vacated. We sat on the table to be set upon by a very rude, unprofessional member of staff, who spoke to us in an appalling manner, telling us "" you can't sit there, move from the table you have too book and there is a queue so move now. Disgraceful attitude. Then sashayed off, only to be then overheard telling other colleagues about the incident at the bar in earshot of myself and family. We did complain, and we where offered a glass of complimentary apple cider in which all guests have as a complimentary perk. A few days later we relieved A voicemail from a member of the hotel team apologising for the incident and it had been dealt with. Sadly for us this tarnished our stay.

My wife and I couldn't get one for the first night as they were fully booked however we managed to change rooms (27th floor) the following day with the help of the exceptional front desk agent Jeff, for an extra $100 a night it was well worth it.Other exceptional members of staff include Kimberley and Spencer who could not do enough to ensure our stay was pleasurable,Don't bother trying to book a show through the concierge there is a large premium on the face value of the tickets and you are located so close to the shows it is very easy to walk up to the box office at 10:00am on the day of the show and purchase tickets for that night - often for a discount on the normal price.The roof top bar B54 offers exceptional views however, for 3 of our nights the bar had been booked out for corporate Christmas parties and therefore we were unable to use it.Being so central (W45th and 7th Ave) you are literally 150yds from Times square and within easy walking distance of Macy's/Empire State Building to the South on 34th street Radio City Music Hall/Rockerfella Centre to the North on 51st street, The USS Intrepid museum to the West on 12th Avenue and the Met Life Building and Grand Central Terminal on Park Avenue to the East. Even Central Park is only a 5 minute walk away.Traffic is an issue during the rush hour so if you are planning to travel by car/taxi do it before 8:00am or wait until after 10:00am and before 4:00pm and after 7:00pm.","London, United Kingdom",11,4.0

I arrived at the hotel in a taxi, tired after a long flight and was greeted by a friendly doorman who grabbed my luggage and started chatting with me straight away. Check-in was a really lovely experience, once I'd told the hosts it was my first time to America and New York City they couldn't have been more welcoming, offering to help me find my way around and make recommendations on where to go. Our room was outstanding, on a high floor we had impressive views of the city. The room itself has been furnished to an incredibly high standard, very trendy, modern and almost executive whilst still feeling homely. There is a Nespresso machine in the room and if you leave a note for your housekeeper and a good tip they'll keep you stocked up with plenty of coffee throughout your stay (Branded Starbucks).The bed was massive and the bathroom was a very good size with a rainfall-style shower. A list was left in our room in case there was anything we needed, some free of charge, some required a small deposit. We were really glad of this when we realised our hair straighteners didn't seem to be working and the hotel brought us some to use free of charge for the rest of the week. Our housekeeper (Shoutout to Francis) was fantastic, always leaving our room in immaculate condition! Another person we need to mention personally is Customer Host, Spencer. He made our stay extra special by always being ready to help us with anything. The only negative we experienced at the hotel was that I had arranged for a birthday surprise later on in the week for my sister of wine and cake to be delivered to the room, unfortunately due to miscommunication with the kitchen it was brought up on our first night. Spencer dealt with us personally, apologising and arranging for the cost to be taken off the bill. The 'Sky Lounge' is really the highlight of this hotel, currently the tallest hotel rooftop bar in New York City it has impressive views across the whole city when it is lit up at night and is a great suntrap in the middle of the day. Be mindful though that here you will pay more for convenience of it being exclusive for guests. We paid $65 for one pitcher of cocktail and that was minus tax and tip but it's worth going up there if even only for one night during your stay just for the views. The staff in the bar were lovely and even gave us some free drinks on my sister's birthday which was really kind. The location of this hotel is absolutely superb! Across the street from Starbucks and Planet Hollywood and less than a 2 minute walk to the heart of Times Square where you will find an array of shops, restaurants and entertainment. The nearest subway is at Times Square and this is a great starting point to get you around - We got the subway from here to get to the Mets Stadium. There is also a Walmart for all your essential needs. The hotel really is right in the heart of everything and is in a location which you can easily get to places slightly further afield. Radio City Music Hall and Empire State Building was about a 15 minute walk from the hotel, Central Park was about a 20 minute walk. We got an Uber taxi from the hotel to Downtown Manhattan when visiting the One World Trade Centre and the 9/11 Memorial and it cost us approx $45. The hotel offers free-wifi throughout which is really useful. If you have time, make sure you book in advance to eat Breakfast/Brunch at Sarabeths near Central Park (only 20 minutes away) for an unforgettable meal! This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and for my first visit to America and NYC made it an unforgettable one, especially as the price wasn't anywhere near as extortionate as some of the other hotels nearby. You really get what you pay for here and more and the staff are a real highlight, absolutely superb stay! Will definitely return if I'm ever back in New York City!","Cardiff, United Kingdom",74,5.0

We booked a deluxe Queen room for 4 people and had plenty of space, which is saying something for a NYC hotel room. Beds were comfortable, shower/ bathroom was very nice with a large bathtub and decent water pressure.

We finally agreed on the Hyatt, Time Square due to location and price point. What my fiancé did not know at that time was that I intend to use this opportunity to propose to her so I wanted everything to be perfect.I reached out to the hotels staff a few days prior to our trip to explain what I was hoping to do and how they could help with making this experience happen the way I envisioned it in my mind. I did request a room on a high floor with spectacular views and that the staff not say a word to my girlfriend and potentially ruin the surprise so I was not sure what to expect once we arrived. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Steve the doorman, whom at the time I had no idea was going to play such a pivotal role in making my proposal go off without a hitch. The manager on duty was waiting for us and had already arranged to put us on the second highest floor with the most unbelievable view of the city skyline and Time Square and as promised the staff did not say one single word to tip off my girlfriend so the plan was in motion.When we arrived to the room we were taken back by the views which automatically took our attention away from all the great things the room we were staying in had to offer. We quickly noticed the amazing bathroom that comes with the Deluxe Suite, View. The rain shower head and heated floors were amazing to use during stay. I actually miss that bathroom now that I am thinking about it. The bathroom was very large and quite honestly may be the second largest room in that suite. We did not take advantage of the soaking tub but if you are someone who loves taking baths the tub they have in that bathroom will make it difficult for you to leave when it's time to check out. We had a king size bed in a perfectly sized bedroom that allowed us room to move around without stepping on each others toes. The view from the bedroom was as spectacular as the view from the main living space (upon entry to the suite) which seemed to the smaller of the three rooms but nonetheless functional. I'm told for New York standards we had a large hotel suite (coming from Chicago I couldn't complain which to me speaks volumes about the sq. ft. of the room) which most definitely satisfied my standards.After getting settled in I ran downstairs to catch the concierge before they left for the day to find out how far Central Park was from the hotel if we walked. During my conversation with the concierge he mentioned I should speak to Steve the doorman about getting a ride there so I can make it in time for my proposal. After sharing my plans with Steve he told me ""not to worry"" and to be downstairs at 8:30 A.M. I figured he was going to get us a cab or shuttle but Steve did WAY MORE than that and set us up with a personal driver (Latest fully loaded Suburban model) who picked us up promptly @ 8:30 A.M. from the hotel and drove us to Central Park. The driver was awesome and pointed out places we may want to see during our stay as he drove us to Central Park. Steve was running point on this so all I had to do was communicate with him via texted message.After I successfully proposed in Central Park (she said ""YES"" by the way...) and we took photos with a professional photographer I was able to texted Steve and the same driver located us on a busy Friday late morning in less than 15 minutes and took us back to the hotel where everyone (including Steve and our driver) was waiting to congratulate us. To cap things off the manager had a celebratory bottle of champagne with two glasses and a beautiful note awaiting us in the room upon our arrival. Unexpected but truly appreciated by my fiancé and I. What a kind gesture from the staff at the Hyatt, Time Square.I am so thankful that the staff went above and beyond to be so helpful whether it was inquiries about recommending a great place to eat Italian or how to navigate through the subways they were accessible and willing to help in all ways possible. We were able to see so much during our stay due to close proximity to tourist destinations, restaurants, shopping and means of transportation (e.g., subway). I most definitely will stay at the Hyatt, Time Square the next time we are in Manhattan, New York and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel to anyone looking to visit Manhattan, New York.","Villa Park, Illinois",4,5.0

I paid for this and this was what I expected. On check in at around 1300-1400 I was told the room was not ready yet but they would put us in an equivalent if not better room. This was a lie. I was put in a View King room on the 31st floor which was a smaller and cheaper room. I did not realise this at the time and as our stay was only short we did not want to waste time moving rooms. I was most disappointed that we had been downgraded but been told that it was supposed to be a better room.I tried to contact the hotel to arrange surprises for my partners birthday. This was ignored. Do not try to get in touch with the hotel via timessquare@hyatt.com because they just won't answer.The staff by the lift were most unfriendly when asking for proof that we were guests at the hotel.

The hotel and room were excellent. Everything is very contemporary. We had one of the ""view-two queens"" rooms. Hard to call it a ""view"" since it was not facing Times Square, so that was probably the biggest disappointment and why I'm not giving five stars. We were on the 30th floor, but facing north, so all we saw were other high rises around us - certainly nothing of note or interesting. I thought the room was fine - it seemed big by NYC standards compared to a couple other times I've been there - and plenty of room for three of us. The bathroom had a tub and shower. The hotel staff were very courteous and attentive, and one minor problem with our room was fixed almost immediately. Our room rate included free Wi-Fi.Two slight downsides, neither of which would keep us from staying here again. The restaurant, like many in NYC hotels, or most big city hotels for that matter, is grossly overpriced. Breakfast would have run at least $25 each for basic bacon, eggs, and juice. Lunch and dinner significantly more. Three diet cokes in 8oz bottles while we were waiting for airport transportation was almost $15. Fortunately, there are tons of less expensive restaurant options close-by. There is a deli just up the street, and an excellent Irish pub just a couple doors down - bacon and egg breakfast about $8, and a massive traditional Irish breakfast for $13.There is a very nice rooftop bar on the 54th floor. The view is fabulous and shouldn't be missed. However, you should pass on the $25 and up ""mixologist"" cocktails. I'm just not paying that much for a couple ounces of booze and fruit juice, and again, there are too many options in the area to pay that much.So - great hotel, great location, great staff, enjoyed our stay.

We also initially missed the refrigerator, safe, and coffee maker -- all disguised behind doors of the main chest in the room. Our initial impression was wrong.

I dislike the location, particularly the maddening crowds of Times Square.The Hyatt T.S. was the third Hyatt property I stayed in during a recent swing through the US and Canada. It was also the best of the three.I booked and got a room at a lower floor (8th) overlooking 45th. (Had hoped to upgrade but availability on the day I checked-in was shot.) The room was a bit smaller in size (28 sqm) than my room at the Hyatt Regency Vancouver (30+ sqm) but was way nicer and more distinctive. I liked the shelf above the bed with the glued (or bolted?) -on orange dog figurine and the ""T"" picture frame. I liked the TV baseboard with its numerous NYC snapshots. I liked the room numbers, with their analog alarm clock vibe (flipping numbers, like an old style departure board at an airport). I even liked the view from my room, watching people 8 floors below going about their business can be soothing (or at least a good way to gauge the outside temperature and what to wear).I liked that the room wasn't all design over function. The king sized bed was comfortable, lighting was bright, desk space was good, the TV an up-to-date LCD with HD channels (selection was limited though, no HBO, for example), drawer and closet space ample, and Wifi speed okay. As with other Hyatt's at this level, there was a paucity of stationery and only an empty mini-fridge. Amenities wise, I liked that I got free bottled water daily. I also liked that housekeeping was thorough.I liked the bathroom as well. It was smaller than the one at my room at Olive 8 but it was nice nonetheless. The bath's done in dark gray tile and had a stand-alone shower. Water pressure was strong, the heater worked, and the towels were good (not spectacular). I did not have a heated floor though (at least not that I could tell).I ate at the on-site restaurant for breakfast once and, while it was good; for my money, I'd go to the Brooklyn Diner a block away. What I didn't like - the location. I've been to New York City often enough to have a love hate relationship with T.S. I'll concede that the crass commercialization is spectacular and the area offers great transit access but T.S. is a place you want to visit, then get the hell out of. It certainly isn't a place you'd want to stay in. Indeed, there are nicer, far more tranquil and ""authentic"" areas in NYC,-- SoHo and LES come to mind -- that host nice (way nicer) hotels.Still, when all is said and done, the Hyatt T.S. was fine, as was my stay. It wasn't spectacular but I wasn't expecting spectacular anyway.",Manila,156,3.0

Having previously stayed in another hotel in the Times Square area on our last trip to NYC in 2013 we were intending to go back but were won over to the Hyatt by the positive reviews and reasonable price.The Positives: The hotel is in a fantastic location for those looking to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Times Square and major attractions such as The Rock, Empire State Building and Central Park are all within easy walking distance. The room we stayed in on the 11th floor was ultra modern with contemporary decor and a lovely shower. The view from the bar on the 54th floor (of which more later) is great but comes at a price and some of the key highlights of the NY skyline such as the Empire State Building are not visible as hidden behind the H&M TowerThe disappointments: We arrived on my birthday (Halloween) and had already seen on their website that the hotel was holding a fancy dress competition in the rooftop bar so came prepared with an outfit intending to celebrate. We found the party to be a somewhat subdued affair so left after a short time and had more fun out on the streets watching the processions of trick or treaters. Despite supplying my room number and asking to be notified I still don't know who won the fancy dress. We had also intended to spend our last night with a farewell cocktail on the 54th floor. Having arrived to find the inside busy we indicated to the host that we were happy to sit outside but were told this would not be possible due to weather conditions. As New York was enjoying an unseasonable warm spell there were already a number of people sat outside so we queried this and were told that as the temprature was below 65 degrees drinks could not be served by staff outside but that when our drink was brought to us we could take it outside if we chose. We opted to wait to be served inside only to see a tray of drinks being carried outside by a waitress at which point we left and enjoyed a far more relaxed (not to mention less costly) evening at the Heartland Brewery a few blocks away. If you want great views save the money you would have spent on a round of drinks here and use it to take a trip to the One World Observatory in World Trade Centre One. You will still have sufficient change for a cup of coffee whilst enjoying far more spectacular views.Several times in our visit staff failed to replenish coffee or water and we had to ask the front desk for more and on our last day the room had still not been made up by 6:00pm with the room maid arriving just as we were preparing to go out for an evening meal. In fairness all issues were quickly rectified but I would have expect more attention to detail in a hotel of this class.When checking out we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay and did mention several of the issues again but this was brushed aside with little by way of apology.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",15,3.0

In the middle of the theater district, the location of the hotel is perfect if you're around for a short stay. Upon stepping out you're immediately surrounded by the buzz of the city and Central Park, Herald Square, 5th Ave shopping is all a short walk away. - Hotel has a modern look/feel. The rooms are just as advertised in the pictures: spacious, clean, modern, with awesome views. Having a room with floor to ceiling windows was one of the best things about the stay, the view is something one could never get tired off. The bathroom was large and well equipped with a great rain shower and toiletries. A hair dryer is provided and the hotel also has a list of items you can borrow if you need for no extra cost. We requested a hair flat iron and it was brought to our room within 10 minutes. - There is a rooftop bar on the 54th floor with some breathtaking views of the city, we dropped by late one night and it wasn't even that crowded considering it was chilly.- Housekeeping was top notch, rooms were made up early in the day and were immaculately clean. They leave you new bottles of water everyday as well.- There is a charging dock in the room with various outlets for overseas travelers. - Elevators are very fast and our wait time was pretty much non-existent even though the hotel was busy and we were on the 30th floor. - Noise was not an issue despite being in the heart of Times Square. - Wi-fi was easy to hook up to & fast.- The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant and remembered us by name every time we returned to the hotel. Umbrellas were available to borrow which was convenient as it poured like crazy one of the days during our stay. Bell hop was really enthusiastic and helpful with moving/watching our luggage upon check out. The Bad Stuff: - This isn't specific to the hotel really, but traffic in the area can be terrible and moves slower than a snail. If you're a walker this isn't an issue at all, but short distances aren't worth cabbing it in this location.- With regards to the hotel, absolutely nothing to complain about !

Perfect to get to all the sights and attractions via foot with Empire State and Top to the Rock only 10-15 minute walk.From the minute we arrived at the hotel we experienced nothing but fantastic customer service which started with a speedy checkin. We had a room with a view on the 39th floor with 2 x queen beds. Standard of the room was far in excess of what we expected, the room with clean, modern and very spacious. Water was provided daily and once housekeeping realised that there were 3 occupants she provided 3 bottles of water per day.The hotel restaurant on the ground floor nice but expensive for breakfast and that welcome beer at the end of a hard days sight seeing and shopping.The only slight downside is that the hotel has an amazing rooftop bar and restaurant but having a young son meant that we could not take advantage of this great facility. However, the we were allowed to take our son onto the terrace to take pictures of the view.The staff were also cheery and nothing was too much bother: from helping us book excursions to Woodbury Common,to sorting out postcards back to the UK, though to finally printing boarding passes and getting a taxi organised for that journey back home.No hassle,no issues all made for a memorable stayWhen we return to the Big apple we will definitely book to stay here again and would also consider Hyatt hotels for other holiday locations based upon this experience","Windsor, United Kingdom",8,5.0

After booking I started to do some research on New York and never having been before was a bit worried by the number of people advising against staying in / near Times Square. On arrival booking in was quick, staff were lovely and we were quickly in our room on the 22nd floor. The room was a double queen which was spacious with very comfortable beds and floor to ceiling Windows. The room had a mini fridge with complimentary water, a coffee machine, safe, ironing board and iron. There was also plenty of hanging space and room to store bags without tripping over them. In addition there was a multi media centre on the desk, great for charging phones & I pads etc. The bathroom was also spacious, however was a bit short on shower gel. Also in the room is a card with a list of other items that can be supplied to the room. Room service was a little sporadic, ie we had been out all day and arrived back to find that the room had not been cleaned, a quick visit to reception and this was soon remedied. I believe there had been problems with the lifts that day which may have had some bearing in this. We visited the rooftop bar which has stunning views, but is a touch expensive 14$ for a glass of Prosecco. I didn't try any but cocktails appeared to be about 26$. Although children aren't allowed in there the staff were happy for our son to pop up between 4-7pm to look at the views / take photos. Now, to Times Square, if you want to be in ""the thick of it"" then I don't think you can go wrong with this hotel, although not directly on the square it is a welcome 2 minute walk away, you still get brief views from your room. However being on the 22nd floor we did get a bit of noise, but not enough to keep us awake. I am led to believe that this isn't an issue the higher up you go.

On arrival the front desk staff tried to downgrade me to a lower category room than I booked with no rate adjustment (booked direct). Only after my refusal was I actually give an upgrade. I guess the place was booked solid for the room category I booked. Would be far better to start off with an upgrade offer than try to low ball somebody. Upon entering the room first impression was overall very nice. However after settling in I came across some room defects. I couldn’t turn off the lights in the bedroom and had to unscrew them to sleep (I could have called but couldn't be bothered, after all I was just upgraded). Air conditioning blew directly onto the bed.Showered in the morning and shower handle came off in my hand. Went to leave the room and waited for the room to self close. It did but I didn’t hear the click of the lock. When I went back to check, the room was not closed. If I hadn’t checked the room would have been accessible by anyone (note if you stay here). After a full day out I came back and somehow I had missed house keeping. Room was as I left it, No big deal I was alone and had more towels. Again I had just been upgraded so don’t complain. Next day again a full day out and came back around 18:00 to have again somehow missed house keeping. Privacy sign was not on. OKKK, so I went to front desk and asked for a couple of new towels as I wanted to shower before my flight the next day. I also informed I would be leaving the room now and heading to dinner. My expectations were that at the least the towels would be placed and a quick straighten up of the room done. Nope…I returned to the room to find two towels on the table. All the trash from my two days shopping still there, all the dirty towels still there and no attempt to straighten the room up. A bit disappointed I went to bed as I had a 5 am flight. Then at 9:30pm just as I was watching TV before sleep there was a knock at the door “ House Keeping”….. . I laughed and turned them away. After this I thought you’ll never remember all this so write it down so you can add it to the stay questionnaire all these hotels give you online. I went to write them down and the pen didn’t work. So no doubt there was more as I do remember leaving thinking the place is a nice hotel but the actual full experience of staying at Hyatt Times Square is not great. All these things are not huge but they are compounding to give a negative experience in some areas. On the Staff they are very good both in the Hotel and F&B.Lastly as mentioned I would normally only add my comments to an online questionnaire sent via the hotel so they are aware of defects. However I have decided to write this review as when I did fill out the review online I was contacted by Joshua, Assistant Front Office Manager, from the Hyatt Times Square who apologised for the short fallings and offered me to contact him directly. I have now emailed Joshua twice with no reply. Please be aware the hotel does not really care about your stay or repeat business.So all up hardware very good, Staff excellent, maintenance poor, house keeping can’t comment as I didn’t get to experience them. Trustworthiness to offer room booked and follow up on issues faced non existent.",Male,6,3.0

I like to unpack my suitcase when I get to hotels, hanging up clothes and putting in drawers. On the day we were leaving, we were in such a rush to get to the airport and i completely forgot about clothes in a drawer. I left them there and didn't notice until I got home the next day (our flight was cancelled and we were sent out on the next morning flight). I immediately called the hotel to tell them about it, knowing my room would have been cleaned and they would have found it by now. The lady told me to fill out a report on the ileftmystuff website, the system they file everything through. Fine. Went through the process and waited for a call, expecting I would get one the next day. I did not. I called back the next day wanting to speak with someone who could help with my situation, the girl on the phone said she would put me through to head of the maid service. Got no answer. So i hung up and called the girl back and explained what had happened and that it was just a couple days ago so it shouldn't of went far. She proceeded to tell me she didn't know and then transferred me again. No answer. I called back again she picked up the phone and hung up. I called back several more times and no answer. Obviously the clothes would have been picked up by the maids but instead of reporting it, they kept it! Which by the ignored and rude experience with the girl, can see she knows about it. I can't believe she hung up on me and ignored my calls!! It was the rudest thing I've ever experienced with a hotel!!! It was 5 pieces of new clothes I had.. $400 dollars or more!! I'm so upset, why would they keep my clothes?? I would even pay to get them sent back but clearly they kept them. Make sure to check the room top to bottom if you decide to stay here because nobody will be helping you out. Also the maids didn't clean our room one day.. said we had too much left out.

It was very nice having the choice to walk over to 6th Avenue if we wanted to avoid all the tourists and street performers.The welcome we received from Spencer at the front desk on our arrival was warm and friendly. He informed us of the amenities on offer and ensured that our rooms were upgraded as requested.The rooms are modern, spacious, and quiet (especially important given the constant din of Midtown Manhattan). The layouts vary a bit from room to room, but the product is solid. Housekeeping seems to run a very tight ship at this hotel.We dined at the T-45 restaurant most mornings and once for dinner. The food was very well prepared and portions were quite reasonably sized for an American eatery. Service ranged from warm and friendly to aloof and cool, depending on who was working the section.We also enjoyed a few cocktails at the rooftop bar, Bar 54, which is on the 54th floor of the hotel. The views are amazing, and the cocktails are handcrafted. Even the bar nibbles were very tasty.The door staff were also very helpful and friendly, hailing cabs as needed and quickly assisting with baggage.The only downsides for this property were 1) the small lobby, which had very limited seating options if you were waiting for a friend or fellow guest, and 2) the limited number of elevators serving each block of floors. For floors, 2 to 25 (about 250 rooms), there were two elevators, which led to long wait times for both up and down directions.Given all that, we would definitely consider the Hyatt Times Square for future travel to New York.","Langley, Canada",37,4.0

Our view was mainly to the south, with Times Square off to the side, but after having been down there, we did not need to spend all night gazing down from the 43rd floor.This is probably not a high service hotel (we did not even try for room service), but a good place to stay, due to location and quality. If you are a first-timer to NYC, plan on getting back to your room late afternoon to sit down, grab a drink, and rest up for dinner.","Peoria, Illinois",20,4.0

I was shocked to find, in my room on the 53rd floor, the window opened! (Only a few inches.) The room was elegant appointed, a bit small --typical for NYC hotel rooms--but had everything I needed, including a large bathroom with a beautiful soaking tub.The room service was so good I spent almost $900.00 in five days on food. Not a joke. They have a takeout kind of service, not the usual rolling cart they stick in your room, but it works wonderfully. It was probably the best room service food I've had in a hotel. The location is perfect for walking to major sight-seeing venues, and it's surprisingly quiet in the rooms. The wi-fi worked perfectly, I had an amazing view of the Manhattan skyline, the bedding and linens were excellent and comfortable; I had to drag myself from the room to go to my business meetings!If you stay here (or even if you don't), DO NOT miss the rooftop bar. It's a bit small, but it has an indoor and an outdoor area so if you suffer from vertigo you can still stay inside and enjoy the city views. Cocktails are pricey - my whiskey was $45.00 a glass, and a martini starts at $25.00 - but who cares when you're in such a magnificent location?From the moment I walked in the door, I felt welcome. The front desk staff are super efficient and friendly, the doormen literally jump to help you with your bags or get a taxi....this place is just great. Also I thought it was an excellent value compared to somewhere like the Ritz, because this hotel is just as lovely and has everything you might need.One last tip: If you're considering staying across the street at the Marriott Marquis, DON'T DO IT!

It is only a few years old and still in nice shape with clean modern furnished rooms and very generous sized rooms for New York. I like this hotel and it's short walking distance to Times Square, NBC, theater district, restaurant row, Chrysler bldg, and the subway. I do not like the 65.00 per nigh valet parking with no in and out privileges so I park around the corner at Icon parking on 46th and use ""parking whiz"" to book it at a discount. I saved 55.00 by doing this for 4 nights. When you arrive at the hotel by car just park in the valet parking area until you get you luggage into the hotel then got 1/2 block to the garage on 46th. The Valet's will yell at you to move your car but who in New York is not yelling, so just ignore them until you are checked in and then go park the car. One other tip is that the Hyatt seems to have adopted the European custom of not using a top sheet on the bed and just using a duvet and who know how often these get washed so ask for a top sheet be brought to your room when you check in. The beds are what they call in the hospitality business ""a sleep experience"" and they are just that and really comfortable. Closest best place to eat really good gourmet food without breaking the bank is Trattoria Trecolori 254 west 47th.

Not cheap ($20 for a couple of drinks) but the views of Times Square and the Chrysler building while relaxing after a long day are sensational. Tip: the terrace isn't the biggest so make a reservation. If it's full though, they will take your room number and ring you when a place outside becomes free which is pretty cool.

They were in awe! Of course, they suggested the electricity bill might be pretty big in Times Square. ;-) Hotel is really clean and quite modern. We had reserved a Deluxe King Suite but ended up in a King Deluxe -- the hotel managers cleared this up for us and compensated us back as all the rooms were sold out. We were okay with that seeing that the view from the room was that spectacular -- and may I say, the 53rd floor! (So high your ears popped going up and down). One floor beneath the highest rooftop bar in all of Times Square! The bathroom is clean and modern, rain shower (optional handheld + a bathtub) .. pretty large bathroom. No microwave, but it did have a small fridge tucked inside a cabinet. The small fridge could barely fit a take out tray..but it did hold our water bottles and small things. Because its a king Deluxe, it was more like a studio - one room, with a small desk and a chair and ottoman. It was fine for a family of 4 (w/ add'l rollaway bed), for only 2 nights. If longer, I would have demanded the suite (LR + separate BR) since that it what we reserved. My personal favorite part of the hotel? THE GYM! As I walked in, the heavens opened and the light came through! I walked in at 0530 and I owned the place. Not another anxious exercise enthusiast around. Dumbbells, weighted bard, lifescape treadmills (the kind that have a tv screen and you can ""pretend"" you're running in Germany or New Zealand. Plenty of cardio machines and weight machines, all size kettle balls, towels rolled up and ready for the next sweaty person at each machine. I was impressed and quite happy for 2 hours.

Right in the center of everything and within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, museums and Penn Station.

Bathroom was nice with a tile floor and rain shower. The beds and pillows are very comfortable and the room is surprisingly spacious in comparison to many other hotels that I've stayed at in the city. I also have to mention the rooftop bar--on the 54th floor. It is absolutely breathtaking! Too bad the drinks are very overpriced, but they can get away with it because of the beautiful atmosphere. One of the best parts of our stay. The cons: The thermostat in our room was either broken, or kept being reset at designated times each day. I stayed during a week where there was 90-100 degree weather outside with intense humidity so I wanted to come back to a cool room, but it often stayed in the 70s (went up to 78 one day!) even after manually setting it at 65 (the lowest it lets you set it). We called the front desk the first night and after about 90 minutes without anyone coming to our room, we called again. They finally sent someone up to our room and he changed the filter but it still didn't seem to do much.They also messed up my bill upon check out and it took several calls to accounting and the hotel manager to finally get it fixed. The walls are thin so it can be very noisy for people traveling on business. I could hear other rowdy guests and people watching tv in rooms that were adjacent to mine.

Despite how close we were to the hustle and bustle we found the room very quiet. I liked the fact it was not a huge hotel, easy to get in and out of. Concierge was great, arranging tickets for a show to be delivered to the hotel, giving advice and issuing tickets for the Empire State Building etc. The room was spacious with two wardrobes, full ironing board, iron, safe, fridge and coffee machine. Bottled water was provided every day. The bathroom was lovely with a big shower with overhead shower and a standard shower head on the wall, lots of toiletries, hair drier and a heated floor option. No shortage of towels either.We only ate once in the hotel in the ground floor restaurant for breakfast. Again very modern and clean and great service but a bit pricey eg. Smoked salmon bagel $21 which we later found at $10 in the nearby Cafe Manhattan.I did use the spa for nail work and everyone was helpful and friendly.Free wifi as spot on.Had we been a couple who could enjoy the rooftop bar I would rate this higher.","Redditch, United Kingdom",46,4.0

We weere driving and had a bit of a hard time looking for the hotel since it was not clearly visible from both the times square side and the opposite side. We had to ask an Nypd officer for help. As soon as we found it, there was a valet area to park. The valet, chester was very kind. Unloaded all our baggae and assisted us to the front desk. Check in took less than 5 minutes. I was a bit disaapointed because I had booked an executuve suite thinking it was on the higher floors with a great view so my 4 year old will enjoy the views of times square. That wasnt the case and all suites were on the lower floors. We wereon the 7th floor. The room was very clean and had an ok view of the side street. There was a king size bed and a seperate living area. The room was big enough to hold 5 people comfortably. As far as the walk to time square, it was less than 3 minutes. The hotel is at the heart of the times square, very close to toys r us and within walking distance to many places. The views on gbe rooftop is outstanding. They even allowed my to bring my son up despite it being a bar. The staff was friendly and helpful. They do have a parking garage but it cost $65 a day and you get charged everytime you pull out the vehicle. This I fell is very excessive. I hope management re evaluates this since I was a guest, paid for parking, I should be able to get the vehicle without being chraged. There is no shuttle to the airport, so a cab or your own rental may be necessary if traveling with family with lots of baggages.","Guam, Mariana Islands",13,5.0

Firstly the positives, great location in the heart of everything, excellent free Wi Fi, lovely clean spacious rooms with coffee making amenities etc and friendly staff from the cleaning crew to the concierge. However - I booked a view room in April and emailed the hotel asking for the highest floor possible in line with my booking as this was my girlfriends birthday so wanted it to be special but on check in was given the 28th floor - 28 floor of a 53/54 floor hotel is barely past mid way!!! I am aware that everyone will want a higher floor but as I booked months ago I was disappointed that I wasn't given a better floor. The view from my room was disappointing and as this was the main reason for booking this particular hotel (along with its location) I wasn't impressed. Secondly, I ordered room service once - I was aware that there was a 18% gratuity attached for the delivery to the room but once my food arrived I was told that that was a 'delivery charge' and it did not include a tip to the 'waiter' so by the time I had tipped the waiter I had spent $55 on 2 very average burgers and chips!!! Was not impressed. It's a shame but the great location failed to make up for a very poor room allocation upon check in. Unless you are getting a room with a view I would look for a cheaper alternative as there are plenty of hotels in the Times Square area that may not offer a view but are cheaper.

I did inform the hotel several times it was our anniversary but they failed to do anything over abs beyond not even a message to congratulate us!The only reason I could not give it for five stars is it really lacks on customer service side in a few areas. The check in concierge are nice but the door staff very unhelpful. My wife being visibly pregnant and having suitcase and the main door being very heavy the door men just stand and stare while you struggle! Really made me wonder what the point of them was apart from asking for your card to go up!  The bar staff downstairs were great and the drinks fairly priced.One of the things I did notice were the lack of shower gels, milk, tea, cotton buds etc and strangely these need to be order most of which are free! I couldn't work out if this was a cost cutting exercise or a environmentally friendly gesture to reduce on waste! Still undecided but was shocked at there being no mini bar at all and milk to the room was $4.There is a handy Starbucks and cafe/convenience store not to far however.Time square is a minutes walk or less which is what really counts. It's very very busy but if you want the touristy feel then it's the place to be.

We could see Times Square out the floor to ceiling windows in both rooms from our 42nd floor. The rooms were very up to date and very clean.

We would absolutely choose the Hyatt Times Square again.Location - great location. Sure Times Square is a bit crazy but 45th between 6th and 7th Avenues is a prime location close to everything. You are short walking distance to Central Park, Empire State Building, Rockafeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Hell's Kitchen... just everything. Rooms - Clean, good size, modern and sound proof! The most important thing in a city like New York is whether or not your room is sound proof, at the Hyatt Times Square they are. Having said that, you do need to have your fan on high to muffle the garbage trucks in the very early morning... but if your fan is on high you won't hear anything. Great Rain shower and good water pressure. Comfortable bed and bedding. Cordless phones, all good in the room. Other plus, our A/C fan did not face the bed so you didn't feel the fan blowing in your face all night long. Roof top bar - amazing views from the rooftop bar, great drinks and comfy seating. This place is absolutely worth you checking it out. Just make sure you don't arrive hungry, the food menu is small and only finger foods. Restaurant - although it is small, you can choose to sit outside which is great for people watching in NYC and all outdoor seating is shaded in the morning. The menu and the food are great with lots of choices. Staff - very friendly and professional staff everywhere in the hotel. Although their front desk is small, we were checked in very fast. Never had a problem having a quick word with the consierge, no long lines. We've stayed at a few different hotels around town and in terms of value for your money we thought the Hyatt Times Square was excellent in comparison to other hotels of the same caliber. Extra tips - Bond 45, the restaurant right across the street also has a great breakfast menu. Plus their lunch and dinner are also very good.

There was no view to speak of. My main concern was that although new, the carpet was an odd choice - dated and green as were the curtains which were a bit temperamental. The bathroom was the main disappointment - very few/measly amenity products and the shower was a walk in - but large and felt a bit old/bare with browns cement like tiles - similar to a disabled public shower, or like an outdoor camping shower.The air conditioning was excellent. The room service whilst quite tasty and a good size portion, was delivered in cardboard, plastic boxes and a paper bag. For this calibre hotel I think a plate and trolley would be more appropriate, along with better for the environment. Also, room service finishes at 11pm so no late night snacking!The Sky lounge was pretty cool - great service - great views.I like this product and this hotel, I would stay here again.

While the hotel front is on 45th St - it's location was close enough to feel like you were right there - and probably made the stay alot quieter. We were in a corner two queen bed room on the 19th floor - and we were very pleased with room size, the bed, the mini-refrigerator, rain shower, and cleanliness. This places lives up to being a Hyatt. For being in the city and given we weren't THAT high up, we thought the room was relatively quiet. Didn't hear hallway noises - just standard traffic background noise.Check-in and valet parking went smoothly - no issues. Parking is high - $65 per night without in and out privileges - but we checked some local garages while there and that valet rate only seemed to be a few dollars more than other close by places - so we felt the convenience of having parking through the hotel made up for those few dollars. Front desk had a subway map to hand out. We didn't use any of the hotel features - didn't dine there or use the gym or spa - so can't comment on those.

I wanted to prepare my kids for the disappointment most of the hotels are there. But everything I told them was simply not true at the Hyatt Times Square! The room was a double queen and bigger than a normal hotel room in most cities I have visited. The bathroom had a nice sized shower and a large soaking tub with plenty of counter space for 4 adults. Everything was spotless. The queen beds were actually almost queen size and we could share without anyone being squashed. There were no bed bugs, no bad smells and nothing broken. My only complaint about the room was there was no hangers in the closet. The staff was amazing! Anything they could do for us they would. They would bring you complimentary bottles of water, pillows, extra towels just by asking. The hotel was in a great location, steps from Time Square and many good restaurants. And the view was simply amazing. While the price wasn't cheap at $450 a night, it certainly wasn't the most expensive, more of an average in New York City. You just can't beat the location. We could walk to so many places, Rockefeller Center, Radio Music Hall, Circle Line pier and that saved hundreds in cab fare. Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.

I won't go in to detail on what gloria did for us but she ensured that everything ran smoothly for my wife and her 6 bridesmaids on the day. On arrival we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite which was nothing short of sensational. We were in room 5101 and the views were fantastic. The spacious room was complimented by a wet room style bathroom and wifi was free throughout the hotel which is a rarity in new york. On the day of the wedding we were supplied with a bottle of prosecco and a couples massage at the Marilyn Monroe spa on the day of our departure. Our wedding reception was on the spirit of new york and we had to get across manhattan in rush our traffic. If Aaron from the front door hadn't arranged suv's for us we would have never had found enough taxi's to get bus to Chelsea pier on time. Over all this is one of the best hotels we have stayed in.

We checked in early at around noon-ish and received our key cards to a north-facing room on floor 24 if I remember correctly. I was very impressed with the room since it was very clean and somewhat stylish. The bathroom is large and modern with a really large mirror. Its location is pretty hard to beat since you are right next to Times Square although it could be quite tiring to walk pass through the crowd every time from 42nd st. up to the hotel. I found the noise from the street to be minimal and had a restful night. In terms of facilities, we went up to the rooftop bar and were kindly allowed to take a look at the view briefly without having to buy a drink (it was raining before that so the outdoor area was wet and unoccupied though). The fitness facilities are well maintained with plenty of fresh towel available. We didn't have the chance to look at the spa though.

My reviews are with an eye for understanding about where I am in the world and that there are a world of differences. Arriving at Grand Central Station, it was only a 10 minute walk to the hotel. Very convenient considering we were dragging suitcases. We were greeted warmly by the valet who held the door for us to enter. A little crowded checking in but not bad. We told the front desk person that we were Hyatt Gold Card members and that we appreciated that we were receiving 20% off our meal at the hotel as stated on their webpage. She said that we were mistaken and that there was no such promotion. In a condescending manner she told us she would look into this later, but we knew she was just brushing us off. We were quickly given our room key and sent on our way. A room valet was not offered but I'm sure if we wanted one there would have been someone to help. The room was perfect. Loved the spaciousness of the bedroom, the view, and the offer to provide us with any essentials that we might want delivered to our room. The bathroom was not very big, but it was fine. It really bothered me that the front desk clerk didn't help us, so after settling in I looked up the hotel's webpage and there was the information about the 20% off! My husband immediately went down to the lobby with my phone in hand to show them. This was mostly to demonstrate that we weren't trying to dupe them, because at this point we didn't think they were going to do anything. The Manager got involved and really was surprised to find out what we were telling them was 100% accurate! They were unaware of this promotion. They should have investigated immediately, because why would anyone make this stuff up? Anyway, we highly recommend their restaurant, but that's for another review. Make sure to check out their rooftop bar, it's so lovely and the view is amazing. The wait staff are wonderful and the bartender is fantastic. Drinks are $25 a piece, so bring your wallet!

The first positive item is its location, right at Times Square, we had a view of Times Square from our room, I highly recommend upgrading to a view room for this reason. Just a few steps from the entrance are many stores and restaurants. You are right in the middle of just about anything you could want, most all of the broadway shows are within an easy walk as well. If you are going to take a bus tour, Times Square is the primary location they start from, both the hop on and off tours as well as the others.If you stay here or not and are close to Times Square you really should check out the rooftop bar here. I was told it was the highest one in the city. The views are great and the drinks are as well. The service could be a little more friendly but that is most likely because I am comparing it to Texas hospitality.

When we inquired about how to get 4 people and lots of luggage to the airport, the suggestion was to stand out and wait for q large cab. Walter ended up scheduling the car we needed.

We had a Deluxe View King room(45th floor) with views of Times Square and absolutely loved it. Our room faced south and on a clear day you could see all the way to Freedom Tower! When it was time to go to bed, the curtains/drapes were more than adequate to block out the lights of the city that never sleeps. As with any hotel in the city, parking is at a premium and expensive. We used the hotels valet, which didn't allow in and out service, so once we parked our car, we didn't use it again for the 3 days we were there. But, with some research into the city's transit system you can get around fairly easily using that as an alternative. And let me say that we found the subway to be a lot better that it's reputation and would use it more the next time we go.

This hotel did not disappoint in any of these things. We went to the rooftop bar on the first night and the atmosphere was good and the view amazing. Unfortunately we got told off for moving seats though, as being English, we are used to being able to move seats in a bar (obviously not so in a restaurant) so we were unaware of the protocol. For this reason we didn't go back there and spent most of our evenings in O'Connellys next door which had a rooftop bar too, although not as elegant but a lot friendlier. We didn't use the Hyatt restaurant downstairs but it did look cool too and if we had had more time then we definitely would have tried it. The location was great with everything just a short walk away. We had room 2905 and it was so quiet (unless you open the window) with good sound proofing. The spa only had a steam room and treatments so I think it would benefit from a Jacuzzi, to ease our aching feet at the end of a long days sightseeing.

But we still enjoyed it a lot. The pros: 1. Very convenient location for tourists. It's almost right off Times Square, but on a relatively smaller street. Our family of 4, including a 5 year old walked all the way to Central Park and United Nations (something like 10 blocks). Rockefeller Center is only a few blocks away. Buses to downtown and all major subway stations are no more than a couple blocks.2. Relatively quiet, compared to the hustle and bustle of Times Square at least, esp. if you stay on a high floor. I didn't hear any noise from next door either. 3. Generally clean. 4. Very friendly front desk. Always smiling and helpful. Offered early check-in and late check-out. 5. Complimentary wi-fi (pleasantly surprised)6. Double queen rooms are quite spacious, given how precious space is in this location. I don't think the Grand Hyatt nearby has two queens. For a family of 4 this is a great setup. Cons: 1. As I said earlier, the decor leaves a lot to be desired for this level of hotel. 2. The carpet and restroom tiles are already showing quite a bit of wear and tear, despite this being a relatively new hotel. 3. Parking is obviously expensive, at $65/24 hrs. So we parked at Edison FastPark one block away. Overall I think this is a winner for tourists like us, if you have Gold Passport points to redeem. The regular rate can be quite high.","Clarksville, Maryland",20,4.0

The bed was quite comfortable, but the sheets and comforter looked worn. On the whole, the visual impression is of a hotel that needs serious cosmetic upgrades. By contrast, the Hilton on 42nd Street, which is a competing hotel, just shows much better and feels cleaner. The on site restaurant, T54, is nice and they brought up room service food promptly.

Pier 79 is the nearest stop for Water Taxis heading towards Statue of Liberty and One World Trade. The rooms are very spacious, well looked after and provide ample wardrobe area for clothes. However, hangers are in short supply and despite giving the impression multiple drawers were available, only 3 existed. The remainder, especially bedside are ""filled in"". The bathrooms provide both shower and bath facilities, there are multiple towels and are kept in excellent condition. The cleaners do a very thorough job!The Sky Lounge, located on the 54th floor provides an excellent rooftop view of the panoramic NYC Skyline at night. Numerous cocktails are served, as well as the usual beer and wine options. If you're under 30 just ensure you take your ID along as you will be asked at the entrance and possibly by the server.Restaurant T45 provides a reasonable breakfast selection and is also open for dinner although we did not try this option. However, the service is mediocre as staff can forget orders, take ages to clear plates and on one occasion no maple syrup was provided with pancakes despite requests to 3 separate individuals!!Overall, our stay in New York was very enjoyable and in general the Hyatt certainly enhanced the experience.","London, United Kingdom",26,4.0

The rooms are small, which is usually the case in NYC, but they are setup well, and the bathrooms are a good size. The staff is very attentive and polite, and it's one of the reasons I choose to return to this hotel. . The hotel is extremely well situate, on 45th street just off of Times Square between 6th avenue and 7th avenue, so you have immediate access to the Broadway theatres in the area or to shopping nearby, A walk north to Central park or south to Macy's is only about 30 min in either case. I have seen the hotel rate vary depending on the season, but it tends to be more affordable for the value than many other hotels nearby. Valet parking is constantly expensive, but par for the area. I find the widely varying rate, as well as the inconsistent policies and prices relate to valet pricing and WiFi access fees, a bit annoying. This hotel has a roof top bar, and the view and the bar scene itself is very nice. You can also sit outside weather permitting. It is expensive, so not for everyday, but fun for a peak at the city skyline.","Montreal, Canada",35,4.0

There is nothing negative to say, but it still wasn't quite what I had expected. First the good: the rooms are adequately-sized, somewhat spacious for NYC. The decor is fun, kind of danish-modern. The staff is responsive and helpful. BUT, the lobby is more consistent with a Hyatt Place or Hampton Inn then what I expect from flying the Hyatt flag. Similarly, the hallways to the rooms are now and space-efficient like you would expect from a Hyatt Place instead of a Hyatt. While the staff was friendly, having to repeatedly show my room key for elevator access (to the same people) got tiresome. for my purposes, it could have been closer to the Subway (wasn't too far, but walking through Times Square gets tiresome). Great location for almost all Theatres. For lobby, room size and convenience, Hilton Times Square will remain my property of choice.

The housekeeping manager and the evening front desk manager for Saturday night need to learn a bit of customer service skills. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

We stayed in a handicap accessible room cause it was what was available for early check in, which was fine and appreciated, only downside to that was the shower was a roll in without the step or barrier that kept the water from flooding onto the bathroom floor no matter how you try to avoid it. But bathroom was clean and spacious. The front desk staff was so so friendly, as was housekeeping. There was always a guy standing by the door which we thought was a doorman but never once did someone open the doors for us, despite being right there, and even with our luggage. ..and they check for room keys to get to the elevator but of 3 days only did thay once so I'm not sure the protocol for that. Also they charge 100 per night for incidentals which seemed like more than I ever have had. It was fine for us, but if someone was staying for a week it seems like a lot to hold.

The hotel is nicely set in the heart of NYC, 20 seconds walking distance from Times Square. Overall the hotel is brand new (they told me is only two years old) and features an amazing rooftop bar with views on the Crysler building and the Freedom Tower.First of all the room is lacking the basics. No toiletry, empty fridge, no slipperies, no laundry bag, no nothing. You need to ask for everything. I ended up calling three times the reception in the 10 minutes upon entering my room to have delivered what was missing as I discovered it. Very disappointing.On my second day they simply skipped housekeeping, so I was left with my room not done and I had to ask new towels. Nobody even bothered apologizing.Other disappointing chapter: room service. Food quality is horrible, I ordered a burger that was almost inedible. Shake Shack would be a smarter choice. But what amazed me is that for the price of the usual Hyatt room service (you know, rolling tray, metal spoons, ceramic plate, etc.) you are delivered your food in a paper bag where the food is stuffed in paper plates. Cutlery is made out of plastic.Again, no problem with this ""urban approach"", but at least they should downsize the price accordingly. Also, forget food at the ground floor diner. They only have unhealthy breakfast options and you are obliged to buy family size portions. I asked for a croissant and I received a basket with one croissant, one pain au chocolat and two muffins. Dinner food is the very same of room service: inedible (but here at least you eat it on proper ceramic plates).Finally, the day before departure I called front desk at 6pm to ask for a black car transport to JFK the morning after and they told me it was not possibile to book because ""the concierge has already left"". Unbelievable.So no, despite the great position and being new, I will never stay again in this establishment. It's crazy expensive for what it has to offer and overall it's a very unfriendly hotel for business travelers.","London, United Kingdom",120,2.0

The decor is, as we heard a little boy say, ""Swanky"". Very classy. The rooftop bar (Highest in NYC) provides you with a spectacular view while you have a beverage ( a bit pricey, but worth it for the view alone). The rooms are big for NYC (Just as big as any other city). Also, we were on the 25'th floor so it was quiet at night. Can't say enough about it.

We used the free wifi and enjoyed the complimentary bottles of water in our room. It was pouring outside and the hotel offered umbrellas to utilize while walking outdoors. My one complaint would be that the small round candies offered on the counter at check-in are not the best choice for kids. The size is perfect for a child to choke on (my son almost did so accidentally). Not a deal breaker for us but we'll steer clear of those candies next time.

When we checked back at 4, our room was ready complete with a great view (ask for a high floor), and was beautifully decorated, spotless and spacious (surprising for an NYC hotel). Only minor complaint -- like others have said, the roof top bar has a strict ""no kids allowed"" policy. Being a bar, I get it -- but why can't it be billed as a restaurant? They serve food AND drink... my kids and I would have loved an afternoon and/or a late night snack. But we weren't even allowed to sit down at a table.

Our room was clean, spacious and well stocked with water, Starbucks coffee and bathroom toiletries by housekeeping daily. The rooftop bar on the 54th floor also has amazing views although it is quite expensive $23 for cocktails and $22 for a can of Sixpoint Crisp beer (which is a little steep considering in the UK Sixpoint Crisp is around £2 / $1.33 in Wetherspoons) but we did know how expensive the drinks were before we visited and went for the experience and views not to save money! The only shock was the cost to phone the UK from the hotel. I made 2 calls from our hotel room back home to check on our dog, 6 minutes in total cost $70 so if you think you'll need to phone home it would definitely be worth looking into other options. The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring Manhattan, just off Times Square and walking distance to most of the tourist attractions.

We do this city trip every year (although we live in the city LOL!!) We decided to give the Hyatt at Time Square a try. The hotel is located just off of Time Square. Not too far but far enough to get away from the touristy crowd. The modern decor was pleasing to the eye. The staff was very polite. When we checked in a staff member took my son next door to the restaurant (T45) and they gave him brownies. Our 1 bedroom deluxe view suite was located on the 24th Fl Room 2401. The room was nicely decorated with floor to ceiling windows. The bedroom was spacious and cozy it had a 47 inch t.v. and 2 large closets. The living area ""lounge area"" was also spacious, furnished with a 47 inch t.v., a work desk station, and a small refrigerator. There is also Starbucks coffee supplied with 2 bottles of water that the hotel provides free of charge. I opted for the real Starbucks across the street and my son opted to take the bottled waters. The bathroom was a bit dark with the black tiles and it was equipped with a stand up shower with both a “rainforest” shower head and one you could hold. The shower pressure was excellent. There was also a separate tub, located to the left of the shower, that we did not use at all. The only issue we had with the room was the fact that it was not soundproof as the hotel advertised. Even 24 floors up we could still hear the city's car horns and and occasional sirens from a passing ambulance or police car. It was not that bad but noticeable enough to raise the volume on the t.v. at night. The room was also located near the elevators. It we could hear the noise from the elevators going up and down. The hotel has some amenities that I was unable to venture out and experience such as the gym and the roof top bar. But the front desk did advise that I was allowed to bring my son up to the rooftop bar between 4-5 (not sure if that time frame is accurate) and we can take a look at the view from there. I opted to pass this up and took my son to the Top of the Rock instead. Overall our stay was pleasant. My son is already planning his return trip next year. He prefers this hotel over the W Hotel in Time Square that we stayed the previous year. I would agree with him but would opt for a room further away from the elevators.","New York City, New York",13,5.0

Our rooms on the 15th floor were opposite each other and although the views were okay obviously the higher up you are the views would be better. The rooms were large for New York standards and the beds too. The artwork was very contemporary and the rooms were styling. The shower and bathroom were clean and new and if something was not there you just called and they delivered it straight up to your room eg make up wipes, toothpaste, teabags, water etc. I was impressed how comfortable the beds were. The bar on the 54th floor is worth a visit to with spectacular views but perhaps a little pricey. Its not as big as some of the other hotels but we preferred this. The gym had all the equipment in it required although it was busy the one time I did go in there. The staff on the whole were helpful. The hotels big bonus is it is right behind Time Square and even though that was the case we were not affected by the noise or the bustle of it all. Everything is very close by. The lovely attendant Lois gets a special mention for arranging our transfers on the last day and being so helpful despite it being so cold.

The location is great, just steps away from Times Square. Rooms were decent sized, clean and modern. Now the reason for three stars:They charge $10+tax for handling your packages. And by handling I mean delivering your packages from their front desk or mail room to your room. What the heck? You can ship a small package across US by USPS for that price. As someone who is traveling every single week (IT consultant) I have to buy most of my stuff online and ship to my hotel. This was the first time a hotel charged me for handling my packages, I paid $54 for 5 packages. Seriously? What have you actually done to charge that? Took an elevator to bring a package to my room. No gas burned, it wouldn't take someone more than 2 minutes to do this. And the elevators... There are 2 serving floors up to 25 and 3 serving 26-54. And in the mornings and evenings you wait and wait and wait then get an elevator already full so you wait and wait again.

In researching hotel options, I saw that Hyatt had a new hotel that looked well-positioned for our admittedly-touristy interests on this trip, so we gave it a try.The property was new, the elevators were fast (2nd fastest in Manhattan, I believe), the walls and doors were thick (no noise), the room was very comfortable, and our favorite part was the bathroom's floor-to-ceiling window with a roll-down shade that made every part of the room open and airy.The service was impeccable. Everyone was fantastically polite and attentive throughout our 4 days on property (we were greeted at least 2-3 times whenever we entered or departed the hotel). There were good food options, and we enjoyed the room service as well as the quick dining option (coffee and pastries) downstairs. One night, I snuck up to the rooftop bar for a nightcap. The bar was smartly appointed, run by great bartenders, and had an excellent view from the uncrowded balcony. The location was ideal. As others have noted, the hotel is on a side street near Times Square, so it is a short walk to Times Square and only a slightly longer walk to our other interests (Broadway, the Carnegie Deli, etc.). Although further still, the location allowed us to comfortably walk up to Central Park and back down Fifth Avenue for shopping. Whenever we came back, it felt like a refuge from the hustle.When we decided to venture further out to see the Guggenheim Museum, Little Italy and the East Village, we discovered the hotel's one, small issue: The advantage of the location on a side street is a disadvantage when you need a cab. However, it wasn't always an issue (there are LOTS of cabs driving down 45th Street on their way to Times Square) and, to give you an idea of the dedication of the staff, at one time we had a doorman, concierge and manager all standing in the street trying to get us a cab. Whenever we couldn't readily get a cab there on 45th, we simply walked over to 6th Avenue.I have stayed at the Hyatt at 48th & Lexington (another great property) and various Hiltons in Manhattan.

This was after a full day of meetings and immediately before an important company dinner. What was most appalling was that despite repeated phone calls from a staff member, it took a full 25 minutes (from the time the reception clerk confirmed it was not my key card but rather the mechanism that was not functioning) for a maintenance/engineering person to come address the problem, which turned out to be a dead battery. My questions:1. Why employ a door mechanism that cannot be overridden by a master key, which all staff members have? What if there had been an emergency?2. Why cannot the staff check door batteries daily, as they (should) do the lights in the room, for example? 3. How could the responsiveness of maintenance/engineering team be improved? The above event took place at 5 pm on a weekday....I can only imagine the delay were this to take place late night on the weekend.While the reception clerk who helped me (Spencer) was helpful and extremely apologetic, I believe the situation above merits the attention of the GM (whose name I was able to extract from front desk only after repeated questioning) or other senior management.

Nice and clean like it should be. Bed was very comfortable.Checkin was great. I asked if a high floor was possible. Was told it was not possible as most guests have checked in earlier. I arrived at 7pm so this must be considered late. Though I was given $50 credit to use at the Bar on floor 54 as a token of not having a high floor.When checking in I asked if a late checkout was possible of 6pm as I had a flight at midnight to South America and wanted a place to have a rest before going to the airport. I was advised that 12pm could only be done and a charge of $50 plus taxes each hour after that. If I had of known this I would have booked another night as this option is a lot cheaper. A day us room was not offered at checkin.I checked out at 12pm and left my bags at the hotel for the afternoon. Before collecting my bags I had time to visit the bar on the 54th floor and had a drink. I mentioned I was given credit on the room which I had not used. The staff said they rang reception and was told they were not able to locate the credit I told them about and suggested I pay for the drink and go check with reception myself.I collected my bags and then was going to see reception but saw my ride to the airport had arrived so I was not able to sort this out at reception.I did enjoy my stay and would stay again.

The room itself was very nice - large for New York, modern and large bathroom as well. Really smartly done. Coffee maker with complimentary mineral water was a nice touch. Gym on site as well and free wifi.The not so good things - the 'Hyatt has it concept' is great - room includes the basics and then there's a list of items you can order from housekeeping for free, e.g. shower gel (instead of soap and shampoo), kettle, vanity kit, foam pillows etc. The problem is the execution of delivering what you order - we ordered 4 things and it took 4 calls to get them all, each time we ordered we got the first thing requested but none of the others! Felt a bit sorry for the poor housekeeping guy who had to make 3 additional visits because the Guest Services person couldn't process the order properly! The other issue which really annoyed me - we asked Concierge to book us a restaurant for the evening as we were meeting up with some friends. He confirmed that it was all done, great we thought, until we got to the restaurant and they had no confirmation for us......they later discovered that concierge had booked us in to the restaurant 4 days later - luckily the restaurant were able to seat us after a 30 min wait but very embarrassing for us and annoying when we wanted an early dinner as we had our 9 month old daughter with us - we did complain to a different concierge gentleman on our return to the hotel so hopefully the person in question has now been taught how to use his fancy online booking system!So in summary, hotel location, rooms and features were superb, Guest Services and Concierge let it down on this occasion.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",204,4.0

Check was great Ravi got out daughter a chocolate bar and I asked if we could upgrade to a floor with a good view, a reasonable price to do so. We got a corner unit on the 30th floor that was great. 1 king bed, my daughter slept on the chair with ottoman which she liked. Ravi made sure we has lots of pillows for me as pregnant ladies need and a large feather duvet cover for my daughter. He also brought up some chocolates. He is really a great asset to Hyatt. Going in and out of hotel the valets always opened door. Walter was great. Staff in hotel and restaurant were great. Only complaint lies with no kids in rooftop bar- which I understand and the hotel restaurant. We were way to tired after American girl store, toys r us and Lego store to go out and eat. The prices are on par with Manhattan and hotels- the food portions are not. I had the onion soup which was overly sweet and the watercress salad that was so tiny maybe 3/4 cup of watercress and 2 small slivers of apples. My husband had carrot soup which was good and flat iron steak which was 3 maybe 4 oz tops that came with a grilled green onion for $30. If it weren't for the bread that came with soup we have gone up hungry. My daughter enjoyed her pasta. We live only across the river- we will be back for an adult weekend when I can drink.

The only thing I found really disappointing about our stay was that there were very clear notes in the booking stating the above (I'm a travel agent, I put them there myself) but neither of these events were ever mentioned - We weren't fishing for upgrades or anything but a ""Congratulations!"" would have been nice.We checked in late due to a flight delay and the staff member at the front desk (Brian) was very hospitable. He gave us some recommendations for restaurants that were still open as well as some advice on how to get well-priced Broadway tickets. He also spent a good amount of time figuring out which room to allocate to us with the best view which was nice.Our room was located on the 32nd floor on the corner of the building and had a great view of Times Square which we later found out is a blessing and a curse, especially for light sleepers. The curtains don't block out all of the light from the street below and combined with the noise of the loud heating I struggled to fall/stay asleep. Heavy sleepers wouldn't have an issue. This particular room was well appointed, more than spacious enough for the two of us and the bed was very comfortable. I had a slight issue with the bathroom as there is a great big beautiful shower with a tiny little shower head, making over half of the space wasted. There is a rainfall shower head but it's not entirely useful for women not wanting to drench their hair in every shower and still creates a huge wasted space.The elevators are an absolute nightmare when you are located somewhere towards the middle of the high rise. 3 out of 5 elevators are designated for rooms 25 and up however one of them remained on level ""C"" and wouldn't budge. We found ourselves playing a lot of games of Chicken and seeing who would crack and make a B-Line for the stairs. Often we would be waiting for 10 minutes + to get down to the lobby which was frustrating as we could hear both lifts going up and down without stopping. Going back up was worse on the weekend because of regular guests as well as the general public making their way to Bar 54.Location-wise there are few other properties comparable to the Hyatt. Literally steps away from the middle of times Square and Broadway it made the perfect base location for us as we wanted to see a lot of shows. Walking distance to other points of interest like Central Park and there are subway stations within a few short minutes as well.All things taken in to account the Hyatt is great in a lot of ways but there are a few kinks that need ironing out such as attention to the purpose of travel, the shower heads and the issue with the elevators. We'd definitely stay here again if the price was reasonable.","Melbourne, Australia",1,4.0

We had originally booked another hotel but had second thoughts at the last minute, and I'm so glad we decided to stay here! The location was fantastic!!! This was my first trip to New York, and I had initially thought I would prefer a hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. But as it turns out, I love the energy and excitement of that area! Our room was pretty high (we were in a deluxe view king), and we could hear some street noise, but certainly not enough to disturb our rest. The rooms are set up so that you really don't hear noise from the adjacent rooms (which to me, is often the most annoying thing about a hotel). The room was very nice - not huge, but plenty of room and the bathroom was pretty roomy. I thought the bed was very comfortable. I had read a couple of reviews prior to our trip where some people complained about there being only a fitted sheet and a comforter, but no top sheet on the bed. That was a little concerning to me because it seemed strange, but it turned out not to be a big deal at all. Women may want to consider taking a makeup mirror because I wasn't crazy about the lighting in the bathroom, but I may be more picky than most about that kind of thing. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful except for one conversation my husband had with a concierge concerning transportation in the city. He found her to be less than helpful. But for the most part, everyone was great! Like I said, the location is great! Just a few steps from the excitement of Times Square, but also close to Rockefeller Center and even the walk to Central Park wasn't bad.

She even coordinated with me to meet with my florist the evening before our ceremony, and took great care of our flowers before and after the wedding. The night before the big event we had a small, pre-wedding reception in the VIP area of the beautiful Bar 54 at the very top of the hotel. My guests were amazed by the view and the wonderful food-- I was amazed by the exceptional service. The staff went out of their way to cater to our every need. A great way for our families to mix and mingle.2.) The hotel General Manager delivered a hand written card congratulating us on our marriage, and later sent a gift of champagne and strawberries. So special.3.) Everyone on staff treated us like CELEBRITIES....and we had a small wedding group ! I have never had such wonderful customer service (and we are super picky)! Our families are very well traveled, and everyone remarked on the superior service and quality food (watch out for the bar punch...it sneaks up on you! LOL!)4.) I had a post- wedding breakfast at the hotel restaurant, T45 , which was consistent with the excellent service of the roof top lounge. The food was great, but most importantly-- they placed my wedding flowers (which had been graciously stored in the hotel coolers) ON THE BREAKFAST TABLES! So sweet and kind.5.) The hotel has wonderful, clean, modern rooms with the best views. All of my guests were wowed by how large the rooms were-- considering this was NYC. The housekeeping is immaculate.6.) Finally, and most importantly, we stayed well within our budget for a very upscale, lovely wedding weekend in New York.Every detail was covered by the Hyatt Times Square, and I cannot thank them enough.

It's always nice when front desk staff greet you nicely and make you feel welcome on to the property, it sets a nice tone to the rest of your stay. The room surpassed all expectations, great views, a king bed, an actual king bed and not just two beds pushed together, great amenities, massive tv, a multimedia station on the desk providing ports for devices and to connect your devices to watch through the tv. The bed was comfortable and the room was serviced to a very high standard. Beyond this, there were extra toiletries that the hotel provided free of charge if and when required. The location itself is brilliant. Close to Times Square but around the corner away from the glare of the lights so you don't have the lights reflecting into your room as you try to sleep, 3 mins away from Broadway theatres that stage the most popular shows like Book of Mormon, the lion king, Chicago etc. a 10 minute walk to Hell's Kitchen and best of all, really close to the 42nd and 49th street metros which will get you anywhere in Manhattan and beyond. I can't rate this hotel highly enough, check out the bar on the 54th floor as well. The staff were really helpful and awesome, at no point did it feel like we were burdening them. The only critique I would have is that the concierge always had a wait time when we tried to use the service, maybe have another concierge for the busier periods during the day.","Auckland Central, New Zealand",31,5.0

The location is fantastic and the staff really are good, for me this makes or breaks a hotel. The staff were genuinely warm and friendly on check in and regularly wished us a good evening or welcome back on leaving/returning to the hotel. We were on the 35th floor in a corner room with views of Times Square. Great view and although this isn't why we chose the hotel it was a really nice feature. We were in a standard King - the room was a very good size for the location and the look of the room and bathroom were great. The room did look a bit tired but this was mainly due to poor design - there were lots of softwood surfaces which had suffered lots of watermarks through use, likewise the bathroom could have benefited from some thought put in to the tile grouting which looked tired. There could also be more attention to cleaning - there were a couple of stray hairs and strangely half a green humbug on the bathroom floor which was really obvious so not sure how it was missed. Usually these things would turn me off a hotel and reduce the rating but everything else, staff especially, were excellent so I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay here again. I probably wouldn't recommend the bar though - not that many seats have good views and there are far better views and drinks around Times Square.","London, United Kingdom",22,5.0

Rooms are quiet. Bad: New hotel but broken handles marred experience in shower. No coffee maker in room. ( Starbucks across the street). The lobby is not provisional, it is non-existent. Ugly: Although some may appreciate smarmy front desk clerks. I do not. Making inferences and judgments about a guest from their ID is not cool. Not even if it is part of their ""well we try to make small talk"". As a frequent traveler, I noticed a similarity between this bewildering lack of finesse and tact as reminding me of a Boston Hyatt property that has done the same on multiple times. Turns out they have same GM. UGH. It goes beyond tact- some of the questions are basically ignorant and indicate a lack of observation. There is a reason talking about the weather is safe! Other hotels, more modest ones handle this basic facet of hospitality. coming in and out of the hotel, the chatter from the Banana Republic staff is interesting and questionable. The bedding was fine and the room was nice and quiet despite its proximity. Some recycling considered. Ample outlets. The bar upstairs is nice though seating is frustrating. All the seats had reserved signs on them early in the evening so the one is stuck with limited options. Host tried to do his best. Servers were kinda not with it. Must be the height. If you get this property or choose to stay here, you will notice that the room itself and the location are best. The people- not so much.

The room is large for Manhattan standards, and everything is nice and new and for the most part works (one electrical outlets in my room didn't work but the others did). The negatives - having to call the front desk to have things like shower gel and tea delivered seemed ridiculous for a Hyatt hotel. Not only that, but the card on the study desk in the room which tells you to just dial 0 for anything you need, also says ""we'll place the items in a bag on your doorknob"". This implied to me that housekeeping would just leave the items in the bag and not disturb me. But I ordered and heard the housekeeping knock - they knocked three times before then trying to enter the room. I assume the whole thing is a ploy to not only save money for the hotel, but earn additional tips as well. This is not what I'd expect from a 4 star NYC hotel. Not only that - but when you realise you forgot to order something, then you have to deal with the whole rigmarole again.The other negative is the room service - I was looking forward to a nice, good quality burger given that it's a Hyatt in the US. I was delivered a meal in a bag with plastic cutlery and a surly delivery man who could have come from the fast foot joint down the road. The meal was barely edible, and for almost $25 for one cold, mediocre burger I would have been better off going to McDonald's around the corner. In addition - the room service menu clearly states that 18% service charge is added to the bill - yet the slip I was given to sign stated ""suggested gratuities"" of 15-20% and the delivery man looked angry I didn't leave more. My opinion of the Hyatt has gone completely downhill and it's made my IGH/Hyatt Gold Passport dilemma easy. It's IHG from now on.","Vancouver, Canada",12,2.0

The property appears to be new and it is well preserved. Clean. Very big rooms for New York standards, we were a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) and there was plenty of room for everyone and for everyone luggage. Big bathroom. Helpful and friendly reception desk staff. FREE Internet and (surprisingly) very good speed connection, usually when a hotel offers free internet the speed is usually lagging at the best and unbearable in most cases. Not here, I could connect through VPN to my office and work as if I was at home or at the office itself. This is a big plus to this hotel. Another bright spot on this, there is no limit on connected devices (nowadays it is quite common to carry laptop, cellphone, iPad and hotels that impose a limit of devices connected are just annoying). I had a package delivered at the hotel and they did not charged me for it (which it also appears to be a new trend at some hotels)Great location, you are half block from Times Square which is great because you are very close but avoid the noise the fuzz of hotels that are located at Times Square. This hotel is indeed very quiet. Good restaurants nearby. If you are planning to go to a Broadway concert you are in the right place, it is a walking distance to all major theaters. It is also very close to lines Q, R, N, 1, 2, 3 (at Times Square - two blocks from the hotel) and 7 and 8 (at 6th Avenue - four blocks from the hotel) which is very convenient. Some cons: (i) the lobby is very small, there is no place for more than 7 or 8 people, this is not a big deal and it does no ruin the good experience at the hotel but it is a (small) issue when you need to wait for your flight and already checked out of your room; (ii) doorman service is bad, as it appears to be a New York hotel pattern (not my first time in New York that I get this ""doorman attitude""), but it is still annoying. What is the purpose of a doorman if they do not see to be willing to help you with your luggage on arrival and departure? I had a car booked and 20 minutes earlier I talked to the doorman to let me know if a driver arrives as I would be inside due to the cold, well, 5 minutes past the scheduled pick up time I venture outside just to found my driver there waiting for me and the very same doorman that I asked before there standing right in front of the car. Not to mentioned that I had 6 pieces of luggage and had to carry all of them to the car as the doorman did not seem to bother helping. Really this was my only complain about this otherwise excellent hotel.Great location, you are half block from Times Square which is great because you are very close but avoid the noise the fuzz of hotels that are located at Times Square.

We had 4-5 items online all the time, and there was no problem watching Netflix. The 42"" TV in the room, offers channels for kids and adults.The Movie rent in the room is like New York it self, expensive($13 a movie). I had breakfast only 1 time at the hotel, this was great. I don´t think this restaurant/cafe was run by the hotel, but you could charge you're meals on the room. The location of the hotel was perfect. 1 minute walk, and you´re in the middle of Times Square. Easy walk to everything and a safe place to go outside.Can´t complain on anything. The only thing I noticed sometimes, was the sirens on the fire/police/ambulance outside, but this I guess you have to live with in a big city. I will definitely recommend this hotel if you´re staying in New York.Oh!....don´t forget to check out the view from the bar on the 54´th floor. Excellent view. Kids are not allowed (21 years) but they are allowed to go out with an adult to see the view.Service? We had a problem with the toilet at 1:30am.

Well, the weather could have been nicer but I can’t blame the folks at The Hyatt for the cold & rain. The last visit I experienced, and wrote about on TripAdvisor, I ran into a couple staff members that were not very outgoing or welcoming. This trip was the complete opposite as I was greeted at the curb by a friendly, helpful Bellman. As I entered the building I was again greeted by staff and directed to the front desk. The female front desk agent who checked me in was very friendly and professional. She stamped my key card envelope with #POTF – She said, “Part Of The Family.”I upgraded this trip to a suite for the extra space as I had work to do during the stay. I have to stay, if you are able to, get an upgrade and relax. I was fortunate enough to get a corner room and the views were awesome. (Request 4901)Being on the 49th floor I was concerned about long waits for the elevators. At no time during the 4 days did I ever have a long wait. THE ROOMThe living room has a very comfortable couch, side chair and a work desk. Unlike other hotels in the city this room came with a ton of outlets for cellphones and other electronic devices. There is also a great view from the living room windows – windows that open too by the way. If for some reason you don’t like the view of NYC, just draw the drapes and the room can be blacked out. (Note: Do not pull the drapes, there is a string behind them to open or close them. I found that out the hard way.)A small refrigerator is also provided in all rooms and comes in very handy. The bathroom is large with an interesting enclosed bathtub /shower area. (see photos) As I said in my previous review the water pressure in the shower is awesome, especially while using the wand. The bedroom is also a good size with a comfortable Hyatt bed. You will also find plenty of outlets in the bedroom. There are two open outlets on either side of the bed for the guest to use. The telephone power cord goes under the desk to another outlet. There was plenty of closet and drawer space for your clothes and other items in the bedroom and even a hook on the wall for a jacket or two. There is decent wifi in the room and also in the lobby area of the hotel. THE RESTAURANT One night I grabbed a burger and fries from the hotel restaurant located in the lobby and took it back to the room. I was shocked by how good they were, the burger was full of flavor and fries were crispy just how I like them. I highly recommend you try a burger while you’re there. ROOFTOP BARI stopped in at the Rooftop Bar just to see what was going on up there and was glad I did. It has a very relaxed vibe, not loud and crazy. There are no velvet ropes and security guards posted at the elevators that can intimidate people. I am looking forward to my next visit with friends so we can go spend time up there and enjoy the view. HOUSEKEEPINGThe Housekeeping Staff is outstanding, friendly, accommodating and professional. I usually sleep in late, certainly past the time they would show up to make up the room. I will call when I leave the room for lunch and when I return the room has always been made up for me. While going for ice one day I overheard a housekeeper singing while making up a room close to the ice machine. She had a very good voice too!LOCATIONJust steps from the Times Square area and many Broadway shows. The hotel is also right next door to Connolly’s Irish Pub & Restaurant – great food & a Phenomenal staff. Check out the photos of the room, rooftop bar, gym and grounds. Then go ahead and book your own stay – ask for a corner room if possible and of course the higher up the better.Thanks to Zach, Brendan, Nico, Walter and the entire staff at The Hyatt Times Square for a great stay.","Elyria, Ohio",83,5.0

We've got a room with a view however, if you need a privacy this room is definitely not for you as the big windows give you a very open view to the buildings next door. We drawn the curtains every time we sleep at night and it's solved the problem. They have a rooftop bar however, due to a cold weather this January we didn't pay a visit but I'm sure it'll be nice during a warmer month. The concierge suggest us to take a tour bus (hop on - hop off) if you'd like to use your time wisely as the traffic could be congested in NYC. We choose one of the tour bus company which offers a tour of the uptown, downtown, Brooklyn loops, night tour and free cruise from one of a package for 2 days passes. Choose a cover top at double decker tour bus as it could be very cold during winter month especially when you're taking the night tour of a beautiful Manhattan. This 2 days passes are worth it as you can managed your time accordingly and you can see lots of historical landmarks of NYC. A visit to the 9/11 memorial is a must, and prepare lots of tissue in your pocket. There's irish bar next to the hotel and the food quite good, Starbucks just across the street if you need your morning coffee. But otherwise the cafe in the lobby level quite cosy. If you have to catch early morning flight there's usually a standby yellow cab or the hotel staff will offer to look one for you. Overall impression, it's a very good hotel in terms of location, facilities and value.","Madrid, Spain",17,4.0

The room was nice enough and the staff was helpful. Something was making a humming noise in our wall which disturbed my husband, but I'm not a light sleeper so it didn't really bother me much. The valet parking was very convenient. We were given free drink tickets because there was some confusion with our reservation (which was resolved) so we took the time to check out the roof top bar. It was December so we didn't have the opportunity to enjoy the outside portion which looked very nice, but the inside was nice too.

Located right smack in Times Square where we booked th room at the highest floor (53rd floor) overlooking the New Year's eve ball drop. This may not be the best view of the area but, the warm comfort of being in the bedroom and the view are p artly what you paid for. Perhaps like any new building built in major metropolis, the room si small compared to other hotels we've stayed here in the US and overseas. Interior is very contemporary and functional, comfortable bed; though should have spend more on better pillows, and a treat of numbers of TV channels. Internet connection was strong and free for the whole duration of our stay. We were also indulged with a good well-stocked Nespresso machine.The staff are very enthusiastic, friendly and helpful during our stay. We had a very nice experience from the staff; from the front desk, call center, concierge, restaurants to the housekeeping. Amenities are good but, what I find weird is that most of their toiletries and service items have to be requested. They have drawers that are empty of basic cutleries. Coffee cups have to be requested and you'd be provided with Starbucks paper coffee cups.Ordering room service from their menu feels like they've ordered from pack-and-go somewhere. It will be delivered to your room in a paperbag with all the plastic cutleries too, ofcourse. However, I was very impress how fast they are at bringing things you requested to your room both from room service and housekeeping.  I can say Hyatt had this hotel pretty close to Times Square where you can get everything you need and see most of the things you need to see in Manhattan close to it. So perhaps there's the assumption most services can be found outside and close that they can just leave it off. A plastic cup for New Year's celebration Champagne wouldn't do it, so I have to request for a proper glass. They brought us wine glass but, good enough. So, I guess you can request for things, though frankly I'd rather improvised than wait sometimes. (using the trash with a full plastic bag of ice a a champagne bucket)  However, I feel that since it's a 4 star hotel, go all the way instead of having some services feels like from a no-frill hotel. Overall, if just for New Year's eve celebration book room here (from 50th floor and corner rooms on 7th Avenue side) and if you're going on a broadway musical binging like what we did. Otherwise, find some other place to stay. ","Melbourne, Australia",18,3.0

Many of the rooms have heated bathroom floors -- really nice touch (figuratively and literally).Prices in lobby diner for breakfast are kinda high, but the prices for the drinks in the rooftop bar are insane.

It's in the perfect location for Rockefeller Center, Times Square (of course), and Fifth Avenue. We came Jan. 17th for a one night stay. As you first walk into the hotel, it's a very nice setup as the restaurant is on your left, elevators on your right, and straight ahead is front desk. Check in didn't take too long, and we received a room on the 38th floor with a nice view of Times Square. The room has a small fridge, bottle water, coffee, and that's pretty much it. The bathroom was very modern with a shower that almost reminded me of the showers from Fifth Avenue Andaz, but not as nice. Bed was solid but comfortable. It was a little chilly when we first walked in, but easily raised the temperature to fix that issue. We decided to check out Bar 54 which is open at 4pm. It is a really beautiful view. Right now, it's really too cold to stay out there, but I'm sure during the summer this will be the place to be. The huge downside the drinks are $25, I guess you are really paying for the view. The gym and spa look nice also, but we didn't have time either. The bar next door, O'Lunney's is not bad to be honest. They have good food and drinks so you can go there if you don't want to walk too far. There is also a Starbucks across the street too. The one annoying thing during our stay is that the two elevators broke so everyone on floors 25-54 was forced use to ONE elevator. You can say that we were waiting for a very very long time for the elevator to come. Other than that, it was a good stay.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",19,4.0

We chatted away as he checked us in and said that he had the option to upgrade us but before he did, we could have a look at both rooms. Great sales technique! We obviously went for the upgrade as the room gave us a view over TS and we'd be able to see the confetti and hear the music with our window open (if we were brave enough to open the window). Housekeeping was fabulous. I asked her to change the sheets on after the first night as I'm a believer of new year, clean everything. She was so lovely in understanding that. Ravi was exceptional the whole time we were there, explaining everything to us, generally chatting to us about where to go, what to do etc. Location of the hotel is perfect for those who have never been to NYC before and want to experience the whole magic of the city. I have been over 10 times over the past few years and this certainly was the most exceptional hotel experience I've ever had. Not only is Ravi fabulous and deserves a promotion, the rest of the staff were great too. The organisation of NYE and the wrist bands etc was flawless. Hyatt TS has to be one to look up to for the rest of the group. After the disgusting experience I had at the Hyatt Etoile, this stay reached beyond my experience, but then its to be expected with the prices!

There are 54 floors so if you are looking for a view, naturally you will be up higher and I didn't realize this and have a little bit of an elevator phobia since it goes very quickly (just to warn other guests with similar issues) and the elevator did tend to take quite awhile to reach us when we were trying to leave especially on Sunday/Monday, however going up from the Lobby was never an issue to wait very long. The Wi-Fi is not free, you will pay between $10 and $12 for it depending on the type of service you want (average or premium) and the television does not have as many channels as I expected, just about 20 or 25. I was disappointed to find we did not have a bath tub (we have a 2.5 year old) but the room itself is very modern. I find with modern looks, functionality tends to take a bit of a back seat and focus on looks first. The noise was minimal and it was great to have access to so many things near our home base.

We had a little walk in wardrobe which also contained an iron and ironing board. Also included in the room is a safe, a coffee maker (coffee etc included), a mini fridge (which you can stock yourself). Bottled water is complimentary each day. The lighting in the room can be controlled in 3 areas. It has a few different settings (all on/off, mood, reading,nightlight). Air conditioning was easy to use. Overall the room was very comfortable and relaxing and was cleaned daily. The bathroom was also great and had a rain shower as well as a hand held shower. Towels were changed every day. The location of the hotel is great, just a short walk to Times Square, right in the heart of all the activities and close to Broadway theatres. The restaurant downstairs off the lobby does great food. After checking out at 11am, the reception kept our bags for a few hours until our pick up arrived to bring us to the airport. We found all the staff (receptionists, cleaners, security, doormen and restaurant staff) to be most helpful and very friendly.

The hotel was offering a very attractive rate, it is in the heart of the theater district and I was with my wife and son who love the energy of Times Square, so I went for it.Even though this Hyatt is literally right around the corner from the heart of Times Square, it is removed just enough. You walk into a very small lobby to check in (the service was great) and then walk right around the corner to the elevators. This hotel is not about the lobby or common areas. There is a cafe attached to the lobby where you can get a bite to eat or stock up for your room. You walk outside, turn left, and there are multiple deli's to choose from as well as other restaurants left and right. It's an easy walk to Roc Center, 5th Avenue, Central Park and many of the pre-Christmas things we wanted to see and do.My wife and I visited the bar on the 54th floor, and it is amazing! It was cold, but to have that type of view oudoors with the woman I love and a drink in my hand was amazing. For some reason, management comped our bill, so I was about as pleased a a person could be. In any event, this is a very cool place.

Relaxed rather than stuffy.We are = couple of forty something's from UK with no kids looking to return to New York to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversaryour opinion = airport transfer handled over email and charged to the room (instead of asking for separate CC details which always annoys me) all went well ($170 I seem to recall from Newark Intl). Checkin one of the best I remember, very sincere and made me feel like I was getting a personal service, don't think I was upgraded necessarily but certainly walked away with smile and feeling special.Room = we had the ones withe separate small seating area and desk and have to say it was more comfortable/less austere than the pictures suggested - we had the east corner of the 44th floor which allowed a great view of the Chrysler building in the distance to our Left in the bedroom and a vertigo inducing view of Bubber Gumps/hard rock cafe and the""good morning America"" crowds from the seating area to our right. Very comfy bed and plenty of wardrobe space etc. furniture going for Nordic chic and managing to feel just about a bit better than IKEA. We spent a comfortable Sunday morning there before heading out to brunch and found it a good place to be. Starbucks coffee machine with enough for one cup each per day was nice.Bar/ public areas - the bar on the 54th floor was a disappointment in that it was trying to be a bit too cool and lacked the sincerity and warmth of the checkin experience - given it was one of our requirements we only actually went there once and found it more attractive to take the lift 44 floors down to the street rather than 10 floors up to the bar...- the ground floor cafe/dining room/ shop is where you pick up the beer/milk/provisions to fill your minibar ...apparently....again found the feel of the place a bit confused and never really sure why I would go in there other than to buy a bottle of water on the way in on a night .everything else seemed in good condition/ well maintained. Other than the check in guy, the friendliest people in the place were the maintenance guys and the cleaners/room attendants, always smiling and genuinely warm ....everyone else including concierge seemed a bit jaded and fed up having to work over the new year weekend ....didn't spoil anything just didn't encourage us to spend much time or cash there.Dining recommendations = you aren't going to starve in NYC, just buy the latest Zagats but our choices wereBreakfast = Brooklyn Diner just round the corner on 43rd street - expected a tourist trap but given we couldn't get in anywhere else gave it a go, really glad we did, busy Saturday morning but maitre'd was a superstar and the food and bloody Mary's/mimosas just greatBrunch = peacock Gallery at Waldorf Astoria, it ain't cheap but it is the full Americana buffet brunch experience we were looking for for a long and lazy couple of hours of excess.Dinner = ""Catch"", meat packing district, 9th Avenue opposite Ganservoort MP hotel - the cool Manhattan loft restaurant you've seen on TV but never managed to find, certainly in our experience, really good seafood/fish, Surrounded by the rich and the beautiful, just go with it and we found the staff soon stopped pouting and started giving great service.Bar = so many to choose from but probably best experience was the bar at the Peninsula hotel for all the reasons that made us take the lift down 44 floors back at our hotel.Experiences - Harlem globetrotters at Madison square garden was pretty cool, but anything in the ""Garden"" would be a good experience I think given its relatively intimate scaleEmpire State still a great couple of hours - we saw the queues and almost turned away but on speaking to the guy at the door found that for $50 each we would, get in the fast lane and boy was it worth it, took at least 3 hours of hanging around in queues out of it, well worth it!If you have read all of this then you are obviously keen - get your credit card out and get it booked ;-)..........and enjoy!","Yorkshire, England",50,4.0

Also there are no blankets - just a comforter which at first I thought was because it was a step toward saving water. This was not the case however since our towels got changed daily even though we left them hanging which is what I think is the signal to leave them as is.Fortunately the room has the thickest robes which when rolled up can be used as an additional pillow and when flattened out can be used as a blanket. It would have been better if additional pillows and blankets had been kept either in the closet or drawers if guests want them.

It is literally 1 minutes walk to the Times Square! As soon as you walk out of your hotel, turn right and walk down to the end of the street you will see red steps from the corner of the street! On the opposite end of the stree you can see the Empire State Building although It is about 10 streets away. A few streets down is Bryant park which has lovely little market type shops and ice skating. location is fantastic but at the same time the street isn't too loud and busy. We had two rooms during out stay as we were there for 8 days. The first room was situated at the back and you could hear no noise at all! The second room was at the front of the hotel and was a little noisy due to the horns and people outside but once asleep and you never hear them! The rooms were both lovely and in particular our second room was very spacious. We had two queen beds and an infant crib yet had plenty of room. The room and bathroom both looked very modern. I loved the fact that they didn't have things like cotton buds, toothbrushes etc inside the bathroom yet were available ok request at anytime..this saves on space and unecessary waste. The room was always spotless on our return and anything we had requested would be delivered. There was a handy notepad in which you could write any items that you needed (memory foam pillow, flat iron, baby wipes) and they would all be delivered! We were there fromChristmas to New Years and even though it was so busy we never felt neglected! The hotel staff are one of the best I have seen; right from the bell boys to the reception staff, concierge and cleaners. All were very friendly with a big smile. The bell boys in particular were lovely and always welcomed you with a huge smile. New Year's Eve was amazing as we had wristbands and cards so that we could re-enter the street without any hassle. Staying here also meant that we felt the confetti drop on us at 12! And got to walk through to the middle. Hyatt has a restaurant called T45 at the bottom which not only do a good selection of food but also the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted! The only one negative and that is tiny is that the lifts took ages to come. Having said that when they eventually came they were super fast! All in all and amazing stay, we were made to feel very comfortable, always had a lovely nights sleep and it was made to feel like home! Would most certainly recommend to others and also stay again if visiting New York. Top Marks to Hyatt!","London, United Kingdom",28,5.0

This is just annoying they really have to do something about it.On one of the evenings our room key wouldn't open the door so we went to reception to get the key fixed. Went back to the room and it didn't work still. When we went back to the reception it turns out the battery had died on the room lock so we had to wait 20 minutes for maintenance to ""break"" into the room to replace the battery. Of course itwas sleep time for the baby so not impressed.We also asked concierge some advise on where to go in the city and they gave us the wrong info after going where they suggested. Turned out Google was better at giving us correct information.Travelling with a pram was hard enough but when the doormen where constantly talking to girls on the street and not helping to open doors was terrible service.There is no free wifi in your room and we paid a bomb for our stay this really irritates me for this day in age.We did complain to management and all charges from the restaurant where removed but our stay left a bitter taste in the mouth.","Perth, Western Australia, Australia",12,2.0

Our adult children's room on 45 was a King, non-suite. Much better view. Nicely appointed, however as mentioned in other comments-no drawers. My husband made similar comments as others about the front desk area- small, not much character, cramped during busy check-in & check-out periods. The concierge was slow to respond multiple times and provide incorrect information in one instance. ***A special note about Aaron who worked the curb desk. We used Uber and the driver was on 7th due to the traffic pattern and could not make a left on to 45th. Aaron literally walked my 5 person family from the hotel to Times Square direct to the Uber that was waiting for us. Aaron certainly went above and beyond for sure. A point about the elevators...the were slow and on several days at least one was in maintenance. Fortunately, we could use the stairs from the 10th floor to get to the lobby quicker than the wait time for an elevator.

This time I upgraded to the Deluxe View King and absolutely loved my room on the 53rd floor. The difference between the View King that I stayed in before and the Deluxe View King is the bed faces out to an incredible view from a higher floor and the bathroom is bigger with a separate bath and shower 'room' within the bathroom.Once again the service was exceptional from all staff and the room was fresh, immaculate and well proportioned with a very comfortable bed. The nice touches include a shower with two different shower heads, an empty bar fridge (rare in New York) to stock up on supplies, complimentary water, in room coffee machine, floor to ceiling windows (which open slightly for fresh air) and comfy chair to sit and enjoy the spectacular view.I want to draw special attention to the staff - I stay at a lot of hotels and the staff at the Hyatt Times Square are by far consistently the most friendly and professional I have come across. From bellmen, front desk, and housekeeping, everyone was very welcoming and brought a personal touch to my stay (eg., the bellman checked my luggage tag when I arrived in the taxi to address me by name, the front desk employee described my room on check in, housekeeping remembered who I was and which room I was in when I walked past and kindly left additional water when I had a friend up to my room before a show). These are special touches rare in chain hotels that made my stay extra special.Times Square was absolutely crazy over Christmas/New Year, so it was good to be close by for the two nights at the theatre or to turn left out of the hotel and avoid it completely. I should note the lifts can get busy and be a short wait at peak times.I highly recommend the Hyatt Times Square for your Times Square visit.","Sydney, Australia",37,5.0

On this stay, we were not paying directly for the rooms as we used free nights we had previously earned with Hyatt, but the discount price (e.g, AAA) was $100 or more higher than Millennium Broadway.

Surely these days hotels of this standard should be offering free wifi throughout the hotel. The cafe in the lobby was also very expensive. We had a double room on the 33 rd floor.

Unfortunately, the carpet in our room was stained, and I felt that it would nt take much to use a carpet cleaner to clean it because it was nt very pleasant.

The couch turned into a bed, and the door separates the 2 rooms, so it worked well for us as we traveled with our 2 kids. It also has an empty mini fridge which is great!

Great location. New hotel - just a year old. So the rooms are sparkling, the lobby upmarket, and the view from the bar spectacular. We really enjoyed the hotel's location to Times Square, and the fact that it was new, modern, clean, and the front desk people very very friendly and helpful.However, two gripes spoiled the 5 start rating I would like to give it. First, they charge for Internet! I have a real problem with hotels who do this. While they might think it is clever and a great revenue stream, it just forces people to hotspot their phone to get around it, or go to an Apple store. Either way, I resent hotels who think that the Internet is some new way of ripping people off - because the cost to the hotel is a few cents, if that. As I was a Hyatt club member, they waived the charge, but only because they were nice and I complained.Second, when I left I was hit with a $36 ""parcel charge"". I had a few small packages delivered to the hotel from Amazon, as I usually do when I come to the USA. The first three are free, I was told, and then they charge for the rest. So for receiving two small additional packages, I was charged $36! This has never happened to me before, and this charge was certainly not visible when I booked the hotel. I looked on their website, and yes, it is there under one of the tabs if you go looking - but who does? I think it really rude to charge people when they check out for a service that a) they don't know about and b) they cannot do anything about because the packages are on the way.The hotel charges enough for the rooms - the fees here are not cheap. It leaves a really bad taste in you mouth to be slugged additional petty charges - I think the hotel seriously needs to review these sets of charges before they lose loyal customers like us.",Sydney Australia,33,3.0

The room was gorgeous (average NY size hotel room), and really modern. The rooftop bar has a gorgeous view at night, and the feel is relaxing (although I'll ignore the pretentious aspect to it).

This was my first stay at the Hyatt Times Square since my usual NY hotel was booked. Location - Great location if you want to be in Times Square. 5 minute walk to Times Square or Bryant Park. Very close to Rockefeller Center.Rooms - Rooms are well maintained and new. Flat screen tv, comfortable beds, black out curtains that work. A nice sized desk, large bathroom (for NY) with a rain shower (see note below) and heated floors. Shampoos are some line from Gilchrest and Soams.Service - The staff is friendly, chatty and helpful.My issues - The hotel looks good. It basically looks like an Andaz with light colors, instead of dark colors, but it lacks any real amenities. First, there is no in-room dining that I could figure out. The hotel has a ""diner"" (basically a Hyatt mix of a diner and a store with prepackaged water and some snacks) in its lobby that offers take out. Supposedly they will deliver food to your room, but no menus are to be found in the rooms, so it defeats the purpose. There isn't traditional room service at this hotel. Second, the elevators are SLOW and small. I always waited for an elevator and it was always packed.Third, the room has no bathrobes. Not usually an issue, but the rooms have large windows and are quite cold (even with the heat cranked up) during the NY winter evenings.Fourth, there is a fridge in the room, but it is not stocked with anything. They tell you in the fridge to visit the ""diner"" to stock it. Not helpful when i'm thirsty at 2AM and no bottle of water is to be found.Fifth, they charge for internet. Really? Internet? $12 or $16 for the slow/high speed plan? I chose the high speed plan. It was decently fast and reliable, but struggled on streaming video. For $16 I expect some amazing speed.Sixth, the shower sucks. The shower is a nicely tiled walk-in shower, that is quite large, with a tiny rain shower head. Hyatt spent a lot of money on ""Waterworks"" shower equipment but the water pressure is horrendous. The rain shower is nothing more than a trickle. Overall, a nice hard product and friendly staff, but too many things are lacking to make me stay here again.","New York City, New York",215,3.0

We had just finished your of Europe & stayed 3 nights in London before flying to NYC to what we thought would be a wonderful 5 star experience in a new hotel. We arrived by private car & went straight to reception to checkin. I informed them of our reservation (we paid for this room in advance); & the receptionist asked if I would like to pay the $17 extra for a view room (seeing as though this hotel is 55 floors high) I said yes. We were given the keys to our room which was on the 25th floor, room 2505. The view was overlooking buildings across the road & a tiny bit of Times Square. Now the room; bathroom was nice although had to ask for extra towel, shampoo, soap & all other toiletries. Our bed was comfortable however when the kids hopped into theirs we noticed the bottom sheet had all holes in it. The sheets felt just like $50 Kmart sheets, definitely not a Hyatt standard & especially since the hotel is only new. We left it for the night since we knew they would be changed the next day. After spending all day out the next day & getting back to the hotel late we retired to our beds & to our surprise the same holely sheets were there. Left note next day all sheets changed. Carpet in room covered in stains. Wifi is NOT free. Reception area feels very cold not welcoming, no offer to take our 4 suitcases up. Breakfast in restaurant very basic, basic eggs. Concierge desk is not welcoming with no maps on display or anything. To make matters worse we checked out of hotel & went to train station to depart for DC. Once there realised we left our Australian Passports in safe. My husband ran all the way back in pouring rain whilst I rang them advising he was coming. They said they would have them in reception. He got there, Reception knew nothing; housekeeping said they gave to security. Security didn't know anything. They got the Manager & everyone was searching for them. Eventually found them with one of the Security staff. This took well over half an hour. I'm sorry but we will not be staying there again & would not recommend it to anyone.

The range encompasses fast food, Irish pubs, and neighborhood style ethnic fare, to medium & high end restaurants.At the spa, we both had massages.

When we entered NYC I logged onto Travelocity to look at last minute deals and came acroos Hyatt Times Sqaure which was discounted 20% plus allowed a Travelocity coupons ($40) unlike most hotels. I booked 3 days and called the hotel immediately to request a high floor and was told the usual of all hotels its honored upon availability. As we drove up to the hotel they had a valet parking spot which we used for our car, they took care of our luggage immediately, lobby was nice and bright yes on the smaller side but hey this is New York! As we checked in we asked if we could see an Executive Suite and they didn't have any available but she offered to show us a Deluxe Room which was bigger than the Standard, she showed us our room (gave us 38th floor with an amazing view) then took us up the 50th floor to show us the Deluxe Room which was just as beautiful, slightly bigger and it had a bathtub, since we didn't expect for our Standard Room to be sooooo nice we skipped upgrading and kept our room. The room was double beds with a stunning view, new bathroom with heated floor and probably one of the cleanest rooms we had ever booked, my husband and I travel alot with our son who is highly allergic and have issues with hotel room cleanliness most of the time, we we have traveled all over the states, Europe and go to Mexico twice a year and we can safely say this is the nicest room we have ever stayed in! It was very clean, nice bathroom and my God, bedding, the bedding, ahhhhh finally someone does good linens with down comforters!!!! The hotel was located a block away from Times Square, close to everything and probably one of the cleanest streets in the neighborhood, with street closure on Saturdays with many vendors and food stands, we loved it!!! The staff was pleasant and friendly, always acknowledging the guests and openning the doors. We loved our stay, some of the minor negatives were slow elevators, there was 5 of them I beleive but it was still a bit slow, nothing major, the bar/cafe in the lobby is overpriced, the smallest bottle of Pepsi I had no idea existed was $3! Ouch!!!!! Now, my biggest negative, a mothers point of view, mother of a 7 year old, was the window in our room, it was a stunning view with a window that could be opened, and I don't mean just opened I mean reached and opened by a 7 year old, no screen protection whatssoever, none, no security/safty lock anywhere! Wow what a mistake Hyatt! I keep an eye on my son and brainwash him about safety all the time but I found this to be a big flaw figuring we were on the 38th floor and again only because it was accesible and openable by kids. That would be our only flaw (mothers biggest) other than that we absolutely LOVED every minute of our stay and will definitely book again in the future!!!",,2,5.0

I did not like the lobby at all, it was small, crowded and awkward. There were 6 elevators, 3 of which were fast ones (they skipped quite a few floors and went to the upper floors fast), but we often had to wait for the elevator on the way down for a very long time. Had lunch at the cafe in the lobby and we all were very disappointed with our food, I would not eat there again.

Rooms, as in most Hyatts, are not huge but we needed two beds and it was just fine my friend and I. The beds were comfortable. The bathrooms clean and new. The staff was friendly and helpful. I did hate the name tags they wore. Notice them, they are hand done by each staff member. It looked a little unprofessional to me. But that was our only complaint. Oh the elevators are slow.

The first impression of the hotel came as I exited the cab with my bags and walked past 3 staff members – not one with a greeting or a “may I help you with your bags.” Entering the very small lobby of this large hotel I found 3 front desk agents assisting other guests. I was waved up and after giving my information the agent looked and said the computer shows my room marked as clean and ready but would have a manager check it first. I was asked to have a seat in the lobby while the room was checked. With limited seating and lots of other guests already waiting I claimed a spot in the center of the lobby and stood while waiting. I found it interesting the number of staff people they had standing post or walking around with suits on – yet none greeted guests or inquired if anyone needed help as there were several people just standing in the lobby. After about 20 minutes I saw the agent that checked me in standing behind the desk – I got her attention and she acknowledged that my room was ready. I wondered if I had stood there longer if she would have remembered me or not. I was given my keys to the 27th floor and directed to the bank of elevators. I was kind of surprised being a Platinum member that I was only getting a room on the 27th floor – but I wasn’t going to say anything and then have to wait in the lobby any longer. Elevators:Be prepared to wait…. And wait…. And wait. Especially during peak hours for sure. I found the norm was 5 to 6 minutes – shorter in the late night hours. The Room:I had a King room with the Terrace. The common areas were very clean but the hallways were extremely bright. The Terrace was very nice with two chairs and a small table with a decent view. The room itself was also very clean and typical of a Hyatt room. I didn’t find the bed to be as comfortable as other Hyatt beds and the pillows certainly weren’t like the others. I did like how they have electrical outlets on both sides of the bed. This is something any new hotel should be doing with so many people using electronics these days. Internet connection was very good in the room. The only issue I had with it was that they made you log in each day. At the Austin Hyatt if you are staying for 3 days it shows that you have 72 hours of usage. The bathroom was very nice and certainly a decent size for a NY hotel. The best part was the shower, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced such strong water pressure. From both the rainforest head to the wand it was the best for sure. It reminded me of the Seinfeld episode when the Super was changing out showerheads in Jerry’s apartment building. Housekeeping was amazing. I cannot say enough about their housekeeping staff – at least for the 27th floor. Even for waking up late each day the room was done by the time I would return and was spotless. I didn’t visit the rooftop bar or their lobby restaurant so I cannot comment on either of those. When I checked out on Monday I ran into the same issue as when I arrived – walked past several staff members who didn’t say a word. As I stood at the curb looking at the stopped traffic hoping to find a cab a bellman did approach and asked “what airport.” I told him LGA and he said, “would you like one of the sedans that we have…. I cut him off knowing what he was doing. You will see town cars or SUV’s parked out front; these drivers pay bellman cash to get passengers going to airports. Some bellman even charge cabbies a certain amount depending the airport – so in addition to your tip they are already receiving a couple extra bucks from your cabbie. To be clear, I am not suggesting that this is what this bellman was doing or that this deal is happening at the Hyatt Times Square. Anyway, the problem with hailing a cab in front of the Hyatt in the middle of the afternoon is heavy traffic. Even if I had found a cab I would have just been sitting in traffic heading into Times Square with even worse traffic. I ended up walking over to 5th Ave and jumped in a cab there. With this property being new I believe the Hyatt people will get the kinks worked out and get everything running smoothly. The two other agents working the frontn desk when I checked in, Nico & Danilo, seemed to really know how to interact with guests. I am in NY about 6 or 7 times a year, my go-to hotel was sold out during this trip. I might try the Hyatt Times Square again in the future, get upstairs and see their rooftop bar and of course for that shower!","Elyria, Ohio",83,4.0

The rooms were nice and clean, albeit a bit small, and the location is great. The staff was pretty good overall. Those that seemed to be more senior and experienced were extremely helpful, friendly, professional and accommodating. The more junior staff such as those that were at the front desk at night seemed to be inexperienced. For example, a lot of hotels offer the option of pre-ordering breakfast in the room by hanging something on your door at night, and the reaction that I received when asking whether this was an option was as if I was speaking Martian. Still, I was eventually offered the option of having the front office staff submit my order ahead of time, but it did take the front office person having to check a few times with someone in a room near the desk to come up with this idea. Something like this seems like a pretty basic option, and I think the late night staff could be a bit better trained with what I would think is not an usual request. I also had to deal with one member of the concierge staff that was a bit condescending, but after her restaurant recommendation didn't have items on its menu that I specifically had said my friend and I wanted, I nicely gave her a card from a sister restaurant that was next door to her recommendation to let her know that maybe she was not quite as smart as she thinks she is. Other than her, however, the staff was very friendly and professional even if some need some more seasoning.

The staff that we encountered were all very pleasant. We had dinner and breakfast a few times in the hotel restaurant mostly because it was convenience.

It was a nice touch. There is also a coffeepot and bottled water in the room. It was all very good. I should also mention that the hotel has high speed elevators and there was seldom any wait for one even though at times the hotel was busy. The 53rd was also quiet - obviously being so high up. I would recommend staying here if you want to be in the heart of everything especially if you are in town for Broadway shows. All in all a good stay.

It would be nice to have a free standard WiFi and to have to pay only if high speed is required.- Lobby is quite small, but this is not really a big deal as this is not a place where you spend a lot of time anyway.- The windows are not so well soundproofed, you can still hear some streets noise at high floors. Anyway you are in New York and not in the middle of country side so, again, this is not a big deal I think.- The rooftop bar is open only as of 4pm and not accessible at all to children. This is a pity we were not allowed to have a drink with our children and enjoy the view. I understand that access could be restricted to children at a certain point of the evening but that would be nice to extend opening hours and allow families to enjoy this facility as well.Overall it was a very good experience.

There is even a stand out on the street where you can ask for directions, suggestions for activities and other things. I kmow...you're thinking concierge service, but it's more than that. The guy that works there is great and I felt like we were old friends just talking to him. The Sky Bar is a great touch too. Imagine enjoying dinner and fun conversation sitting 54 floors up overlooking the city. You can clearly see the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building from the outdoor seating.

On my last trip to New York, I stayed on Wall Street and did not like being that far south in the city. I decided to give the Hyatt Times Square due to the central the location of the hotel (45th between 6th and 7th Ave), booked a good rate and was able to secure a Corner Room a Suite upgrade. The Hyatt Times Square opened in December 2013 and is within a 5/10 minute walk of over a dozen subway lines. If you are traveling with large luggage I would not advise taking the subway as very few stations have escalators or elevators. Also, trudging through TimesSquare with luggage is a hassle. Upon arrival at the hotel, guests are given an option of using a kiosk to check-in or using the traditional check-in desk. I attempted to use the kiosk to check-in, but ran into issues because my room was not ready. Given that my suite upgrade was complimentary, I did not have an issue waiting for it to be available. I dropped off my luggage at the front desk to hold while I went out and grabbed a late lunch. The front desk called my mobile phone when my room was ready and I returned to the hotel. It would have been nice if the front desk arranged to have my luggage delivered to my room, but that did not happen. When I got back to the hotel, I completed the checkin process and was given my room key (RFID/NFC). The lady a the check-in desk inquired if this was my first time at the property. When I replied that it was, she seemed a little surprised and provided me with a free drink voucher (in addition to the 1k bonus diamond points). I then proceeded to the elevator bank, which is poorly designed. There are two elevators that serve floors 2-25 and three elevators that serve floors 26-54. Be prepared to wait during peak and some non-peak hours. Room 4907 is a corner suite room that faces South and has superb views of Times Square, Chrysler Building and the Freedom Tower. The living room and bedroom are sufficient in size (neither too big or small), but may get a little tight if you have more than two adults staying in the room. Both rooms contained lots of windows, even some that opened a few inches. As both rooms have southerly facing views, they receive lots of natural sunlight. The bathroom was quite large and contained a large soaking tub, separate shower and heated floors. The bath products were acceptable, but I was not interested in bringing them home with me. Overall, I enjoyed my stay (and the views) at the Hyatt Times Square and would consider staying here again. Hopefully the slow elevator situation will be addressed soon.

After days of searching the internet, I came up with the Hyatt Times Square, and was not disappointed. Everyone we came into contact with was cheerful, polite and helpful. I had requested that at least 1 of the rooms be ready for an early check-in, as we were taking a train in to the city, but needed to do a quick change to get ready to see a show. This request was granted, which made the turnaround much easier. The rooms were comfortable and clean, and the girls appreciated the fact that the bathrooms had a long run of counter, so that they could spread out. We were on floors 29, 30 and 31, and were not bothered by any street noise.

If you are going to New York to take in plays and musicals on Broadway, this hotel is in a great location. I saw four plays in three days and never had to take a taxi as all of the theaters were within just a few short blocks of the hotel.

BUT not all make excellent customer service appear completely effortless and enjoyable. At the Hyatt Times Square it doesn't feel like customer service, it feels like just the way they do things as people.I want to make special mention of the door men who were charm itself and made friends with my Dad who has trouble walking and was suffering from a stomach bug.

I rang up to ask for a hotel car for a pickup at JFK but was told there was none and that the cab would be my best option. The cabbie was not the least friendly so my intro to NY was not the best. It didnt help boost our expections in the Big Apple. We heard so much from reviews that the corner suite had views to die for. The booking office in Australia (I wouldn't exactly call them friendly nor informed) assured me there would be a Roll Away bed but was told on arrival that the corner suite was too small for one and that the couch would not be good for sleeping. However, they did move us the next day to a higher room which seemed more fitting for the name ""corner suite"". This was in the ""right"" or Times Square end of the building perhaps not as restricted in space and with the same couch but apparently this one is a couch bed - opens up into a bed. Do not ask the concierge or reception or anyone for advise for chances are you'll be given unbelievably bad ones: 1. according to one the best and only Thai is a Japanese fusion restaurant-bar across the road (fried rice and the fried noodles was of mid-primary school level, forget the rest). 2. according to another the best Thai, it had no taste whatsoever even though we over-ordered to minimise the risk of disappointment., 3. the third recommendation was a Chinese restaurant.Lastly, it was my wife's birthday so I asked Ryan the concierge if he could put a card or flowers or even chocolates in the room whilst we were out. He said he would see what he could do but fortunately I did not hold my breath.Oh, the takeout soup at the lobby store (this place is so limited for choice we did not bother after that) spilled out at the lid so my wife had to go back down to the store. We were told not to worryabout paying, it's free. But it wasn't free because it was in our room account and I did not bother arguing....I wasn't after a freebie.

The lobby is smallish and stark, black and white and without chairs and tables and felt rather cave-like. Maybe the designer didn’t want guests lounging around and cluttering the place up. Whatever the reason, it’s not very welcoming, so it’s a good thing the Hyatt staff made up for this by being very friendly.We’d booked on-line and opted for the $20 room upgrade “if available” but were given two upgrades. This got us a fairly spacious room with a good-sized balcony and a view over Times Square. Noise was not an issue: with the balcony door shut we heard nothing.The room itself was spotlessly clean and in excellent condition and the bed was very comfortable. Likewise the bathroom, which continued the black and white theme, was immaculate. (Incidentally, there’s no bath, just a very good shower.) Two very minor gripes were a lack of counter space to spread toiletries over and a towel shortage. (Yes we could have called down for more but it wasn’t that big of a deal.)One point to note: it’s difficult to get a cab from outside the hotel. We tried twice and failed, on one occasion walking up to 6th Ave and when we were heading to the airport using the hotel’s “limo” service.

For our first trip to New York City, the Hyatt staff made us feel at home and welcome from the get-go. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. We were celebrating our anniversary and they made us feel special. From the excellent check-in experience, which included a greeting from the on-duty manager, to the follow up phone calls, excellent advice and responses to our questions and generally just pleasant interactions any time we walked into the lobby. We felt like true VIPs. Advice from the team ahead of our visit and during our stay was greatly appreciated. The recommendations allowed us to plan out our days and make the most of our experience. In particular, the neighbourhood suggestions were quite helpful (we would not have known about The Highline or great views and walk-ability of the Brooklyn Bridge without their advice); the overall willingness to help and answer questions really made us feel at home and like part of the Hyatt family.There were simple yet effective measures the staff took and we want to highlight them here in hopes that this kind of service excellence is mimicked at other hotels:- Quick response times to email queries ahead of our stay- Detailed responses- Smiles – everyone we talked to had a smile on their face. From the front desk to the bellmen, to the housekeeping and maintenance staff, we noticed everyone was happy and took time to say hello. Staff seemed to enjoy working. That’s rare for a guest to experience.- The value of a hello – we were greeted leaving and entering the hotel. It made us feel welcome and appreciated.- The value of a follow up call – within 30 minutes of checking in, enough time to get settled and unpacked, we were greeted with a follow up call to ensure everything was up to our standards. We had a second follow up call on the day after from a staff member.- Proximity – the location of this hotel in Times Square but in a spot where you have room on the sidewalks (so not right in the chaos of Broadway) is a huge selling feature.- Cleanliness – the hotel was spotless everywhere we went. Our room in particular was always spotless. - Modernity – the building and rooms were equipped with the latest in technology and modern amenities – we loved the shower head and the ability to plug in using HDMI cables.- Service excellence – from a sewing kit to help determining best times for travel, everything we needed was accommodated. Our experience was top notch and unparalleled. They went the extra mile and it will influence our future bookings. We will be back in NYC down the road and, with certainty, we will be using Hyatt hotels in the future for our travel.","Victoria, Canada",30,5.0

Well, as I often do, I research hotels I'm unfamiliar with here on Trip Advisor.To begin, I always look for the ratio of good versus bad reviews. In both of those types, I look for a common thread of positives and negatives.Anyway, that's how I arrive at my choice of hotel(s). If I have several candidates I like to give priorityto a new or newer hotel. My pick on my family's vacation visit to New York City was the Hyatt Times Square.It was a new hotel ( building) just 9 months old.We booked 2 rooms for a 4 night stay. One for my wife and myself and the other for our son.I should mention here that my son has a great deal of difficulty sleeping even though he is on a highdose of prescription medication.For this reason I reached out to Ryan who is the Director of Rooms at the Hyatt.What a nice, cordial gentleman! He could not possibly have helped us in our reservation requests any more than he did.We asked for a connecting rooms on a high floor away from corridor noise.While Ryan could not obtain connecting rooms for us, he did come up with a great alternative.He put our rooms on opposite sides in a private vestibule-type set up through 2 private doors from the hallway.The location of the rooms on the 50th floor gave us great distance from the noise of the Times Square area far below. Ryan also, asked if there was anything else he could do for us.I gave into temptation and mentioned our son enjoyed a special soft drink which we found difficult to obtain while traveling. He responded, ""Well, I'll see what I can do.""When entering our room, Ryan left a note on my desk saying to look in my son's fridge for a surprise.Yes, he did stock our son's fridge with a dozen cans of his very difficult to obtain favorite drink!Ryan is a marvel as is all the other personnel we met at the Hyatt. Nothing too little or too bigwas beyond their efforts for us.The rooms, while not the largest were larger than most in new york city. They were very well thought out. The beds at Hyatt are truly a comfort for the ages. The bathrooms while not huge are again, very well thought out. The closet space was excellent. My wife had three large suitcases fullof clothes and they all fit easily in there. The lighting in the rooms was everywhere and easy to operate from several locations throughout.The television was also very easy to operate and had a nice selection of movies and sporting events to offer.Housekeeping was always handy or a phone call away.My wife asked for a scale and a microwave oven which were brought up in a few minutes.We did not dine in the hotel as we had booked our reservations at various places before we left home. However, we did visit the hotel's rooftop bar and enjoyed several drinks along with popcorn, salty nuts and some chips with dip for a midnight snack.The hotel itself is in an excellent area of Times Square. Not too close but yet an easy stroll to the Square itself with a multitude of shops, restaurants, theaters, and so much more all around us.Cabs were easy to get as our doormen were always ready to assist night and day.All in all a most enjoyable visit to New York.Much thanks to Ryan and the very eager and helpful staff at Hyatt Times Square.","Culver City, California",0,5.0

I can't say I was said to leave NY but I was definitely sad to leave the Hyatt and their staff. I will always have fond memories of them and want to thank them again for making our stay as wonderful as it was. Best wishes!","Perth, Australia",0,5.0

The hotel rooms (especially the bathrooms) were spotlessly clean and modern. Huge shower with heated flooring in main bathroom area. Had a corner room on a higher floor overlooking Times Square. It's worth paying the extra for a 'view' room. Lifts were quick and efficient - no excessive waiting even at peak times. Views from the rooftop bar very impressive. Staff were exceptionally helpful, especially Tess on the concierge desk and one of the doormen outside the main entrance (youngish chap - didn't catch his name?).Only area where the hotel needs to improve is by offering complementary WiFi in their guest bedrooms. Having to constantly go down to reception was very inconvenient. If free WiFi had been offered in guest rooms I would have given a 5 star rating.

We absolutely loved it!!! From the moment we walked into the hotel we were made to feel our custom was appreciated. We had walked from Penn Station with our suitcases and it was a very hot and humid evening. We were greeted by Floyd on reception - who immediately produced two bottles of water for us whilst we checked in. We were upgraded to a suite (this never happens to us - we were really chuffed!) The room was lovely with a view across the city. The bathroom was amazing and the bed was huge! Housekeeping was brilliant - whilst the room was very clean and had everything we needed, there was a list of complementay items that we could request if needed. We were given a 20% discount voucher for the restaurant by Floyd on arrival but due to other commitments we didnt' get to try this. However, we did nip up to the roof-top bar for a drink and something to eat of our first night . Whist a bit pricy, I did consider it worth every penny for the experience - one of the tallest roof-top bars in NYC, and excellent service. It was an experience. When we checked out, we were pleased it was Floyd that then checked us out, and he arranged for our luggage to be stored whilst we did some last minute shopping in the city. If I were to visit NYC again, I would without doubt stay in this hotel again, and will be recommneding it to friends. Nothing was too much trouble and the location was fab. Thank you to Floyd, Housekeeeping and the roof-top bar staff who helped to make the end of our trip so memorable.","Woodbridge, United Kingdom",10,5.0

Checked in to my hotel room and found a hole in the comforter. I called down and asked to have it replaced they said someone will be right up. No one ever came to change it. The next day housekeeping cleaned the room and put the same comforter on the bed. The hole was right in the center of the comforter and easily seen as it was not a small hole. Finally 45 mins after calling again they came up to change it. You would think the next comforter would be free of holes right? Well it wasnt. There was still another hole in this one in almost the exact same spot. Also their A/C system is very poor. After walking around the city all day we were tired and sweating. All we wanted to do was go and relax in our cool room. When we get in the room it was at 80 degrees not at the 69 degrees we put it at in the morning. There excuse was it is a eco friendly unit. Even when your sleeping we set it at 69 and in the morning it was up to 78 degrees. Not very comfortable at all waking up sweating. For a brand new property built from the ground up they could have made more spacious elevators as they were tiny and always crammed with alot of people.

It was a very enjoyable experience. Location wise its great, very quiet and peaceful but literally minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The reception is very nice and the staff incredibly helpful and the restaurant on the ground floor is fantastic for breakfast and reasonably priced. Our room was incredibly clean and a good size for a family of 4 and the bathroom was done to a high standard with lovely complimentary treats supplied and available on request. After a day sightseeing in New York it was lovely place to come back to. The bar on the 54th floor looked lovely, but unfortunately you are not able to drink up there with children under 21. They let us look out though at the view as it is the highest bar in Manhatten. My only bug bear is the charge for Wifi and something like $30 a day. As a tourist just wanting to look up a restaurant's menu or something simple like that once a day, its seems extortionate. This could put some people off. I had it as a negative when choosing the hotel as I think this should definately be part of the cost. However I did get a really good deal by callng the hotel direct and I am so glad we stayed. Anyway, if you want a lovely, clean hotel in a great location near Times Square at a reasonable price, you can't go far wrong with the Hyatt Times Square.","St. Albans, United Kingdom",9,5.0

First impressions was that it was just my style. I like everything new and modern. This hotel is just that. The staff were friendly and accomodating. I was able to upgrade to an executive suite for free (for being a CC holder) upon check in. I was so happy with the upgrade as the suite was probably the largest suite/room I've ever stayed in while visiting New York. The room overall was immaculate. Before checkout we ate breakfast in their restaurant and the food was very good. I won't comment on the price as everything is pricy in NY and it's to be expected. Only negatives are that the lobby was extremely small and there is hardly any seating. I didn't mind standing THAT much plus I found a small stool to sit on while waiting on my room. However, I couldn't imagine coming here with my parents who can't stand for long periods of time. One other small issue I had was, the seating area was kind of unkept. There was someone's dirty napkin on a seat and two or three water bottles around empty. Again, this isn't huge for me, but it looks bad that the entire time I waited (45min) no one came to clean it up. Hotels such as Hyatt should have employees actively looking for things like this. Other useful information:As usual, whenever I travel, I try to stay at Hyatts because I earn triple the points at Hyatt properties for having the credit card.I booked this trip back in April and I received a discounted rate, again for being a CC member.","Baltimore, Maryland",12,4.0

Finally, I thought this to be one of the best use of lobby area and public space without wasting vast amounts of square footage. Loved the restaurant which also had a small take out coffee bar.

Went up to the 54th to see the bar with outside seating, nice view but not spectacular as there are many other tall buildings obstructing the view. Our room had two queen beds, but no armchair or couch, if you wanted to sit in your room at all, basically you were on the bed. The street was closed two days in a row, once for a street fair and once for a parade, which was a bit of an issue for my elderly mother. We had to have cabs drop us off a block away.

The front desk personnel actually had read my Hyatt Passport profile and knew what I liked and didn't like - wow! The rooms are beautiful, modern décor, clean, spacious (yes, in NYC!), soft bedding, fluffy towels.. the bathrooms are ultra-gorgeous, marble and glass, with heated floors!!! (showers only, I believe). The electronic connector in the room let's you project your computer screen via HDMI to your 42""+ TV LCD screen. There are al sorts of adapters and other techie options to use for those who want. Beds are a perfect mix of soft enough to be comfortable, but plenty of support beneath - not too firm, not saggy.The service is fantastic - every response is catered to nearly instantaneously with exceptional courtesy. The concierge - he was fantastic. Scored us last minute tickets to the Book of Mormon through the hotel's broker and got me a better price than I had found anywhere else (and I know how to find them). Answered my 50K questions with interest and gave us lots of useful information, such as suggestions for getting to places faster, how to avoid the crowds when walking, where to eat before the show (without spending 2 hours on a wait), etc.Room service was a little underwhelming in terms of food - everything came on paper plates and in take-out format. My son liked the food, I didn't, but that could be personal preference. I have to hand it to the restaurant manager - Michael - though: I had a minor health issue with one food item and asked to have it removed. Not only did he call me back to remove that item, he removed the entire tab for that meal, sent me water and asked if there was anything else he could do or if I wanted anything else on the house. WOW! Exceeded my expectations completely.Location is great for walking to places nearby in mid-town and via close-by subway (and cabs) to anywhere in the city or beyond. Only a few blocks from Penn Station, it was a 10 min walk with our carry-on bags to get to the train to Newark airport (which is by the way the fastest way to get to the airport and by far the cheapest).Roof-top bar - awesome hosts and waitstaff, who found me a seat outside within minutes, even though the restaurant was full. Good food, great view, music playing in the background. On a summer day it's a great place to have a little night cap.The purpose of our trip was to visit Columbia University and do a little sight-seeing along the way, and we accomplished that with ease.

Overall the hotel had lovely rooms and friendly, helpful staff. Despite these positives, everything else about the hotel was average and I walked away grateful for the staff's efforts but not wanting to stay there again. I should also mention that because I grew up in New York, I am perhaps more picky about my hotels there than in other cities. Details follow-I called the hotel in the days leading up to my stay to tell them that I would be arriving very early and because of a frantic travel schedule, I would likely not have slept the night before and asked if they could do everything they could to have my room ready for an early check-in. They assured me they would try but also warned that occupancy that week was very high so they really could promise anything. I understood that. I arrived at about 8:30 in the morning, heavily sleep deprived. The doorman was busy helping other guests so a hotel employee in a suit (later identified as the assistant F&B manager) came out and helped me with my very heavy luggage. I appreciated this. It is not every hotel where a member of management would step in for the bell team. The doormen were able to eventually assist me and were very friendly and helpful throughout my stay. Even the security guys around the door were friendly and got me an umbrella when I had forgotten one. All those ladies and gentlemen provided five-star service. I was checked-in by a friendly young man who was in his second or third day at the property so he was being trained by a more senior employee. I was informed that my room was not ready. I asked if they could rush a room as I hadn't slept. They said they would try and thought they could offer me a room in about an hour. Again, I thought that was reasonable and appreciated their efforts. Then things started to go downhill-The hotel has hundreds of rooms if I recall somewhere in the 500-700 range yet it has virtually no lobby so the lobby can comfortably seat somewhere between 8-10 people. There is one small couch and a handful of ottomans used as seats. That is it. That meant there really was no place to sit. Even the benches in the restaurant and service counter were often full. So, if I didn't want to leave the hotel, all I could do was pace back and forth or sit on the floor. After about 45 mins. I checked with the desk who didn't have a room for me. I checked back at 90 minutes, again no room and no estimate of when a room might be ready. I might be able to get a seat for 10-15 minutes before losing it again or having to get up to stretch, etc. When I used one of the lobby restrooms it was filthy. I notified the concierge who did not offer an apology. After two hours of largely pacing back and forth I asked again if they could get me a room and the desk still couldn't provide a room or an estimate of when one would be ready. Further complicating things was that the Wi-Fi in the lobby was not working so throughout the entire time I could not even get any work done on my laptop. Finally a little shy of three hours since I began to wait they found me a room. The room itself was lovely and clean with excellent water pressure, comfortable mattress, and modern furnishings. I had no complaints about the condition of the room. Pictures on the website accurately describe the state of rooms so I will not go into extensive detail here. After a much needed nap, I came downstairs to ask a couple of questions. I was meeting some friends for drinks at the Langham a well-known luxury hotel in the City. I had forgotten the cross-streets and asked the concierge to look them up for me. She provided me an address four blocks away from the actual hotel and I ended up being about 30 minutes late for my meeting. I understand mistakes happen but to get such a basic thing wrong was a surprise. I dealt with one gentleman at concierge who nice but the two ladies I dealt with were really indifferent. Another issue with service was that front desk staff doubled as the bellmen. This is the new ""host"" system Hyatt has and I must say I don't like it, particularly at a property this big. Hire a handful of real, dedicated bellmen, please. First, both times when I called for luggage assistance the two, very nice young ladies that arrived were smaller than the luggage I was asking them to carry. I felt badly for making them carry my luggage. Also, every time a guest called for luggage assistance or some other service someone at the front desk had to stop working and go the guest room, this meant that front desk service, while friendly, was slow. I know those front desk people were working as hard as they can and it undermines their ability to succeed by making them both front desk clerks and bell people. Finally, I ordered breakfast before i left the next morning and was told that they really didn't have traditional room service but they would bring me breakfast in to go containers: paper plates, paper cups, plastic silverware, etc. I agreed. The breakfast was good but not great and cost something in the range of $50. For $50 to be sipping a to-go cup of orange juice was really galling. Additionally, the quality of the smoked salmon and bagel was not very good (other items were more edible) but in a city where there are wonderful bagels and lox everywhere I was surprised the hotel did such a poor job (at such high prices). I eventually took my complaints to a manager who was kind enough to remove a couple of room charges because of the problems with my stay. This was handled very professionally. Overall, while the property has great potential, I was left feeling that there were better options for the money in NYC so unless you really have to be in Times Sq. or you can get this property at a substantially better price than others I would stay elsewhere.","New Haven, Connecticut",159,3.0

We knew we could just walk out the door and be close to the action. What I did not expect was to walk down the hallway to our room and see such fun colors along the way. Most hotels use browns and other blah colors, but this one had fun, warm, colorful designs. When we opened up our room, both of us commented on how cute the decor was. Not only was it modern, but the use of fun colors really brightened up the room. The decorations on the walls were so much fun to look at. The platform beds were huge and comfy with modern bedding. There was a mini-frig built into the desk and a safe. I would like to include photos of the charming room, but my computer is not allowing me to access my photos for this review. Must be a glitch with Trip Advisor?The bathroom was utra-modern with gorgeous flooring in black and off-white colors. The entire walls were gorgeous too and there was a rain-head on the shower. Although we were not in the room much, it is NYC after all, we really enjoyed this room. That night we went up to the rooftop bar and saw the spectacular skyline with all the bright lights. SO pretty! The next morning, we ate at the coffee shop. We really enjoyed our eggs and bacon. There was a healthy omelette option which I hope to try the next visit to this hotel. The air conditioning was amazing. Most hotels, you can't really monitor the temperature, but this worked beautifully! I really appreciated it in the August heat!

Spent a week at the Hyatt Times Square in July, 2014 for both personal and business pleasure. Would have given it a 4 had it been more conducive to business travel and better elevator service. There is no business center but rather two computers set up in the hall behind the check-in desk/concierge - no privacy. Typically, this would be fine as I travel with a laptop, but in this instance I had several business docs to print out. The elevators are slow anyway. But, on two separate occasions during my stay, one of the elevators was blocked off for private access to the bar on the top floor. No one was waiting to get up to the bar. However, guests were waiting for the other elevators to get to their rooms. I thought it a real discourtesy to inconvenience hotel guests.

The service staff from the check in to check out, concierge and all that goes within was top class. Well for me that makes a huge difference. The hotel neat and chic. Yes it has a really busy/ claustrophobic lobby mainly due to the shortage of space. The rooms though really tiny are neatly appointed well lit and bright. Lots of plug points to charge your phones/ cameras and tablets. The bed was comfortable, the toiletries decent and most so the room was brightly lit and decorated with really happy colours. We wanted the room early so we settled for a smaller room which was available before the actual check in time, it was a squeeze but was fine for us. The rooms like the ones in the pictures so you actually get what you pay forOnly thing that do not work for this property is the long way for the elevators. Wish they did something about that.In a nut shell I am so happy I stayed here. I am very cost conscious – especially in NYC because one is hardly in the room in this city… but staying here ensured that I walked almost everywhere which saved expensive cab fare… Also I moved to this hotel after a previous month stay at the dreary Hotel Penn and it was such a delightful experience.Recommendations, revisits – Yes Definitely. Just hoping they do not become too expensive for my merge purse.","Singapore, Singapore",68,4.0

It as all the glamour, and the same crowd as the transit authority.if you are a businessman, RUN!Other hotels have done a MUCH BETTER job of opening a hotel off Times Square, while still holding on to their core values and 'brand' image. The Intercontinental Times Square did this BEAUTIFULLY. Hyatt really failed here.Aside from the terribly small lobby, the rooms are contemporary and clean. Nothing great, nothing bad. Could be a new Holiday Inn Express, Sheraton...anyone.Diamond Amenity never delivered. Not a big surprise...Dinner in the 'restaurant' was awful. Again, not your typical Hyatt...just a somewhat trendy 'diner' off the lobby. No cocktail lounge, nothing. Dinner was awful. I was the ONLY person there, and now i know why. Breakfast the next morning was fine. Great morning service. I have a gut feeling that this is not even a Hyatt Dining room....seems 'third party' to me.The health club was good, plenty of cadio machines. Never went to the SPA, and to be honest, would never want to go in this environment.There are much better Hyatt hotels just blocks away.

Usually, the end of a day in Manhattan meant the IND followed by the LIRR.Most of my stays in Manhattan over the last 30 years have been business only with my expenses paid by my employer and generally a typical, mediocre hotel room someplace in midtown Manhattan. However, this trip was strictly pleasure, five days in Manhattan with a number of shows and museums (and some kosher deli!) with my wife.The Hyatt Times Square was perfect for our needs. Can you say “location, location, location?” Excellent location on West 45th off of Times Square, but not actually on Times Square. Easy access to subways, theatres, restaurants, ...The Hyatt Times Square is a relatively new hotel with modern furnishings throughout. Our room on the 33rd floor was reasonably large and generally well furnished. The bathroom had an excellent large stall shower (I hate hotel bathtubs for taking showers - slippery and dangerous - and most guests take showers and not baths) and a shaving mirror (very helpful for men) and was both well lit and ventilated.Bed was very comfortable, room was very quiet (despite being so close to Times Square), and we both slept very well. Room ventilation worked very well (both heat and air conditioning) and relatively quietly.All facilities were exceptionally clean and well-maintained. Housekeeping does an excellent job of making up each room each day as if we were new guests.All staff we interacted with, including housekeeping staff, were very friendly and helpful (and I might add, English speaking which isn't the case in many hotels in the United States these days).This is not an inexpensive hotel. (If you are on a very strict budget, look elsewhere!) On the other hand, it was no more expensive than the other brand name hotels in Midtown Manhattan and the facilities were at least as good if not better than any other non-luxury hotel that I've stayed at in the area.Negatives? Very few, but for the record ... The room desk should have a comfortable desk chair, especially since many of the hotel's guests are either there on business or doing some business while there on pleasure (my case). The hotel offers complimentary internet access. It is reliable, but each connection is limited to 5mb/sec bandwidth, much slower than my cellphone's 4G/LTE service! Although this limitation is probably in place to assure that all guests can fairly share in the hotel's overall bandwidth, it is somewhat restrictive for business use.Finally, the hotel has a restaurant off the lobby at which we had breakfast one day. Food was OK but very much overpriced for what you got.We would definitely return to this hotel if and when our travel finds us in Midtown Manhattan again!","Saratoga, California",62,5.0

Check in was terrific with a welcome, took our bags and we went out for the afternoon and received a call when our room was ready. Recommend upper floors and front of building if you can get them, Elevators were a little odd if your room was lower than 29th floor you had to change on 25 for the roof top bar, which was amazing! Not to be missed....view was wonderful at sunset, evening and daytime....Service was extraordinarily slow - had to go to bar to order once evening because time was tight. A/C was slightly noisy and freezing, but when we turned temp up the heater came on! LOVED the rain shower! One of the check out clerks asked me to wait on line (11am is busy) then proceeded to take someone who walked up to the counter, which was annoying since I was trying to get to the airport.

It iwas a great room for a good price, I've paid more for much less in the past... Now the bathroom.. I love, love, love Hyatt bathrooms. This one has a large -again, very large for New York- bathroom with a walk in shower and temperature controlled floors. I love warm floors in the bathroom. I have to mention housekeeping. They do a beautiful job and our rooms was ready early and toiletries and towels always replenished.Fantastic gym. Brand new equipment, clean, clean clean. There is a rooftop bar... meh... it was too crowded for a Monday night. The host was a bit prickly and the waitress was slammed but sweet and friendly. It was clear to me they were understaffed that night. We did not mind, we sat outside and enjoyed the great view.Breakfast at restaurant downstairs has a bit of a pricey menu but food is great and they refill your OJ (that tastes like it's fresh squeezed). I loved the ""diner inspired"" decor but mostly the service. Our server Rey went out of his way for us (it was a special occasion for us) which is nice, but seriously, it is this kind of service that makes one want to always return somewhere.

It may take you a while to get to the roof or your floor in this hotel, the elevators take forever and many times you wait for 5 minutes and the elevator comes and there is no room in it to get in.

A very warm welcome at reception and although we had arrived earlier than check in time, our room was ready. We were on 43rd floor. Very good modern clean room. Everything you required. Liked to swivel chair, so you could easily swing around to take in views from room. Staff always greeted you in & out of hotel and were most helpful with tips on thingsto do or directions. Free WIfi in public areas - we used pc with concierge for return online airline boarding check in. Very close to Times Square and theatres - a few doors away from Lyceum, but just far enough to get away from hustle & bustle. We had breakfast & evening meal a couple of times in the diner. At first glance it seems expensive but portions are very large (compared to UK). Bar 54 was great - again not cheap but worth it. Great views of NY from hotel's 54th floor.

And it was worth the price to have such a nice, clean hotel so close to the Broadway shows we were there to see. It was also a relief that the restaurant was not a high-priced swanky place, but rather a reasonably priced place a family could eat at, without having to brave the crowds of Times Square to find a restaurant every night. Also good is the touch-screen check-in (because they only seemed to have a few staff at the actual desk).

My husband and I have stayed at a number of Hyatt hotels around the world, and will continue to do so. The newest offering in Manhattan from this reputable chain, is the Hyatt Times Square. Now, there are many Hyatts in and around Manhattan, and they are all good, but if you're a tourist and you want a centralized location, with easy access to Broadway and shopping, you can't do any better than this small and chic hotel.The hotel restaurant, t45, was designed by George Wong, and conjures up images of an old timey, retro diner. The food was very good and the service excellent. There is also a rootop lounge, bar 54, but unfortunately it was so crowded, we couldn't get in. We'll just have to go back another time.The room was a reasonable size, especially for New York City, where size is always at a premium. Sleek and modern, with minimalist decor, it suited us very nicely. The bathroom, although small, matched the bedroom in its modern decor, and always comes with standard amenities.We've stayed numerous times at the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central Station, which is enormous by comparison, and has a lot to offer, but for sheer convenience, the Hyatt Times Square can't be topped. One final note: We stayed at this Hyatt using our free night offered by our Hyatt credit card. It was an excellent way for us to check it out and decide whether we would consider going back. We did love it and will definitely be back.","Boston, Massachusetts",27,4.0

Having been a guest at Hyatt 48 Lex and the Hyatt Grand Central previously, I looked forward to experiencing this new Hyatt property. It proved to be the best of the three.Hyatt Times Square is an ideal choice for anyone who wants to be in the center of the Midtown tourist areas of NYC. The 45th Street location is very close to the hubbub of Times Square, and yet it offers rooms that can be surprisingly quiet. Normally a light sleeper, I stayed in an executive suite on the 10th floor. There were no big-time issues with traffic noise. If you can't sleep with any noise, try using Sleep Pillow or another noise-cancelling app on your smart phone.The place has a boutique feel, but the rooms are not glorified shoe boxes. They're comfy and well appointed. The hotel's small check-in desk is located immediately inside the entrance, staffed by energetic Hyatt employees who quite simply can't do enough for you. Need something? Just ask. A special shout-out to Floyd, who helped me several times during the stay. There is also a small restaurant called T45 in the lobby area. The food is OK. T45 will do room service for a fee, but you're usually better off just going down to the lobby and bringing the fare up to your room. I was particularly impressed by James in T45. He was cordial, quick in service, and very welcoming at the bar. Again, the overall theme of quality customer service was evident. I didn't get to the rooftop bar, but I understand that the view up there is spectacular.Room highlights from this executive suite:Mini refrig (not stocked - bring your own goodies - temperature varies)Rain shower (terrific)Plenty of outletsLight controls can be a little confusing, but they are clearly marked. Just keep pushing the buttons until you get used to them.Night light setting in the bathroom (a plus)Comfy sofa bed and ample desk in the living areaTiny ice buckets . . . a minor annoyanceClean, efficient room designNo pay-per-view movies are offered. Why??Great flat screen LGs in both bedroom and living areaSeparate bedroom in these suites offers privacy,Bed is very comfortable, and closet space is ample.(The rest of the room details are available on the hotel website.)There are several decent restaurants within a block of the hotel. I enjoyed lunch at Connolly's, a casual Irish bar and restaurant a few doors down, and the steakhouse across the street (Bobby Van's?? Can't recall the name, but I definitely recall the tasty filet).Bottom line:This hotel is new and welcoming and terrific. The location is also ideal for any tourists who want to explore Midtown. Recommended for couples, solo travelers or small family tourism (up to 2 kids).P.S. If you ever use hotel-arranged cars for private transportation to the airport, please read this section:The rates charged by this hotel's normal outside contractor for airport transportation by town car or limo are ludicrous. I was quoted $179 for a trip to Newark airport in a town car. Having lived in the NYC area for decades, I knew the price was out of line. I immediately mentioned that to the concierge and proceeded to find my own alternative. A simple search on my smart phone yielded a $109 rate from another vendor, and that option was the better choice. I rode to Newark with a smile.",New York,60,5.0

The rooftop bar was a nice treat, but I would recommend heading up there to enjoy the view and buy drinks elsewhere as the cost is extremely pricey. You are paying for the view, which is understandable.But when I think of other NYC hotels, the Hyatt Andaz 5th Ave far exceeds this hotel. So unless you get a real good price for the room, I would visit the Andaz before this property. Overall, very good, but the Andaz is much preferred.","Burton, South Carolina",114,4.0

The rooms are big and comfortable. It's plenty of space and You'll also find a wardrobe for Your clothes and bags. Complimentary water and coffee is provided everyday. Shower is so big, that i assume, 4 people taking shower at the same time wouldn't be a problem:-) If You prefer to take a very cold showers, it may be a problem, because it's almost impossible to set the water to ""only cold"". Service is very good and staff is exceptionally kind and helpful. About cleanliness - rooms are cleaned on daily basis of course - however when we moved sitting sofa, we found a pack of unopened condoms! For us, it was just a reason to big laugh, but if more demanding customers will find such a ""surprises"" I am pretty sure that the management will hear about it in not very pleasant way. From our side - no complaints about that, but try to move furniture a little bit more while cleaning the rooms. This hotel has also a roof bar with stunning view over south Manhattan. I can't write more about menu or prices, because I simply had no time to sit there and enjoy a drink. I just went there to see the bar and view. Can't say more about hotels restaurant either, because I wasn't eating there this time. Location of the hotel is perfect! Just few steps from Times Square,Broadway theaters, subway, shopping etc. Highly recommend this location especially for first-time visitors to NYC. One thing about the rooms. Rooms with a view are situated above 25th floor. They will cost You slightly extra than rooms without view (from first to 25th floor i assume) but it's worth it!!! Elevators are pretty quick and not even once, during our stay, I've experienced any longer waiting times. Bathrobes are not standard in all rooms, however if You need one and ask for it at the reception, You'll probably get it delivered to your room, free of charge.I'll definitely check this hotel as my primary choice during my next trip to Big Apple.

One woman was trying to use her iPad, Mac, iPhone and Blackberry all at the same time it seemed. Internet access should be free nowadays considering the room rates. Yes I know it's so they can rip off the business travellers on expenses, but it's still something that should be provided for free nowadays.Great location for the theatre.

The staff at the front desk, no matter how busy, are very courteous and do not make you feel rushed. When entering the building I was always greeted by someone with a genuine smile on their face. The concierge was very patient and informed. The one person that really stood out was one of the doormen. He overheard me outside speaking with my friends trying to find a nice place to hang out.

The rooms were all newly and tastefully renovated. (We actually chose the hyatt over the hilton because of this.)4. The humidifier that one could get on loan on request.

We had flown a long way (24 hours) and were extremely jet lagged. The could-be-better:1. We are frequent business travelers and always wonder why many hotels in the US don't provide bedroom slippers as readily as Asia hotels. We were relieved to read on this thread that Hyatt Times Square could provide on request, hence we did not pack ours. Alas when we were there, the hotel had run out of them. The housekeeper was very nice to explain in a handwritten card that she wasn't able to get any, after our request for two consecutive days. Blame it on our fussy feet, but it was a small mark against our otherwise, generally positive experience.2. There is no swimming pool (which is fine), but it also meant there was no ""shared"" shower facility. We had checked out at noon but our flight was not till 9pm. It meant we weren't able to take a shower before our flight. I suppose we could have asked if we were able to use the spa's shower facilities, but we decided to take our shower when we reached Germany instead.Now the important question - will we return again?

There's a lovely scent as you walk into the reception area which is a great touch and all the staff were friendly and happy.Issue we had was with the lifts! There's only 3 if you're staying on higher floors and you end up waiting AGES and there's always queues there near reception. Once you're in the lift it seems to bypass some floors, even though you've pressed the button and stops at ones that no one's waiting at. It really was a joke - we had a group in the lift with us that wanted the roof terrace. They came from the ground floor, stopped at our floor (39th), then another floor with no one waiting, then stopped at a floor just below the roof terrace and it came back down to the ground floor again ! Weird - but really needs addressing by hotel as obviously you can't walk up the stairs ! Hate to think what would happen in an emergency though which should be a concern for the hotel.Rooms were decorated really well, with an inspirational quote in frame on the wall instead of random paintings you usually find. The ceiling pressure shower really makes a difference and you feel so refreshed after some dribbly showers I've had in other hotels! Flat tv screen was good too, though guess that's a standard in most places now. Breakfast in the hotel was a little pricy but really tasty and massive portions as you'd expect in the US.Location was amazing - just a few steps from all the action. Irish pubs either side of the hotel if you're after a quick drink or bite to eat and of course you're at Times Square so you're spolit for choice anyway.

Room average size as NYC rooms go. Major drawback were the elevators. Club on the hotel roof draws people who aren't staying in the hotel. Club shares the same elevators as guests. Elevators were sometimes overloaded and the hotel did a poor job at managing the flow of people. Very disconcerting having the elevator stall and open between floors. The Hotel Gansevoort and The Standard Hotel manage this process much better.

Location fantastic, a minute's stroll from Times Square. No room service delivery which is a shame. You can order food from their diner downstairs and collect it for takeaway, but I found the choices to all be quite heavy - they could do with expanding the menu to include more snacks. Breakfast for two at the diner including two main dishes, two coffees and two juices was around $70. Rooftop bar is a massive selling point - stunning views of the city and tasty cocktails! The reception area is quite small, which is a shame as I like big, shiny, bustling reception areas in urban hotels.

The prices were on the high side on average, but offered reasonable value compared to other offerings.First impressions of the hotel was good, but I think there can be more done to improve the experience.Good points:Great location for many of the commonplace sights. The rooms were spacious and the facilities all reasonably well thought out. Had a good drink at the rooftop bar but it can get quite busy. The bedding was comfortable and clean, and a good selection of amenities were provided (although my mini-bar was not stocked (not a problem for me at all)).Feedback points for consideration:As many have alluded, for the price one pays for the rooms, I think it is not good value to have to pay for in-room internet. Anyone who stays in the hotel will only realistically be using the internet to check emails in the morning, and to do light surfing at night. It represents tremendously poor value for the light amount of internet traffic and strongly urge the management to reconsider. Maybe a ""lite"" package for US$5 might be considered more reasonable.Given the large number of walk-in customers to the sky bar, it may perhaps be a more efficient (and secure) proposition to have one dedicated lift to the sky bar which does not stop on guest floors. For guests who wish to access the sky bar, I'm sure the key cards can be programmed to provide access.Unfortunately I also encountered the fire alarm issue one of the reviewers alluded to which resulted in a very poor night's sleep. Issue raised and service recovery initiated, so I will consider the issue resolved satisfactorily, but I do hope that the staff members will be able to take some training points from the issue about how to manage the alarm system. It's there for genuine emergencies and guests will be grateful, but 4-5 false alarms a night might prove a bit too much...Work on these and perhaps this might become the leading Hyatt property in central NYC.",London,6,4.0

Room was clean and modern with slightly quirky décor, which was a nice touch and gave it a slightly premium feel. Bathroom was also a really generous size with a good layout. On a trivial note the bathroom products were all really nice and there's a list of extra items the hotel offers such as slippers/toothpaste etc that you can ask for at no cost or borrow, which is a real help if you've forgotten anything. Hotel staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful. The location was ideal as you're right off Times Square (literally round the corner), so easy access to tourist hotspots but had absolutely no trouble with any noise, which I think you might find if you were staying on Times Sq. We had both dinner and breakfast at the T45 diner which I really liked (I would recommend the steak). We also tried out the rooftop bar for afternoon drinks, cocktails were slightly overpriced, staff here were slow and not overly attentive, but the view alone was worth it. The only slight downside was that you have to pay for wifi in your room, which I think is getting uncommon in this day and age, but free wifi is available in the lobby if you don't mind squashing up on the usually busy seating area, or you could eat in the diner and access it more comfortably.

Well done to the receptionist who made us feel so special and welcome when we arrived. Lovely hotel.,"London, United Kingdom",63,4.0

Upon checkin were greated with a pleasant young woman named Karen who after learning of our bday celebration upgraded us to a suite on 46th floor. Beautiful newly renovated room with wonderful amenities to included heated floors in the bathroom and a large shower. The lobby area is nice with staff eager to please the guests. There is a rooftop bar with a beautiful view and again very friendly staff. We also returned to our room the first night to a bottle of champagne and a birthday card signed by many of the staff.I would highly recommend this hotel...staff and newly renovated (completed Dec 2013).There is no negative to the hotel but it is in a busy touristy area so if crowds don't bother you this is your place. Also as this is in the theatre district it may be difficult to get a taxi and traffic is bad around 8 so plan accordingly.,"Annapolis, Maryland",4,4.0

I usually stay at The Grand but figured I would give it a chance. Considering how ridiculously expensive it is to stay in NYC period I feel I should always try and get my money's worth. The Hyatt Times Square made me feel like my money was worthless. The decor is so bland through out the entire hotel. No towels in my room, hair all over the bath room floor and my room did not come with a ""view"" as advertised. The diner had to be by far the worst culinary experience I've encountered in NY. The breakfast was not good at all. Not only were my potatoes cold but over cooked!! And what kind of diner doesn't carry A1 sauce?! I ordered a steak for dinner and was disappointed that something so simple like A1 sauce was not available. Overall, never again Hyatt Times Square, I shall stick to what I know with the grand.

I upgraded at my expense to a suite since I was due to stay for 10 nights. The new room on the 48th floor looked promising at first glance with a much improved bathroom and shower, larger space and 2 large televisions to keep me entertained.On the first evening the air-conditioning started playing up bringing the room to a sweltering 100 degree despite having been set to 70. The next morning I brought this to the attention of the staff who said they would get facilities to look into it. 6 nights later and it still has a mind of its own even when I switch it off.On the second night I ordered room service from the T45 restaurant, promoted in the room through a lamented menu. To my surprise this functions as a separate entity and the 'bag' my food came in could have better been supplied by a dedicated delivery franchise. There is no evidence of any formal affiliation, no plates, no condiments and the cutlery (metal at least) were still in my room 3 days later!I had my laundry done after the 3rd day, good service and reasonably priced but no replacement bags or paperwork so if I want to use the service again, as I do, I need to especially request this. Odd since this is an income stream and shouldn't be linked to turning the rooms over.The televisions have a convenient portal to connect your iPad or computer to view your own content but despite my technical experience and reading all the available documentation (none) I could not get this to work on any of my devices nor either of the displays.Last night we had a fire alarm go off at 3am. A loud announcement was made about 10 minutes in to inform us that it was a false alarm and not to evacuate the building. Problem was that this went on for another hour with repeated loud announcements.This morning I closed the bathroom door form the outside and found myself locked out having to jiggle the handle many times to get into my own bathroom!I'm starting to think I'm on candid camera since there are far too many incident for this to be a coincidence! I know this is a new hotel but having stayed on 3 separate occasions, I can vouch that its getting worse each and every time. This is likely to be my last stay here despite holding a high status on the Hyatt loyalty scheme. I will stick to the Hilton or boutique hotels from now when in NY.The staff have heard my issues and come across all apologetic but all the issue are still there.","Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",26,1.0

However, what impressed us the most was the kindness, hospitality, attention to detail, and the incredible helpfulness offered to us by the staff. From the moment we checked in, until we departed, there was not a single staff member that was anything less than accomodating. Even if the amenities would have been less than adequate (which they were not in the least bit) I would have easily been able to overlook any downfalls due to the personnel that took care of us.

Initially on a shortlist of hotels for our trip, a great offer from hotels.com made selection easy - though we didn't plan on staying so close to Times Sq.We were made to feel very welcome on arrival and check-in was performed quickly and professionally. The staff, it has to be said, were all very friendly and efficient throughout our whole stay. We'd upgraded to a double-queen 'view' room. The room on the 30th floor was at the rear of the building and whilst it had a 'view' it wasn't really of anything - just some tall buildings. Didn't feel it necessary to complain, but I have a feeling some may have.The room was large by NY standards, tastefully decorated and the bathroom very contemporary. Everywhere was spotless and the beds very comfortable. As with most reviewers, it took a while to get to grips with the lighting - but pretty straightforward really. The only negative with the room was lack of storage (for a family of three with three suitcases). There appears to be lots of drawer space - one bank of three turns out to be the fridge (nice to have though) - another a safe and coffee making facility. Other drawers in the bedside cabinets are there for show only and don't open (can't really see the point of that one). So that leaves you with three small drawers - though there is plenty storage (shelving) in the bathroom though so that helps a bit. The media charging point is a great feature and certainly cut out the usual charging clutter you usually have dotted around the room.We were surprised by how quiet the room was (from 30th floor). Heard nothing from the outside all stay - in fact can't say I remember hearing anybody along the corridors either - so it was all very peaceful and relaxing.We used the Diner a couple of times for breakfast and enjoyed it. You may well be able to get cheaper around the area, but for convenience you can't really go wrong.Whether you think the hotel is in a great location depends on whether you want to stay by Times Sq or not. If you do, there can't be any better. It's not right in the middle - just a block to the side - which means you don't get trampled by the crowds every time you step out.So, to conclude, if you want a hotel by Times Sq - this comes highly recommended.","Halifax, United Kingdom",38,5.0

What a shame it didn't deliver the room with a view of Times Square which I had paid a supplement for. If they had done it would be five star however it didn't seem good value for money.The first room we were given was on 20th floor and was quite noisy from the fans on top of adjacent buildings, it did not have a view of Times Square or the city. We were given a room on 45th floor and had high hopes but sadly it was at the rear of the building so although quieter still had no view. I guess we could have tried again but it took ages waiting for lifts (there are not enough of them and they're often crowded) and lugging luggage around and after 10 hours travelling we couldn't be bothered.Aside from not getting the room we paid for this is a lovely hotel in a really good part of town, just steps from Times Square. The only other slightly annoying aspects were the fact you had to ask for everything. We had no shampoo or shower gel in our room on arrival and were given one tube of each (between 3) when we asked. You also had to ask for robes, slippers, tea and a kettle. Such a shame this could be a number one rated hotel with just a little more attention to guests needs.","London, United Kingdom",55,3.0

Its the few cons that have stopped me giving this hotel a 5 rating.The management need to seriously reconsider offering free wifi only in lobby because it is clear all guests need it but are unwilling to pay the fee to have it in the room.

The suite had a bedroom and living room, and a big bathroom. I loved that the windows opened a little (not enough to scare my daughter, who was a little afraid of being so high up), but enough to feel the weather and get some fresh air. Outside noise from Times Square was not a problem at all. There were plush robes and slippers in the closet, and all the amenities you'd expect in the bathroom and for coffee. The employees are all extremely friendly and helpful. The front desk girl, the doormen, the waitress in the restaurant, the housekeeper... everyone was chatty, smiling and asked if we needed any help with anything. The location couldn't be better. Just a few steps from the craziness of Times Square, but on a quiet street. We ordered breakfast from the restaurant attached to the lobby. It came quickly, was delicious, and was not overly expensive (which is often the case with room service breakfasts). It wasn't on a rolling cart, but in a to-go bag and containers, which was honestly just fine. I'd rather it this way and pay the reasonable prices then have an overpriced breakfast on a cart. We were so impressed by this hotel, we already booked our next stay. The only thing I'd ask the management to consider, is to somehow allow families to use the rooftop area (it's a bar, so you have to be 21).

We stopped into the spa to see what the amenities were there and asked if there was a sauna, were told there wasn't but there were his/her steam rooms. We said we'd be back to check them out. When we returned just a bit later, the Spa ladies had already pre-started the steam rooms for us, got us into our robes and slippers and we each had a relaxing steam and shower with some great spa soaps and lotions, tons of soft, fluffy towels - was such a nice way to relax and catch a nap before heading out for a show. When we returned after our show, we headed up to Bar 54. Wow again for the staff!

Last minute we decided to have a look online at other hotels. We came across the Hyatt and actually saved money on what turned out to be much nicer, with a bigger room and you were on Times Sq on turning the corner out of the hotel!We arrived quite late and were immediately greeted by friendly and attentive staff. On checking in we were upgraded to a room with a view of Times Sq on the 31st floor. The room was clean and comfortable, with nice touches like complimentary water and a coffee machine (although missing Tea, which was available upon request) dressing gowns and slippers and a small fridge. There was even an entertainment dock with various ports including USB, AV, iPod etc. If you felt there was something missing from the room then there was an extensive list of extras you could have delivered to your room at no extra cost, and for anything you may have forgotten there was a list of things you could borrow, or pay for if you took them with you when you left (i.e. hair straighteners, adaptors for plugs etc.) The only downsides to the room was that there was no milk for your hot drinks, just powdered creamer, and if you wanted a bath you were out of look as the room only had a shower. However this posed no problem for myself as I prefer a shower - and the shower was actually amazing! There's no room service either, but being in Times Sq that's not really a massive problem. There are also ice machines on each floor, conveniently for us pretty much outside our door!We also ate in the diner T45 a couple of times for breakfast, it wasn't cheap, but neither was it very expensive compared to other places to eat in the city. The food was pretty good and the staff very polite. We went up to the bar one night on the 54th floor, an amazing view but VERY expensive for what you got. I've been to plenty of high end cocktail bars and this was very overpriced even compared to many other bars in NYC. I'd recommend it at least once for the view though!All in all this was good value for money considering how expensive hotels can be in NY, I'm so glad we changed hotel last minute after we saw the hotel we originally intended to stay in (some friends still stayed there.) It saved us $500, and the location was much better. I can't really say anything bad about the hotel, it was clean, it was comfortable and the staff were amazing - no request was a problem and it was dealt with quickly and politely. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, and next time we visit New York it will certainly be the first place we look for a room!","Manchester, United Kingdom",0,5.0

The problem here is that there are major flaws with the rooms. I arrived on a Thursday Afternoon after a day of meetings and was promptly checked in with no issues. I found it odd that as a Platinum Hyatt Member, I was given a room with no view and no amenities on the 8th floor despite overhearing that there were numerous available rooms to upgrade to with views that had gone unsold. I was in no mood to whine and moan at that point so up the elevator I went. The room was nicely appointed and average sized for midtown. Now wanting to go grab a drink and a snack, I figured I would venture up to Bar 54 for a great hotel bar experience. The problem is that my set of elevators meant I had to return to the lobby and then wait in line again with a new group to head up to the higher floors. The lounge is beautiful but don't expect to find a large bar area for single travelers. Unfortunately the 6 seats at the bar were full so I ventured back down the 54 floors to the lobby and back in line for the elevators back to my floor. When I was in my room, I could not set my thermostat as it kept cycling through some sort of electronic reset and my lights decided to randomly shut off as I tried to do work, as if they were on a timer. The fun part was when I sat on the toilet and the lights went out in the bathroom and I had to navigate my way in the dark with my pants around my ankles (thankfully I didn't get that drink yet).I was so furious, I decided to leave but the manager on call helped out with an ""upgrade"" to a higher floor. He was very nice and accommodating and saved my experience to that point. Upon relocating, I continued my work and went out to dinner with no issues. When I returned, I noticed some water present in the shower area but I thought maybe it was left from the housekeeper earlier in the day. In the middle of the night, as I slept, I was awoken to the shower leaking water profusely to the point I thought somebody broke in to use my shower. Although it scared the hell out of me, I was relieved to see it was again just another miscue in a new hotel. All in all, I won't be back unless there is some amazing deal that is made available during one of my monthly trips to NYC. For anyone else, proceed with caution. ","Boston, MA",18,2.0

Hotel bedding was comfortable and luxurious. Loved the rainhead shower and its modern look. Small refrigerator was a must for us and we used it daily. The gym was nice with free weights and cardio machines. There is also a very nice bar on the top floor which has great views though it was a bit windy and chilly in April. One negative was that the wifi was not free except in the lobby, so every morning the cheapskates were huddled in the lobby taking up all the lounge space. There is a small restaurant on the ground floor which serves beer and wine.

The lobby is small but nice, and they understood we were in a hurry to check in because our flight had been delayed. Everyone we met who worked there was friendly and helpful. Our room was, indeed, very small. But this didn't strike me as odd given that it is NYC and real estate is expensive. The room was really nice - clean, comfortable bedding, very nice new bathroom - and Quiet. How on earth they made this room right in the heart of Times Square so quiet is beyond me, but it was great. Didn't even hear any hallway noise. The cons: if you are looking for a larger room (and yes, having more than two bags would have made things a bit tight) this probably isn't the place for you; when I got back from dinner on our first night I was surprised to find that there was no mini-bar. This really wasn't a problem; I had been looking forward to a glass of wine in the room after a sort of rough travel day, but instead just went to bed.

They were fabulous, especially Brittany who was extremely helpful. We booked an Executive Suite, and could hardly believe that it was indeed an executive suite. It was the size of a postage stamp. (Would hate to see a junior suite.!). We were a party of 3 and if the sofa bed was pulled out, we had to drag the chair and table down the short hallway to the front door in order to have access to the bathroom. The decor seemed to have been done by IKEA, with vinyl-covered sofa and an uncomfortable chair. The so-called amenities did not include robes as advertised on their website, and pretty much were what you would expect from a Motel 6 - shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. There was a long list of amenities that you could request, but if you get out of the shower and want a q-tip, do you really want to wait around for someone to deliver it to your room? The hotel decor is, overall, super contemporary so if that's your style, go for it. We went to the bar on the 54th floor and the view was very cool but the never-ending song (really, NEVER ending) with pulsating vibes sent us to the elevator. My companions and I have stayed at more than 100 Hyatts over the years and this one degrades the brand. The only thing going for it is location and the front office staff. We let them know he first day that there were 3 of us, but still had to call down each day to get a 3rd glass, not to mention that after the first day, they left 5 decaf coffees and no regular coffee, and never more than one small bottle of water. No mini-bar either. Pathetic of a Hyatt.","Austin, TX",19,2.0

We rang on various occasions for toiletries, towels, bath robs etc, but they seldom came within 30 minutes. A shame really, hence the headline of this review that the hotel is better on the door when you come in than it is once you've got to your floor. Perhaps we just tended to ring at the wrong moment each time. The food and beverage offer isn't your traditional hotel arrangement. There's a bistro in the lobby which is quite expensive and doesn't have the kind of breakfast offer I'd usually go for. Happily, Starbucks across the street does, though, so no real issue.

The price compared to other hotels in the area seemed to be a much better value, but I suspect as the hotel gains in popularity, rates might creep up a bit. So many hotel choices in the area, but this was a particularly good one.","Las Vegas, Nevada",894,4.0

You can tell it’s a brand new hotel with the décor and design of the lobby area and rooms. I really didn’t get to enjoy the spa and lounge upstairs because I was walking around Time Square most of the time. It is really close to all the Broadway shows and shops like Forever 21, H&M, American Eagle, M&M Store and Express etc. There is also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel, the Starbucks is pretty small but it does have a seating area compared to the other ones in the Times Square area that don’t have a seating area for you at all. I was a little disappointed that the hotel didn’t have a 24HR dining or kitchen area. However, there is a 24HR Deli/Café that is right down the street from the hotel it has a good selection of food and drinks. Also, I felt the dining area in the hotel was a little over priced for eggs and bacon, but there is a restaurant called Junior’s that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner they also have amazing food. I didn’t see any trains stations close by the area, but then again I wasn’t looking too hard. When you walk out from the hotel there is always somebody there ready to get you to a taxi to take you to your next destination. We did have a problem with are room not putting out any heat, when we informed them about this they sent somebody up to our room to look at it. That’s when he informed use that it would take a while for him to figure out what was wrong with it. When he went downstairs to inform the manager about our room situation she called use and told use she would be upgrading are room to one with a terrace. That room was huge and the terrace was also big, it also had a better view of Time Square. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to all of our needs. P.S.

While I am loyal to certain hotels, I always check a site like Orbitz for a good deal. I knew for this trip that we'd be going to the theatre, so I centered my search in Times Square. I saw a great offer for the new Hyatt Times Square and decided to give it a try. When I checked in I enquired about a bath and the room I booked didn't have one. After just being in the hospital for two weeks, I really wanted a bathtub. The front desk manager was able to give me a deluxe room on the 45th floor for $25 a night more. It's the best money I've ever spent. Room 4509 is beautiful! It has a walk in shower as well as a beautiful bathtub, which ended up being a life saver. There is a little fridge and two closets. I don't want to leave! The floor to ceiling windows offer not only a great view, but lots of natural light. Our flight was canceled today so I had to extend my stay (darn). The rack rate was more than twice what I originally paid, but after speaking with the desk manager, they were able to offer me the room for the same price that I paid the prior three nights. I have met anyone who works here who hasn't been incredibly friendly and helpful. I love everything about it. I even made not of the the model of the hairdryer-I'm going to buy one when I get home. If I had any complaints, it would be the room service food. My adult children were coming back to watch the Oscars with me last night and we got held up and weren't going to get back to the room until 9:00. We decided to order room service. They were very friendly and it was prompt, but the food was not great. They got one of the entrees wrong but were very apologetic and sent up a new one in 15 minutes. It sucks to spend $100 on a meal that you don't really eat, but I can forgive this one thing. I don't come to the city to eat in my hotel.

The hotel appears relatively new and boast light switches that control light throughout the room and bathroom. One can even choose mood lighting or a night light. A nice touch. The hotel offers a long kist of things it will provide without cost during one's stay--including phone and laptop chargers, a rarity in my experience.Service was excellent. The person who checked me in walked me to the elevator and assured herself I had no question. My room was sufficiently large and comfortable with king sized bed, a comfortable chair and a desk with chair. The quality of soap, shampoo, etc. was a cut above many other hotels. One curious thing was the absence of drawers in which to pack clothing, etc. It was a minor matter and I easily set my suitcase on one of the standard stands found in hotels everywhere.The hotel offers a 24 hour gym and an adjacent restaurant.In short, it was a great stay. Prices in New York at the moment are somewhat lower than at other times of the year, so I enjoyed the Hyatt for would I would usually expect to pay at a much lower quality facility.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",77,5.0

I stayed for 5 days for a little work but mostly play.The room was well proportioned and large by New York standards. The decor was smart, fresh and modern and added to the feel that this is a luxury hotel. I loved the window chair, although ended up turning it around so I could enjoy the Times Square view. The bed was incredibly comfortable. I was battling a bad chest infection when I arrived which had me spend more time in my room than I would normally. This is a room you can really feel comfortable just hanging out in. The bathroom was awesome - clean and spacious. I particularly loved the shower with the choice of waterfall and hand held shower head.A big plus in my opinion is the small quiet fridge in the room. These are a rarity for NYC hotels which for the most part have packed minibars or no refrigeration options. This is great for a longer stay in New York to be able to bring food and drinks back or have a juice and yoghurt as an easy breakfast in the morning.The staff were exemplary. Every experience I had was positive. From the doormen, the front desk, the elevator man, housekeeping, bellhop and maintenance - everyone was genuinely welcoming and friendly. I shared an elevator with a member of the maintenance staff who was keen to know how my stay was and offered that I could ask for her personally if there was any issues with my room. The Hyatt staff are to to be commended for their professionalism as it added to my overall experience that this was a special visit.The hotel restaurant (with diner atmospherics) has now opened. I ate a late lunch here the day I arrived (in a snow storm). It was fine, although the hamburger was small and definitely on the pricey side even for Times Square. It does however have a good selection and is a convenient option.There is a quasi business center option - a row of computers off the lobby. Printing boarding passes are free and up to 15 minutes and black and white printing is free (handy when I needed to print out tickets, an itinerary and a receipt).I found a great pre-paid deal that made the week very affordable. Their standard rates are a little higher, but I still think it equates to being very good value, particularly compared to other equally priced hotels I have stayed at in New York over the years.It has been a few years since I have stayed at Times Square, as I usually stay near Wall Street for work or Soho or Upper West side for play. The advantage of the Hyatt is that it is just off Times Square on 45th Street, so you are a little away from the craziness, but also just steps to the craziness, so pros both ways depending on what you are looking for. When I needed a new suitcase at 1.30am on a Friday, only in Times Square will you find stores open until 2am and 24 hour options to be able to pick up a suitcase. It is also very convenient to a variety of subway options. It is also an easy walk to 5th Avenue and Rockefeller Centre, and walkable south to Empire State Building and Herald Square or north to Central Park and Lincoln Centre. And, of course, very convenient to Broadway's shows.I did a lot of research to choose a hotel for this trip, and can say that my time at the Hyatt lived up to everything I had hoped for.","Sydney, Australia",37,5.0

The King bed was comfortable, but the 7-week old Queen sofa bed was like any other sofa bed: lumpy and springy, therefore uncomfortable.

I booked my stay at the Hyatt Times Square literally at the last minute last week. Tuesday night (the 4th) the weather was forecast to be miserable overnight. I had early morning meetings in Manhattan on Wednesday morning so at 9 p.m. I booked a room at the Hyatt. I got to the hotel at 11 p.m. and was greeted pleasantly and promptly by the folks at the front desk. My room on the 38th floor was a good size for a New York hotel room and was furnished simply and tastefully. The bathroom was also a good size and very modern. Overnight I couldn't hear a peep from Times Square - and woke up to the promised sleet and freezing rain. The one thing I had forgotten to pack was my umbrella so I prepared myself for a seven block walk in the rain. When I checked out both the staff at reception and the doorman insisted I take an umbrella, and I am so glad I did. The weather was miserable and I can't even imagine how much worse it would have been without that protection.Thursday morning I realized I had left my perfume in the hotel room so I called the hotel and the person with whom I spoke was great - asked my name and pertinent details of my stay. The housekeeper had turned in my perfume to the lost and found and they had made a note in my reservation - including what type of perfume it was. She couldn't have been any nicer and put my perfume at the front desk for me to pick up. When I went to pick up my perfume I also took the chance to return the much appreciated umbrella. They even checked my ID for me to pick up my perfume - which I really appreciated - wouldn't you hate to leave something behind and have someone else end up with it?So long story short - if I ever need to stay in Manhattan again this is the place for me.","ramsey, nj",9,5.0

It should be said that all rooms are above the 23rd floor which means that you get to be in the belly of the beast and yet sleep soundly. Very new hotel with a boutique feel and small tastefully decorated lobby. The hotel is only open a few weeks old so the roof top lounge and a few other features still are not open. We were the first to stay at the Premier Suite given to us, which was pretty cool.The Bedroom, Nice Large Comfy Bed. Loved the white comforter that they change between visitors, no germs bedspread. Slightly odd ornamentation above the bed which included a small porcelain figure that looked like a balloon animal !!!The Hotel offers Great amenities in case one needs it, its the small touches that makes a 5 Star experience. The bathroom had a heated floor, which you could adjust. Bathroom had a rain style shower. Cool lighting options. Overall the room design was great. Suite features a private terrace, soundproofed floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook the Times Square area, one king bed and a 47-inch flat-screen TV. The sleek, residential vibe includes a spacious living and dining area, plus an eclectic collection of New York City-themed artwork complemented by a backdrop of neutral, light-toned fabrics and warm woods. The suite features a modern master bathroom with rain shower and separate soaking tub.The Negatives would be: The TV is using IP and freezes up constantly which became annoying while watching Morning news. The Toilet in the bathroom was not functioning well, required at least 3-4 flushes and had a odd odor coming from it.","New York City, New York",385,4.0

The location of the hotel is great if you want to be near Times Square and the Broadway shows. It's also a reasonable walk to most midtown locations. The hotel is new, so the facilities are clean and in good shape. The staff was very friendly and professional. The rooms were functional, the bed comfortable, and the shower nice. Those are the positives. As for the negatives, the room service is below par. They deliver food in brown paper bags with plastic utensils and cups -- as if you were just ordering take out. The restaurant in the hotel is overpriced and underwhelming. I think it's supposed to be an upscale diner, but the food is average, the selections limited, and the waiters are made to wear awful uniforms. The décor of the hotel rooms and hallways reminds me of the things I don't like about 70's style. The rooms are fairly basic and bland. If you're looking for a special place to stay, this is not it. If all you expect is a comfortable bed and good location, it's a fine option if the price is right.","San Clemente, CA",72,3.0

We had considered many options and happened upon a good deal for this hotel. We do not regret our choice. The room was good size, the bed was comfy, there was no problem with noise. We had a nice view of Times Square. We were put on the 32nd floor in room 3202. We were greeted warmly upon arrival, the concierge provided excellent directions to Penn Station including what subway lines to use to get to and from Penn. The doormen were excellent. T45 (on site restaurant) offered up tasty burgers and fries as well as a delicious chocolate banana shake. Was a little on the pricy side but we were visiting New York and using the hotel restaurant, it was what I expected. Justin, our waiter, was extremely helpful on both occasions we used the restaurant and T45 is very lucky to have him on staff. The comment about the elevators going to specific floors is spot on but, once used to it, it wasn't a problem. Our only disappointment was that the rooftop bar wasn't yet open.

Outstanding service. Check in was efficient, very smart staff there. Express elevators to the 34th floor (what a view!). Hallway signage was like the flipping number/letters at Grand Central, very cool. Room was contemporary and just my style. Very cool lighting pre-sets like 'mood light' or 'night light'. Shower?

The rooms are decent size for NYC and very clean and well appointed. I enjoyed my TV welcoming to my room with my name on it. Nice touch. The hotel is simple and it makes getting around it quite easy. No major lobby to mention, which means no globs of tourists loitering. Check-in was quick and easy with no wait. Elevators are probably the fastest I have been in while in NY - including most office buildings. This is a huge plus when trying to get down to get to a meeting. I had a King room with a 40 inch or so TV, desk, and lounge chair. The floors are small. Maybe 10 or so rooms on my floor. It was very quiet and did not hear any noise from either inside or outside. It was a pleasant stay and a much needed break from the craziness of the overly touristy hotels and the conference hotels. This is a perfect fit for the business traveler who must be in this area of NYC. It would also be great for couple who want a quiet get away and want to be near TSQ.

According to their website, there are only 11 rooms on each floor. Not sure how many rooms they have altogether, but the check-in area is too small and too standard. I am surprised that the refrigerator in the room is empty. The lounge at the top of the building is not yet opened. The staff told me it is expected to be opened next week.

Check in was a breeze with the bar code scanning machine and the front desk staff immediately answered all of our questions.Stayed in room 702 - I was worried we were so low it would be noisy but it wasn't. I did hear a few sirens - but it's NYC! The room had 2 queen beds that were enveloped in white - duvet, sheets and pillows. How nice! Love that crisp clean look. There were ample outlets available at desk level and even a power strip built into the desk. An amenity list was available for items you forgot - we did need a few. What we requested was promptly delivered with a smile. (extra towels, shampoo, mouthwash etc). My only complaint was the lights....good concept - difficult execution. For the life of me I could not figure our how to keep just one bedside light on for reading!The bathroom was very nicely done - hooks to hang up towels, plenty of counter space, large, clean and spacious shower. I love that the shower had a small ledge for propping up your leg when shaving! It was a small space, but well designed. We left the next morning after a quick breakfast in the room. I made a run to the deli a few doors up and came back with a feast for a great price. Starbucks is across the street.All in all an excellent visit. You know how sometimes you stay in a hotel and think - Man this wasn't worth the cost...well this one was!

It is a brand new hotel and everything was sparkling. The room was compact, but everything was there, slippers, robes and a perfect bed. The bathroom had every amenity and facility.

In the past, Times Square was never my location of choice due to the noise and general craziness, but after reading about the new building with sound-proof windows, and being a longtime fan of Hyatt, I decided to give it a try (the opening introductory price on Hyatt.com helped persuade me). Its atmosphere is similar to the Andaz Wall Street. They upgraded us to a View King on the 29thfloor due to my platinum status. The room had very modern décor, with NYC-themed pop art. We enjoyed all the modern amenities: super comfortable top-of-the-line Hyatt bed (not like the ones at the Hyatt Place Mid-town); robes and slippers; fast wifi and great TV; pretty quiet heater, etc. - all the things that you'd expect from a category six Hyatt/Andaz brand. The gym and rooftop lounge were not ready yet, but that was fine since when I am in Manhattan I must walk 4 or 5 miles a day. The location, of course, can't be beat. Subway stations were plentiful and close by, a Starbucks was just across the street, and all the theaters we went were within two blocks, crazy. The hotel is very well managed; someone is doing a great job. Young staffers were well trained in the best Hyatt manner, friendly and courteous. The assistant manager, Liam, was there the whole time of our stay; we were impressed with him and all the people working there. The only minor problem I noticed was that housekeeping was not always impeccable (unfortunately for the housekeepers, even a day's worth of dust is quite noticeable in a new walnut and brass-furnished room with white linens). I have stayed in many Hyatts of all levels and, overall, this one really stands out among other big-city hotels. We slept so well, it was like being in a urban retreat. Just to see what we were missing, I opened the window a crack (yes, they open) and the sound outside was what we would have heard if we had stayed at other hotels around Times Square. Thank you HTS.

When I opened the room doors, I felt at home. (I love that feeling!) Everything was fresh and crisp and the décor was light and airy. The quality of all the furniture (especially the small coffee table) was noteworthy. The bathroom was elegant.The staff were all friendly and accommodating. The only not so great feature I'd say is the hotel restaurant. I agree with other reviews that it's a little pricey for what you get.

Staff is very friendly and talkative. Safety is great, employees at door and elevators. Also it was raining and they have umbrellas at front door for you to use.

Service was wonderful... Friendly, accommodating staff. Rooms were more spacious then expected. Had two adjoining rooms on the 30th floor. Kids in the double, husband and I in the king. Mini fridge, safe & lg screen LCD TV are nice touches. Plenty of conveniently-located outlets for all my husband's electronics. In-room food svc avail, although we didn't take advantage. We ate lunch at the T45 Restaurant located in the hotel. Very good salads and spicy ""fried"" chix wings. Back to the room... We enjoyed the pillows a lot and to my delight, they allowed you to purchase ($65/per). Location to Times Square and Broadway, was ideal. Valet & concierge services are top notch. Only downfall is the cost of everything... $4 for a bottle of water (hotel) and $6 for a cup of tea (restaurant), but we've come to expect this during our visits to the City, especially in this area. Only other minor complaint is the ""dryness"" of the rooms which is common in large hotels. However, you can request a humidifier for your room, if this is problematic. Hoping the service continues beyond the ""honeymoon"" period. We'll definitely stay again when we visit in the spring.","Phoenix, Arizona",28,4.0

There was mac and cheese on the menu and I think I recall it being over $10. I really intended on eating at the diner but it was just unreasonably priced. I went and had three slices of pizza and a drink for less. You can’t go wrong with the hotel and the location. Right in the middle of Manhattan,…in the middle of it all.

And with our 4 spent nights here, it didn't disappoint! The staff were top notch and very helpful and so cheerful always sporting an unforced smile! Special shout to Steve the doorman who always had a smile for my wife and greeted us everytime we entered/exited, even in the minus 14 temperatures! Our 34th floor room had a beautiful view of the City and sported a superb state of the art entertainment centre of which the centrepiece was a huge 50"" LG Smart TV! The only reasons I gave 1 less star is due to the 54th floor 'Sky Bar' not being open as yet and our room being just a tad smaller than expected as we struggled to house our 4 large pieces of luggage.

It was so nice to just stroll a few blocks back to our room on the cool rainy January nights. The hotel is so new, and clean, and modern. Loved the bathroom. More hotels should do away with tubs, and curtains and use nice walk in stalls with glass doors and overhead rainshower heads. Very nice. The beds are very comfortable. Room is spacious by NYC standards, although there is not a lot of room for luggage. 2 bags for 2 people is about max that will fit. a very minor nitpick about the room...I really dislike the way the lights are wired together, with common switches. I could never figure out how to get the lights I wanted. Who wants to turn on the bathroom light and have the room lights go on?? Please, hotel designers...just put switches on the lamps. Its better that way.The staff is really unbelievably warm and friendly. Everyone said hello and had a smile for us, and helped. When we needed an umbrella, and the doorman had run out, the manager quickly found a new one for us to borrow. We ate breakfast in the attached diner and found the friendliness extended into there. The waiter knew our coffee preferences by the second morning, and was very nice. Food was good. A little expensive, but hotel restaurants always are.

My family and I spent 9 nights at the Hyatt Times Square.. When we first arrived we felt straight at home ... we were warmly welcomed by Aaron and Steve ... who were always so helpful everytime we arrived back at the hotel or left to go somewhere... whether it was dinner or sightseeing..Thank you!! Than the warm welcome at Reception by all the staff... and the security.. they were all hospitable .. and as for the most wonderful and helpful Andrew.. The Concierge... Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! He really knows his stuff.. always on the ball and very informative..So.... so far.... So GOOD..!!The ROOMSBefore I made a booking for this hotel I did a lot of research for New York Hotels...The Room was spacious with 2 nice sized beds .. (most important..NEW... and NO BED BUGS!!)comfortable linen and pillows.. lots of space so pretty spacious with the 4 of us in one room..THE BATHROOM... We were there over New Years.. so it was cold... but the pro of the Bathroom was that it was SPACIOUS... WARM as it had underfloor heating..so when you step out of the Shower... its nice and warm... The shower was nice and spacious.. you could have a small party in there!!The view was Ok but really guys being in the heart of Times Square what view are we really gonna get.. unless you wanna see Times square itself .. and being on 45th .. we were really unaffected by our view we were in room 3007... Floor 30... it was peaceful..obviously on New Years Eve we heard noise.. Housekeeping were very tolerant.. seeing we would only leave the room round 11 some mornings.. we were never harassed.. and the room was always cleanThe ROOM has a safe and mini bar.. which is always useful to stock a few perishablesLocation..was fantastic I tell you why.. originally I booked for the Renaissance Times Square and after seeing the location I am very happy I booked the Hyatt Times sq reason being you will not be trampled on when you leave the hotel.. as the renaissance has millions of people passing the front entrance. I am sure its very nice if you want a view of Times Square when they have the Ball drop or you like the hustle and bustle..One negative.. I think that wifi should be free or there should be a minimal charge when staying at the hotel... there is free lobby wifi.. but all it does is make the hotel look shabby with Guests lounging around on their phones using the free lobby wifi...doesn't make sense..hopefully the hotel can change their policy on this one to make my rating 10/10 as this is really the most annoying thing out of my entire stay..I would like to Thank all the staff at the Hyatt Times Square for making mine and my families stay so memorable...Good Luck for 2014..,"Durban, South Africa",3,5.0

Great location. It should be said that all rooms are above the 23rd floor which means that you get to be in the belly of the beast and yet sleep soundly. Very new hotel with a boutique feel and small tastefully decorated lobby. Upon entering the hotel I immediately noticed the check-in machines. I've said this before; I like to think that these machines can augment the check-in/check-out experience and not replace the human touch that makes good hotels stand out. This was indeed the case here at the Hyatt Times Square. After noticing the machines I looked toward the check-in desk and was immediately greeted by one of the friendly staff members behind the counter who was willing to help me get checked-in. This is really the most interaction I have at any hotel and the staff here were ready and willing to help. The rooms feel new. The bathrooms felt very clean and modern. The room has a large 40""+ sized TV. There is the ability to open the window about a 8-12 inches so you can get a feel for the city below if you want. Other than that probably as you would expect. Slightly odd ornamentation above the bed which included a small porcelain figure that looked like a balloon animal(?).Although I didn't have an opportunity to dine there, the restaurant off the lobby had a menu full of tasty dishes. There was a special of 30% off menu prices for hotel guests for breakfast and dinner.The only other thing I would mention is that there seemed to be a lot of employees in the lobby at all times. I counted 6 minimum and at point counted 10 people! Overall the room was great; very clean and well maintained. A good solid experience from the Hyatt brand.",Austin,13,4.0

There were numerous problems.We had requested a view of Times Square. When we arrived, whatever room we had been assigned too, obviously did not have a view. Terese said she would try to get us higher up for a better view. Hard to tell what the original view must have been. What we got with the higher up room on the 12th floor was a view of a white water tank and a gymnasium with people on a treadmill. We think the hotel should have called us and informed us that what we requested was not available so we could have changed to a different hotel. Next, we asked the Conceirge directions to Rockefeller Center so we could walk to it. The Conceirge gave us wrong directions and we probably walked a mile turning the wrong way as he had informed us in freezing cold weather. Thankfully, a homeless man on the street showed us the right way. We were most apreciative of him. The room (1207) was small. Not nearly enough room for 3 suitcases. The heater in the room went on the blink the first night. For well over 10 minuetes it would start and stop every 5 seconds. On and off over and over again every 5 seconds. Finally, it came back to normal operation. The electrical panel for the computer access area overheated. It was quite noticeable and my laptop cord got very hot as did the panel. We then only used one plug and it remained cool. The internet speed was not sufficient to support a skype call we made. The call stopped in the middle of it. There were no heated tiles in the bathroom as we had read about. The newspaper was not delivered as promised until we complained about it. After we had complained, Didi called our room and said she would have management contact us. To date that has not happened. The bathroom ceiling was not caulked in on the ceiling. The ice machine went haywire in the hallway and went on for the longest time making and or dispensing ice. We didnt go out to see what it was. The T45 diner did not appeal to us. It looked a little bit like what you'd see in a food court in an airport terminal. Didnt appeal to us. We didnt eat there. .On the plus side, the two outside doormen, Steve and Chester are by far the best employees. They really do a good job. The location of the hotel is good and only a short walk to Times Square but we did have to walk by piles of garbage that was on the sidewalk and street. Our grandson left his Elmo blanket underneath one of the sheets and we didnt realize it until after we had checked out. We called and the maid, Evelyn, must have found it and turned it in. Thank you Evelyn! When we called the hotel they said they would ship it to us but we would have to pay the air bill. Thought that was a bit cheap, but we were happy to hear it had been found. To date, there has been no charge for the shipping of the Elmo blanket. Special thanks to Laura L for shipping it to us. The welcome greeting on the TV when we entered the room was nice. Overall though, we were very disappointed. It was certainly not what we expected or requested. Several things did not work or happen and we wonder if there isnt an electrical problem in room 1207 due to an overheated eletrical panel and heater malfunction. The view was certainly not of Times Square as we had requested.","Marco Island, Florida",19,2.0

Every question we had was answered in a remarkable way (roads to take, good restaurants, important things to know about the city of New York). Unfortunately, I have only one negative review to share. There is a charming little restaurant / bar on the first floor of the hotel, we were very happy to know that there was this place because we were in New York for work, and we thought it would been nice to eat breakfast in the morning at this place and drink a glass of wine in the evening ... But we were shocked to see the price, this is too much! I understand that the hotel is in Times Square and it is supose to be more expensive, we were willing to pay a little more because of the location, but it was just ridiculously expensive.

The location is great. Very close to Times Square, but enough off the square that you can avoid the mobs if you want to. Easy walking distance to Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center and most of the subway lines. Our room was on the 46th street side on the 30th floor and was very quiet. The Good: The hotel is new and clean. The beds are very comfortable with lots of feather pillows (foam available at request). Towels are luxurious too. The shower had a rain head and a hand held, good water pressure and constant temperature. The room has a large TV, safe, alarm clock, wireless phone, refrigerator and coffee maker. They will bring you a tea pot if you prefer and have a long list of things you can request (lighted make up mirror, curling iron, steamer etc.) Each nightstand had two plugs. The desk area also has two plugs, a USB port and a huge variety of other types of ports that would allow you to hook up all sorts of media to the TV I presume. There is a window that opens a bit which is nice. The Bad: Very little storage in this room. It would appear that there are 9 drawers in the unit at the end of the bed as well as three bedside tables (in rooms with two beds) but it isn't so. The unit at the foot of the bed has 3 small drawers. The rest of the unit contains the refrigerator, safe and coffee maker. The bedside tables have a false drawer that actually pulls out for additional table surface. A family of three, in winter, for 7 days, needs more than three small drawers and a closet with 8 hangers. (I'm sure they would have given more if we had asked, but we just folded everything and put it on the closet shelf.)The room has a complicated lighting system. While it's nice to have one button at the bed and door that allows you to turn off all the lights, and the mood lighting option was nice when getting ready for bed, if your spouse turns off the lights in the bedroom, you can be left standing in a dark shower, or alternatively, you select the nightlight option to go to the restroom in the middle of the night, and it turn on a light in the bedroom too. The TV is using IP and freezes up constantly. The beds had a lovely duvet, but no flat sheet which I thought was really odd. Just the duvet. No option to sleep with just a sheet if you get hot. The HVAC worked really well, but it does blow on you in the bed. My husband was sick and he ended up sleeping with his head at the foot of the bed to get away from the air blowing on him.Other general info: The only free wifi is in the lobby and there is only one bench there. The ""business center"" is actually two stand up computers and a printer. You can print boarding passes for free, but anything else requires a credit card swipe. Wifi in the rooms is available for a fee. The restaurant was just average, and for what you pay, you can find better food with a short walk. The staff was delightful.

Just a couple of things, it was the night of the snow storm and my flight was hovering between being cancelled or extremely late. I am Hyatt Diamond and when I called to explain that I may not arrive until the morning, the first response was that I was still going to pay for the night. Wait...I spend countless nights in Hyatt's a year, was coming from one Hyatt to another Hyatt....and the snowstorm of 2013 was delaying my arrival and you are still going to charge me?? Get real.The hotel itself was great...btw....the elevators don't work real well and take you to lots of destinations except where you really want to go. Restaurant wasn't open yet. Fitness club was perfect and immaculate. Rooms were spacious and clean especially for NYC standards. Surprised that there weren't USB charging ports in a brand new city hotel, but no big deal. Housekeeping staff was amazing, polite, and can't say enough good about them.Would go back except for one thing which is beyond their control...too close to Times Square...especially Times Square at Christmas time.

On the negative side i'd expect some common space in a hotel, a reception lobby, perhaps a bar, somewhere to sit and wait for family coming down, facilities that you'd think would be standard in a hotel. There was none of this - the ground floor had only 2 toilets for the whole ground both M/F facilities so only toilets for any one in the hotel - ground floor - they also served the new diner that had just opened - see below. Simply not enough.On the food side - when we first arrived they had set up the 2nd floor as a buffet breakfast and although it was small it was actually very good. 2 days in the diner on the ground floor opened and the breakfast buffet was closed. No notice at all we tuned up to eat and it had gone. We were guided to the diner that had just opened on the ground floor. We had eaten in the diner on the previous night (1st night it opened) and it was poor - the food was simply not great and outshone by the pubs to the left and the right of the hotel - so we went to the pub for breakfast - paid about half of what we had paid in the buffet the morning before but having said if they ran the buffet we'd still have eaten there.I'm hoping that they see sense and re open the breakfast buffet.","London, United Kingdom",11,3.0

The hotel was still ironing out a few kinks from the opening. The elevators were not working properly, and there were loads of workmen putting on finishing touches here and there.The room was a little on the small side, but the bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom had a great shower and heated floor tiles. Breakfast was relatively inexpensive, especially for New York. It consisted of a smallish but tasty buffet. It could have used a couple more healthier options like fresh fruit, yoghurt, granola, but had a variety of pastries, meats, cereals, and an omelet bar.Throughout the stay the service was great - not always what you expect in New York.

Also the rooftop bar will be open at end of Jan. Rooms were quite comfortable and well appointed. The staff is very friendly and Richard even gave me a free Hyatt umbrella on Tuesday morning as a wet snow was falling in NYC then. I only had two basic complaints: when did hotels of this caliber stop putting coffee makers in room? Second, I wish there was some seating in the lobby/concierge areas as I was waiting for a call and after being on my feet all day at the convention, I was exhausted. I realize space is limited in lobby here but maybe seat benches back in concierge area? Otherwise a fine establishment. Spa is opening on 3rd floor soon too.

I stayed at this Hotel using my Two Free Nights after signing up for their Chase Hyatt Card.The Hotel is located between 6th and 7th Avenue on West 45th Street in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, bustling with Broadway patrons filing into restaurants nearby. And thick traffic honking thru Times Square.I used the AirTrain at JFK to reach the hotel via Jamaica Station where I switched to the E Subway Train, which is the Express into Manhattan. That cost me $7.50 one way.The Hotel did not have my requested room ready at check-in, which was to be a Double Queen Room. My nephew was joining me at the Hotel later. Steven, at the Front Desk, immediately offered me an upgrade for a King Bed with a view of Times Square, which I accepted. He personally took me to my room to see if I approved. And then 15 minutes later called me to let me know my original room request was ready. Steven, again, personally moved me to my preferred room, again, with a view.My request for late 2PM checkout was approved on the spot.The room is a good size and there is a desk with lamp. Floor lamp in the corner with a sitting chair and side table; reading lamps and night lights below the night stands, all controlled by buttons on the wall near the bed and desk area.The Flat Screen Television offered all Digital HD programming. There are 3 STARZ CINEMA channels to watch and a long list of the usual channels like Food Network, ESPN, CNN, etc. You can connect your personal devices to the Screen at the desk.Guest Services sent up sundries I had not packed—toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant and mouthwash-- all gratis. As I put them away in the bathroom, I realized the tile floor is heated by control panel on the wall!! Fantastic in mid December NYC!! What a treat to return from the snow and wind outside and stand on the deeply warming tiles.The beds are wonderful. My nephew asked me if he snored all night, which he did. He only snores when he sleeps very deeply and soundly—and he greatly approved of the bed. I slept well, too.The restaurant is not completed. The bar on the rooftop is not completed. Steven offered to have sandwiches brought up from the tiny food market in the lobby. I think there is more option in walking next door to the deli which features everything you could want including a salad bar, deli counter, sushi and udon noodles, pizza, etc. Other nearby places to eat that we saw include Olive Garden, McDonalds, Planet Hollywood, Buca di Beppo, Subway, TGIFs, and many many other food joints.Everything is near the hotel. 30 Rockefeller Plaza with the famed ice rink and Christmas Tree, St. Patricks Cathedral and St. Thomas Cathedral, FENDI, Tiffanys, The Rockettes, Broadway Shows, and at least 3 different Subway lines with multiple entries in every direction steps from the Hotel. Great Police presence at all hours, too.I asked Guest Services where I could print documents. They directed me to computers near the Lobby behind Front Desk. I was shocked to see it was not free-- $5.95 for 15 minutes of Internet, charged to your credit card, and additional money to print pages. The machine would not read my card so I asked Stacey at Front Desk for help. She graciously let me log in to my Gmail at her Front Desk Terminal, and printed my document. So grateful for that small favor.Check out was quick and easy. They removed the Internet charge for my stay because I am Platinum Member. My nephew and I dove into a taxi out front, hailed by the doorman, and we were at Penn Station in 10 minutes flat—I timed it. Can’t wait to come back to HYATT TIMES SQUARE!!
