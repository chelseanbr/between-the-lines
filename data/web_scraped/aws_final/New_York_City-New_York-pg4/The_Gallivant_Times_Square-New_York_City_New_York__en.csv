We had family from France flying to NY for the event. I had booked two hotels rooms for family to come and celebrate. The graduation was cancelled along with the rest of our travel plans. All of our flights were refunded except for the hotel. I originally booked a non-refundable rate which I understand the terms of that, however, these are extenuating circumstances, some that no one could predict. All I was allowed was a voucher for this specific hotel to be used within a year. My family from France certainly does not plan on flying here anytime soon and I am a healthcare worker still working many overtime hours taking care of those in need. I most likely will not be able to book these rooms again and will lose out on over a thousand dollars. Many businesses have been flexible during these times, I most certainly will be bringing my business elsewhere than the Gallivant Times Square.","Boston, Massachusetts",0,1.0

I booked the PH has no balcony access, a shower that dripped all day and night, Tiny bathroom considering its a 2 B/R and the bathroom is through the bedrooms so not great if two couples booked it. I had a number of issues with the hotel and emailed the manager to discuss before doing any reviews however this has been ignored so now here's my review. I booked the PH for $2000 (just over - for my 40th Birthday treat) and my friends booked a family for $600. Her room was larger, had a huge balcony she could access and also had an extremely last master bathroom, the type you would expect in a Penthouse! I had no access to my balcony through construction (was not informed at any point, until I walked into the room to find out for myself) The door wasn't even secure and blew open twice during the night from the wind. The shower dripped all day and night and cleaners left towels in the shower tray to try and reduce noise, it didn't work and was very annoying when trying to sleep! The manager on site was polite but seems had no power to offer any compensation or alternatives which is ridiculous. I would definitely say if you're going to stay here, get the cheaper room. Youll be crazy if you pay what I did when you see what the other rooms get in comparison.The positive for the hotel is the location - 2 mins to Times Sq without the constant noise.",,0,2.0

I do like it to be fairly cool to sleep but I couldn't reduce the temp as the fan was too noisy to leave on for too great a time.

Been to NYC 3 times now and this is by far the best location.Quick service - the hairdryer broke, rang down and new one at my door within minutes. Batteries died in the remote - same thing, less than 5 mins. Really great service in that way.Lovely smell in the reception area. Fancy fish tank.Cons:This hotel has jumped on the “resort fee” bandwagon. They’ve named theirs “urban tax” seen as referring to themselves as a resort is stretching it. For your urban tax, of a massive $35 per day, you get WiFi and a small bottle of water. Before this crazy charge such things were included or complimentary - to claim water and WiFi is an added extra in 2020 is a bit silly. So you might get a great nightly rate on your hotel site - but remember to add $35 to that! It’s a shame this hotel have jumped on this bandwagon, I hope this resort fee craze is the next thing to be regulated.Cleanliness - not great. I thought it could do with a good scrub when I arrived but it wasn’t terrible. Then on the last day a huge cockroach came strolling out from under my bed!! Gross! It looked like something out of men in black. I let reception know and went to breakfast so they could go in and get it, but they mustn’t have been able to find it because when I came back there it was right behind the door. My husband had to stand on it and it crawled up his leg. Absolutely disgusting. Now this maybe isn’t a huge deal to New Yorkers (?) but you don’t get these where I’m from and it totally grossed me out.Room is small but that’s to be expected in NY.So all in all points lost for the resort fee and the attacked of the giant man eating cockroach (ok maybe it wouldn’t have eaten me but it was huge)","Grimsby, United Kingdom",21,2.0

Night managers are rude and inconsiderate. Spent the last of our honeymoon there from Thursday 27th Feb to Sunday 1st March. Got no sleep at all due to road noise, even though we were originally on 10th floor. Heating made a continuous clunking throughout the night. Paint peeling from ceilings, carpets in corridors threadbare and stained. Holes in bedroom walls badly filled in, paintwork atrocious, very dark colours and poor lighting. Nothing like as shown on website. There website is misleading and misrepresents what you get. Claim that wi-fi is free but was covered in their urban fees. Had to be moved to third floor on second night after arguing with manager from midnight to 2 am as their was a rave in a warehouse next door. Noise was unbelievable. Second room on third floor was smaller and dirtier and had no heating. It was minus 1 degree celsius outside! In both rooms the shower was hanging off the wall. Water stains on bedroom ceiling. They also hit you with additional charges called an ""urban fee"". Charge you $50 per night, then deduct $36.42 per night, but you may not get deposit back because of ""incidentals"".

Anything you asked them about, help wise seemed to be a big deal. They were quite rude & short. When it came to customer service they deffo need training. In the end from talking to other people they were like it to everyone.At the end of our stay I was asked if I would like the room tax taken of the card I used for bond which I didn’t as I had a Revolut card with $ on that I wanted to use instead.I gave the card to the receptionist who swiped it, then had a smirk on her face as she informed me it had declined. I asked her how they processed payments as my card wasn’t setup for contactless or online payments & her answer was that she didn’t have a clue. I asked her to try my card again & again it declined. I asked if she could wait one moment while I logged on to the card app & she huffed & puffed even though I was the only person stood at reception. My app told me they were trying to make a online payment which is why card was declined. I changed the settings in the app for the card to except online payments & asked her to try again & hey presto payment excepted.The receptionist then handed me the receipt without even a thank you or a good bye.It doesn’t take much to be nice.So before anyone thinks about staying at this hotel 1st make sure you check out trip advisor to see what it says about staff like we should have........","Lamphey, United Kingdom",0,3.0

I would not recommend for families or people who want to sleep at night. We were on the 15th floor and apparently there was a club or party doing on downstairs on a Friday night. It was SUPER loud even though we were so high up. If you're a light sleeper, you'll hate it. The rooms are small but cozy, bed is moderately firm, and the cable TV was pretty good. The fixtures and decor is modern. The water pressure and hot water were great. The outlets are not positioned in convenient places, so be mindful of that. Hope your appliances or chargers have long cords! Also, the shower has no door so water gets everywhere. The bathroom is super-small, so it's good for solo travelers or maybe one extra person. There's nowhere to store your toiletries. Also, the room temperature is tricky to adjust and the method to do it is archaic. One minute it was super hot in the room, the next drafty.They offer convenience of free check-in of your bags if you get in earlier than the 3 p.m. check-in, which is awesome. (I tried to call ahead to see if I could pay for early check in and find availability. They put me on hold two times and then third time just hung up on me. When I arrived, they claimed they had no availability for the early check in.) Also, the only other amenities they offer in the rooms is a mini-coffee maker (with pods and powder creamer/sugar).I've lived in NYC for years and now travel there on business so if you're not from the city and you're traveling with family or want space/better amenities, try either staying outside the city (in Queens or New Jersey) or tough it out in smaller spaces, less amenities and maybe not-so-friendly customer service.

Looking at previous reviews we were slightly worried but from a great welcome by the reception staff (male name unknown) we were allocated room 903 which was at the end of a corridor and found to be very tidy, small in size but perfect for a 3 day base. We did have roof top air con units and street noise outside but this is to be expected in the Middle of New York City. I class this as white noise as no sleep was interrupted. You are only 2 mins walk from Time Square, 5 mins from the Rockafella Centre and Hells Kitchen. Would advise if you want milk in tea, buy a small carton as powdered creamer is not the same. On that note there is no fridge in the room. Not a problem for us. Glad I chose this hotel for our NYC visit and will gladly return againPlease don't let the bad reviews put you off!",,4,5.0

The location of this hotel is excellent! Just off Times Square. You couldn't ask for a better location. The room was small but contained a queen sized bed, drawers, large flat screen TV, cupboard for hanging clothes and safety deposit box. The room was modern and clean. The bed was extremely comfy. The bathroom was small and the shower took a while to heat up but once it got warm it was a great hot powerful shower. The lifts were slow and small but we were on the second floor so walked down the stairs. We got fresh towels and the room cleaned during our stay. Yes you have to pay a deposit up front on a card but you get this back 3 - 5 days after check out so long as you dont use anything (room service, movies etc) The lobby area is very modern and has plenty of seating and smelt lovely!!! There is a desk in the corner next to check in where you can phone for transfers or book tours etc. There is free Wifi in the hotel which is fast and works.

We booked a deluxe 2 doubles room through travel republic. With all the bad reviews I was concerned, however I needn’t have been. The location is great - 48th between broadway and 8th Avenue. On arrival check in was quick and we were allocated room 1029. However upon entering it was clear this wasn’t the room we booked. This room was a box with 2 single beds. I went back to reception and the man showed me the confirmation they received from travco who travel republic use stating 2 single beds. A call to TR out of hours and 20 mins on hold to be told they couldn’t get hold of their hotel supplier that evening. Luckily the hotel advised they could move us and would temporarily hold the upgrade charge on my card until the supplier contacted them. They allocated us room 1228 and this looked exactly like the picture on the website. We had to leave a card for the security deposit of $50 per night, this showed as pending on my account. Several calls to TR and the room issue was finally sorted - confirmed by the hotel when we returned. The room had a large TV, coffee maker, safe, plenty of storage, hairdryer. The beds were comfy. The room was cleaned daily. There was bottled water available on reception. We didn’t use any of the facilities, on check out they charged our card for the resort fees - it showed immediately what I was being charged and the deposit released. I would definitely stay again price dependant. No complaints. ","Camberley, United Kingdom",146,4.0

Myself and my friend were told we would receive the refund in 7 days by the reception staff, it is now the 23rd of February and we have not received our refund.Positives of staying here:- Prime location.Negatives of staying here:- Be prepared for poor customer service, on arrival we were told to wait with no explanation other than the ""system has gone down"" (thanks to the guy on reception however who was very helpful in giving us advice and directions with a warm approach and friendly smile)- False advertisement/photography on website if you stay in a standard room, it is TINY, OUTDATED and GRUBBY; looks NOTHING like it does on the website - (I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME ON INSTAGRAM AND I WILL SEND YOU THEM OVER @elliesole)- Ask if you are next to an elevator, we were disturbed nightly with the clinking and clanking of the elevator next to our room (700) - (I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME ON INSTAGRAM AND I WILL SEND YOU THEM OVER @elliesole)- Be aware that there are no duvet covers, the duvet is placed between two bed sheets.- Housekeeping will not make your bed if you sort of, half make it (we were trying to be polite)- Check for all damaged items (and take pictures) as we had seen on reviews prior to arrival that the hotel has tried to take security deposits from travellers who have not damaged anything in the room.- No fridge.Overall, it was a pretty crappy stay; we put up with it however as we were out most of the day to explore.So, if you are looking for a cheap pit stop, for a night or two two explore the city then take my advice and I'm sure you'll have an adequate stay.If you are looking for a spacious, comfortable, quiet, attentive and reliable stay - I highly recommend you do not stay here.","Portsmouth, United Kingdom",15,1.0

Refused to help or cancel and re key even though he could see the error too. Took none of my details then told me I would need to email my complaint when I get home! I emailed and have had no acknowledgement from anyone. But 3 days later this was corrected. Not even a courtesy email to let me know.

It was too small but we were on a budget so had no choice but to keep it. Walls are thin, lifts are slow, our extractor fan was literally hanging off the ceiling.

It was part of a winter deal and When you pay little don’t expect too much. Firstly though good points, really handy for central Times Square, literally a few minutes and you are on it.

Close to Central Park etc. Handy for the subway only two blocks away. All the theatres are within a few blocks. Staff very good and friendly. The downsides would be the rooms, I paid an extra ten dollars a night to upgrade to a bigger room, would have hated to see what I was originally getting. Our room was basic and tired looking, the bathroom was tiny, a real reverse in and walk out to use the toilet. Our original room had no view due to plastic on the windows, also they were single glazed meaning we heard everything. We were on the 12th floor but could hear ones talking on the street below. Thankfully they agreed to move us. Can’t comment on the gym or pool as I did not use or see them. However, I had the privilege of having to pay a surcharge for them.

It appears that after checking our booking docs, there was no mention of a tax in our original booking T&Cs, however, this was later added via a booking ammendment email and we were not informed of this addition so be careful of that!Our room was underwhelming to say the least, we looked at photos of the standard rooms at the hotel online and the room we got was nothing like what the online images show. Please see the photos below.The radiator in the room (which was hanging off the wall) kept us both up all night, even when it was turned off weirdly! We had to complain to the front desk, to which we were told that we had one of the nicer rooms and that it was just the building and you get used to it. We eventually changed rooms, and it was better, but our radiator was broken and was constantly pumping out heat and could not be turned off. So we had to complain again to get this fixed. If I was coming back to NY, I would definitely just pay a little more and stay somewhere much nicer, the location is great but with the transport connections available, this hotel is not worth it.Having looked on the TUI website again, it appears that TUI are listing this hotel anymore as I can no longer find it.

The rooms were spacious (twin room) and everything was perfect!That was until 9:30pm that night workmen started refurbishing every hotel room on our floor, we made complaints but these fell on deaf ears, the receptionist simply did not care and suggested we invested in ear plugs! I am not exaggerating when I say we had around 20 workmen outside our room shouting and working from 9pm-4am EVERY SINGLE NIGHT! Every morning we was promised that the works had finished on our floor, every night we had them back shouting. Turns out it was a check in mistake and we was never supposed to of been given the 9th floor but they refused to move us. When a room did become available I was offered to be moved to the 8th floor...where they has just started working, it was a complete joke! Our trip was completely ruined as we did not sleep at all. The reception staff did not care and were extremely rude with one stating she had bigger problems then me complaining about lack of sleep, when you have paid out for a trip of a lifetime I think anyone is well within their right to complain about blokes being outside there door all night with a master key! We was the only guests on the floor the first night and felt completely unsafe. We tried to speak to the manager everyday but she was either not in yet or unavailable, it go to the point that I had to email her for a response as we couldn't see her face to face. She has promised a refund via our booking agent but not heard anything as yet. The Hotel is nicely decorated and in the perfect location, if it wasn't for the works and the rude and disrespectful staff I would highly recommend. If you are booked to stay here over the next couple of weeks I really do urge you to call ahead and request a room away from the refurbishments. Although not sure how much help that would be as none of the staff knew what floors the workmen would be on from one night to the next. I am not one to complain at all and often read reviews on here and think get over it but my god it was a bloody awful experience.",,33,1.0

Bedroom walls are paper thin and the doors are not soft close so we could hear conversations and the slamming of doors. I think we only got one good night's sleep when we were there.

We booked two rooms a twin and a double. They were both on the 8th floor, the twin was bigger than the double and the twin to the front of the building was a quieter room then the double. The twin room: The sinks were not cleaned properly, there was hair on the sink when we arrived that was obviously from a mans shaver which had not been cleaned up. The shower where the dial pointed to 'Red' for hot was actually cold and vice versa. The water didn't flow down the drain so after a minute you were standing ankle deep in waste water. This then took about minutes to drain before the next person could get in. The beds were fine but they only provided one pillow per bed and then one spare. Our TV channels weren't lined up correctly for example the information page would say CNN but if you clicked that it would be a sports game etc. Our remote broke and they sent someone up very quickly to help. In double room: The heating system broke on new years eve and the room was like a furnace. While they sent someone up to 'fix it' straight away it wasn't properly fixed and remained very warm for the duration of the stay. The also suggested that we would get money back on check out however the receptionist never brought this up and we didn't want to cause a fuss as we needed to catch a flight. On new years eve we wanted to go to Brooklyn Bridge and I asked the receptionist the best way to get there, she didn't know and then gave me wrong information so be careful and double check everything on google maps. We booked a taxi with the concierge who was very helpful however, the taxi company he booked with sent a very old limo and suggested that we would travel with another family, this was fine with us and the other couple however, 50 meters up the road the car broke down and we had to wait for 20 minutes for another car which was a suv and was also not very new. I would suggest being mindful of the company that they book their airport transfers with as the new driver told us that things like that happen all the time.","Groningen, The Netherlands",13,3.0

To heat the room there’s a big electric air conditioning unit next to the bed which regardless of the setting we instructed it to do just blew cold air until we gave up and turned it off.

I am really willing to spend some time focused on helping other people not to jeopardize their NY experience by staying at the Gallivant. My first room was on the 2nd floor and the scaffolding on the outside made terrible noises due to the wind and was really a hassle when it came to sleeping time. The windows were tremendously dirty and it was just sad looking through them - my fiancee and I tried to clean them but after our 4th attempt, the cloth was still coming out completely black. I can’t imagine how long it has been since it was properly washed. There wasn’t a desk with a chair on the room, and when I had to do something for work (about 30min/day), I had do utilize my notebook lying on the bed. The heating unit was overheating and not responding to the commands on the wall, the technician came in, couldn’t fix and his recommendation was we adjusted the temperature by opening the window - this is not a joke. I was moved to a 2nd room on the 10th floor. We don’t have any of the previous problems, but we were welcomed to a set of new ones: the safe was not working so I checked the batteries and realized they were being held by duct tape and cardboard (again, this is not a joke). I reattached the duct tape and it was functional again, but there is a great chance that it will come loose with all my stuff in there and I am not sure if the hotel staff will be able to retrieve my belongings in due time. The TV system is simply outrageous: if I connect my notebook through an HDMI cable (which I bought in NY just for this means) I can watch 30 min maximum before the TV blacks out and stops responding to any command. The only solution is to disconnect and reconnect the power plug, wait for the system to initialize, and watch another 20/30 min before it happens again. The exhaustion fan on the bathroom is not working and since it doesn’t have windows or any kind of ventilation, we have to spray perfume and wait sometime after we utilize it in order for the other one to come in - really romantic having to do this in the trip we became engaged. The night technician couldn’t fix it and said he had no spare parts to fix it. The front desk person said we should give it a try with the morning technician - who may have spare parts. All of those problems were noticed right away on our first night ant the new room. Morning came and I solicited a technician for the TV and fan. 30 min and no one showed up. I did it again, the front desk person said the technician was on its way but again, 30 minutes and no one showed up, so I left my room since I am on this trip to enjoy the city. After reporting these problems, front desk suggested we moved again, to A THIRD ROOM within our stay. Not only it is really frustrating having to pack everything and check-in at the reception, as it is a great waste of our scarce vacation time. On top of that, I am at a point in which I can already imagine what kind of problems our next room will bring us. I am not naive to think, after all of this experience, that the third room won’t have major issues. On top of all that, my fiancee tried to warn the reception that the beverage vending machine isn’t working (coins just go directly through to the change container and bills are taken in but the machine doesn’t recognize it - you just lose the money) and the response was “YOU should call the phone displayed on the machine and ask for maintenance” - again, I’m not joking and this was the actual response she got. I have traveled quite a bit in my life and had some bad experiences at hotels, but the Gallivant Times Square outperforms all of those and I can’t recommend it to anyone. The location is perfect and a part (maybe half) of the staff I talked to is really polite, but having in mind the price I was charged, the Gallivant gest a 0 out of 10.","Belo Horizonte, MG",1,1.0

I’m giving them a 1/10 for proximity to Times Square only. We stayed from the 21-24th October. The room we had was smaller than our cabin on a ship but what l didn’t expect was that the cleaning staff didn’t even bother moving back the cupboards and desk that had obviously been moved around from last guest. We couldn’t access the cupboard drawers without having to reposition. Bedside lights weren’t working. Aircon inadequate. The drainage pipe was blocked so when showering water was filling up over the side onto the bathroom floor. We asked to move rooms which was approved. No offer of assistance by staff. Moved to a room on 4th floor. Traffic noise unbearable as we were closer to the road. They had a flimsy piece of plastic on the window. Not double glazing like most hotels. Room slightly bigger though. Twice we had had no hot water and the drain was also blocked, flooding the bathroom. When we went to front desk to report both they stated there was not a problem with the hot water etc. Totally dismissing us.....as if we were imbeciles! It took some heated demanding but they did send someone eventually to check.....though certainly did not act immediately. GUESS WHAT....we were right, no hot water. After lots of banging etc it came on and cleared the blocked drain. YEH! Our coffee/tea maker was broken so we had exchanged it for the one in our previous room. The downstairs stair door was outside our room so very audible most of the night from being used because the lift was so slow and bumpy. Even their own staff gave us the heads up that the stairs were quicker to use. The bumpiness was normal apparently. Staff had to use one of the 3 lifts so you could wait ages before one arrived. On each floor large linen baskets would remain near the lifts full of wet, soggy linen and towels. These baskets seemed to have a life of there own constantly obstructing the lift door or the passageway so you had to constantly move them to get by....Breakfast was a whole other bad adventure. It was next door by an adjoining door in a Chinese restaurant. The Continental bfast consisted of 1 juice, 2 sugary cereals, 1 fruit, a banana and a very limp, totally sugary, starchy, no taste pastry. Even remote outback Australia has a better, more wholesome selection. The Gallivant staff were not friendly, totally dismissive, unhelpful and obviously did not like their jobs. when there own staff tell you what is wrong with the place you know you are doomed. By the way we also had scaffolding outside the building and trolleys going up and down outside our room most of the day. A large glass panel above the front door was broken and secured by tape which had been there for sometime by its appearance....so they were obviously not in a rush to repair it. Could have been a potential hazard l’m thinking! This hotel was supposedly a 4 star but having now travelled extensively over the last 6 years in my opinion maybe a 2. Better suited as BACKPACKERS not a hotel. And for all the student groups that were there at the time l would say that is the type of patronage it gets. Actually l have been to much better backpacker accommodation than this certainly with far more friendly, approachable, helpful, obliging staff. Sadly this was not only our complaint as we met an English couple at a nearby pub who were also not satisfied with there room and were having to move. Because we all had paid upfront, to move elsewhere would have been exorbitant as we had paid $510 AU per night for this absolute appalling facility. We had booked it through a travel agent in WA/ Australia and once home put in a complaint to the wholesaler EXCITE HOLIDAYS, that fell on deaf ears...So for all you Aussie travellers please do not book anything through this company. BOOK direct to the USA companies if going to the USA who seen to look after their customers Also do not trust the photos you see on Gallivants website they are completely not trustworthy and they should be fined for false advertising.

Then the next day we were moved to another room, this had no electrics and moved to the 3rd room, this time there was only luke warm water, they wanted to move us again, but we refused. The place was really dated, the staff rude, the front desk very unhelpful, paid the Urban tax and the refunded a days worth due to the downgrade, however less that 5 minutes later checked my bank and the took this back and is still showing on my statement. To make matters worse they also take a security deposit, of £198 this was taken 3 times refunded once and again still showing on my app as out going. Disgusting place.

The windows appeared single glazed with plastic film stuck to them so the room (at the front of the hotel) was very noisy all day and night. As well as the general outside/street noise there is a fire station right on the corner so there was constant noise during the night from fire trucks coming and going.The only positive thing about this hotel was the location but everything else was awful.

We didn’t find a ton of family options in this price range which is why we chose this place. - Room is small but it does the job. It was clean. Not brand new but we had no major issues with cleanliness. - Tons of great food options. Starbucks & Dunkin are right around the corner. - The staff was really sweet. The housekeeping service took care of us and made sure we had what we needed. They told us to grab towels or cups from the cart as we needed. Cons: - Sirens & Honking Throughout the night. It’s near a fire station so if you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs. We slept ok but it definitely is loud. - Heater is loud & controls did not work. It was so hot we slept with the window cracked (with 30 degree temps & sirens outside) not ideal. - FEES: $30 Urban Fee, per day! Hikes your room rate way up. Total “extra fees per day” including taxes and urban fee came to an EXTRA $87 on top of the room rate. It adds up and although it’s not entirely hotel fees - travelers should know what to expect.

The rooms were okay relating to size but the bathroom was incredibly small. I would recommend the Hotel for value for money and location.

We could not open the wardrobe as the bed prevented was too close and could not be moved. i understand you will never get a big room in New York especially not the center but this was ridiculously small. i should be able to open a wardrobe door and fit on a bed for goodness sakeWe decided to go speak to reception as there was no way we could stay here. we spoke to reception and got told that there was no other rooms available apart from a room with two single beds which there was no way we were staying in, i did not bring my boyfriend on holiday for his 21st and spend all that money for this hotel only to be told we had to sleep in different beds and we would have to wait half an hour for the manager so we did and he told us we were in standard room and i explained there was no way that room is what is shown on your website for a standard room and that i would like to be moved rooms. got told i would have to pay for an upgraded room to which i explained that will not be happening as i have already paid for a room that i have not received and i was also on the phone contacting british airways during this as i was far from happy. and then as if by magic the manager said he can give us a room the same size as previous but the bed is bigger. We agreed to go view the room as it was the only one available we got told and we would not be able to move anywere else. the new had a proper sized double bed and the room was much bigger. not massive but large enough for two bodies and two suitcases so we decided this was okay. the bathrooms are so small you cannot move in them, i am 5ft 5 and when sitting on the toilet my legs were touching the wall in front it was very small even for New York. the wooden floors in the room were disgusting even after allegedly being cleaned, the room was facing onto the street so we had scaffolding out of our window which made the loudest noises throughout the night but as this was the last room we could not be moved. Our whole first day was wasted trying to sort rooms and wait for a manager who was extremely rude to us, told us we were wrong (which we were not as the photos on the website proved that), he was not helpful in the slightest until he released i was contacting British airways and i showed him the photos on HIS website to which he initially said was wrong and i said they are fro your website stating the size of rooms with photos. He was the most rude person!! the cleaning staff were lovely however, full of compliments and would always say Also to mention you get charged $34.42 per night per room as an 'urban fee' and 50 dollars per night per room deposit. This deposit takes 5-7 days we got told to go back on a debit card so they take it off and then you have to wait to get it back if the room is left with no damage, far too much money for such a shockingly bad hotel. they say the urban fee is to cover access to the business center which no holiday maker will be using, the fitness center and water upon request. also discount in the Chinese next door that is attached to the hotel discount off flowers, yoga class and mini bar delivery (THERE IS NOT EVEN A MINI FRIDGE IN THE ROOM AND NO ICE DISPENSER ON EVERY FLOOR SO YOU HAVE TO RUN AROUND THE HOTEL LOOKING FOR AN ICE DISPENSER AND TRY FIND ONE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS) we did not use any f these facilities so i don't understand why we had to pay such a high 'urban fee' RIDICULOUS!!!!.

The hotel is incredibly unclean, the windows are single glazed which isn’t desirable in the city centre and caused sleepless nights and I found some of the staff very rude. Our first room seemed ok, the beds were small but it was fine. However the bed was broken on one side as though the springs were missing so my partner had an awful nights sleep so we explained to reception and they changed rooms for us. However the next room was disgusting, it was unclean, it had other people’s hairs, the door in the room was going onto a construction site and yet again the bed was broken. So we then moved rooms again and had the same issue with both cleanliness and the beds. We then spoke to reception and they begrudgingly offered an upgrade and one night without the tax, which was appreciated. (I might add that the tax was unexpected and around 35 dollars a night so be prepared). I will also add that Rachael was so helpful & lovely, however we were then passed on to Cassandra who was very bolshy and spoke to her manager on the phone in a sarcastic tone about our reasoning for wanting to change rooms which was quite demeaning. The upgrade wasn’t hugely different, however it was slightly cleaner and this bed wasn’t broken, so after changing rooms 3 times we sucked it up. As a final point, we bumped into a fellow guest in the elevator who was extremely angry due to a number of live cockroaches he found in his room. If this doesn’t demonstrate the lack of cleanliness I don’t know what does - this is so disgusting and should not happen. The only positive of this hotel is the location, but I would not recommend nor would I visit again. ","London, United Kingdom",9,1.0

However, our experience could not have been better. I was travelling with my teenage son and although (being cheap!) had booked us a double room. I asked at the desk if there were any twin rooms available. Cassandra, who checked us in, was really lovely and friendly and explained that there weren't any twins but if we came down the following morning and asked again there should be one. We went up to our room (very clean double, we knew to expect small rooms in New York so weren't disappointed), literally 5 seconds after walking in Cassandra rang the room to say that a twin had become available, so we moved. Our room was lovely, comfortable, clean and absolutely perfect for the two of us. If I have any criticism at all it's that there wasn't much of a view, but then we literally just slept there and there are plenty of other places to go for a good view of the city! A fridge would have also been nice but it wasn't a problem. Every time we went to or walked past reception we were greeted by really friendly staff (Suny and Cassandra in particular are a credit to the hotel) and given bottles of water to take out or to take back to our room.It was my third time in the city but my sons first time (we were there with my sister and her family for her 50th birthday) and we both had such a wonderful time, it was so nice to have some mum/son time together before he goes to university next year and staying at The Gallivant really made it special.

Blinds tatty and not fit for purpose. Dust bunnies under beds, paintwork dirty, tiling in shower needs a good bleaching and scrub.

Nowhere to store empty cases, so had them stacked by the door and had to move around them, carpets in corridors tatty and filthy.

On going to our room we were immediately disappointed in he size of it given the money we were being charged per night. There was no chest of drawers where you could store your clothes, he wardrobe for hanging clothes was no more than a cupboard which also contained a wall mounted iron, ironing board and a safe so not a great deal of room to hang clothes. The bathroom was about 6 X 3.5 feet in size and this contained the walk-in shower, toilet and sink so if one person was in the bathroom all space was taken. If you were seated on the toilet your knees just about touched the wall in front of you so don't think about trying to read a paper while in the loo. So if thinking about booking this hotel don't believe the room photos you see online.

Can't fault the hotel itself - although they do apply the ""Urban Tax"" which more and more hotels in NYC are doing. This is - basically - an additional security deposit which allows the hotel to advertise lower room rates - your card is pre-authorised a specific amount per night and, providing you don't trash your room, this is released within a week of your last night. The Gallivant fully refunded/released the pre-authorisation on my card in under a week - which was great service.

We booked a twin room. The website seems to make the rooms look a lot larger than they actually are - upon arriving at the room I was quite surprised at how small it was. Despite this, it was clean and comfortable and had an iron and ironing board too. The bathroom was however extremely small and was difficult to shower without the whole bathroom flooding each time!! Also, the location of our room (room 105) meant that our window view was of the courtyard of the hotel with big noisy generators outside - this didn’t really bother us as we only used the hotel as a base but may be disappointing for some. Sadly, upon arrival I was quite disappointed with the service of the gentleman on reception, it was clear that he was struggling to juggle all the jobs and responsibilities he had and it seemed very under-staffed. He was quite rude and abrupt which left a stale taste to the start of our adventure in New York, especially after travelling so far from the UK, it was rushed, not personalised and a bit of a let-down. The WiFi was good in the hotel and was free. Location wise, it was good and only a stones throw away from Times Square and close to subway stations. The hotel also offers a luggage hold facility for $2 per bag - good for those with later flights. All in all, a good hotel which we only used for a base, but if I was to return to New York I would choose a nicer hotel (maybe the Ritz which was right next door, if I win the lottery!)",,1,3.0

I informed the staff on the front desk about this 4 times for them to finally get it sorted. All they said was we will get an engineer to have a look. It did come on at the end but it was the end of the holiday so too little too late. The phone in the hotel did not work. The bed and the bathroom were tiny. The lifts in the hotel took ages to come up to your floor, it took about 5-10 mins, most people walked the stairs. Our TV did not work for the first few days we mentioned this to the staff and they just give us an paper with instructions on how to use it which didn’t help. My boyfriend had to tune it in himself. We couldn’t get the heating to work, the hotel room was freezing all the time. We had to confirm the booking of our shuttle so we asked one of the girls at the front desk to phone them for us (we thought it would be easier) and she didn’t seem very happy to help us out. She even got our flight time wrong even though it clearly said it on the shuttle voucher and then had the cheek to say we told her the wrong flight time but we never. All the information was on the voucher, she was just too lazy to look. The house keeper came round early morning 7:30, 8 and if you didn’t answer your door she would try your door, which I found annoying you could be asleep or in the shower. Only positive thing I would say was the hotel is right in the heart of New York, Times Square is on your door step, Central Park is only a new minutes walk away, Rockefeller isn’t far and the Empire State Building was only 30 mins away. I wouldn’t stay here again and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here either. I never write bad hotel reviews or any reviews. But I thought people should have an idea of what this hotel is like before booking. It looks nice on pictures but don’t be fooled.",,0,2.0

The safe inside the wardrobe was on a shelf so high that anyone around five foot four or less could not see the contents inside and probably have difficulty operating the buttons. The good stuff - friendly staff, especially the Chinese-American staff on duty at breakfast, who may give you a discounted deal on breakfasts if you stay for longer than a couple of days. Excellent breakfasts too, but in an American hotel, surprised to find no hash-browns and no choice of eggs other than scrambled. You might find a banana if you are up early enough. Our room and bed were not large but comfortable and had all we needed. Best thing about the Gallivant is its proximity to good places like Times Square, many theatres and Central Park ( south end ) was only a short walk...Empire State Building , Top of The Rock and further down to Greenwich Village - along Broadway - or the High Line were all walkable, if you like reasonably long walks, but there are no hills to climb.

As it was booked as part of a Cruise package we did not choose the hotel and I can honestly say I would not choose it.

We waited 25 mins stuck on our floor and after hassling reception many many times as we were at risk of missing our taxi to the ship, they finally sent the service elevator for us. The air con is so noisy and in our room it could not be switched off or controlled. Dirty furniture, broken or missing window blinds. Expensive daily taxes. This hotel needs a complete refurb and is relying on its location to tempt you to book.

I appreciate that the Gallivant is in a prime location close to Times Square. The lack of any dining or beverage facilities were not ideal although not an issue given the close proximity of eating and drinking facilities close by. The location was indeed excellent and served as a fantastic base for our holiday. The location is the only positive I can find with the hotel experience however. Firstly, the room should absolutely not be described as deluxe (which i paid extra for). The room is very small and cramped with minimal space available. Consequently, there was nowhere to properly store luggage other than on the floor which served to further reduce the space available. The air conditioning unit in the room worked fine, but made a loud clicking sound everytime it swithched on - very frustrating during the night when the loud click wakes you up and then kicks in every few minutes. Turning it off wasnt an option as the temperatures were high during the week. Adjusting the temperature up helped to reduce the number of times the unit kicked in. I have stayed in many hotels across the US and never encountered that. From the second night onwards the unit began rattling constantly. The reception staff told us that the noise was from the outside unit, not inside and would not even send service staff to check it. We asked to change rooms and were told the hotel was fully occupied. The only way we could get it to stop was to kick or hit the wall beside the unit, which worked for a while until it would start again. We stayed on the 2nd floor so routinely used the stairs to get to our room (there are very few elevators and hence long waiting times), but the stairs were convenient. The stairs are filthy however, dirt on the floors everywhere and be careful of the doors slamming shut. Never again would I stay here.","Dublin, Ireland",0,1.0

Having finally used Tripadvisor pictures on a tablet to show the difference, we were moved after spending our first night in the first room.Our room from then on was bigger but for some unknown reason had an exercise cycle machine in one corner at the expense of a chest of drawers (ironically the first room had one of these!). The only other problem was that the room was directly opposite the lifts, so people could be heard in conversations whenever they were passing / waiting.Ah yes....the lifts. They only hold 7 people at a time......WITHOUT LUGGAGE and there's only 2 of them. There's a Goods Lift but is used by staff for obvious reasons.

Instead, they put us in a tiny room with a king sized bed and a disgusting view and a loud airconditioning that we could not switch off. We talked to other people who also mentioned they had been put in the wrong room. So this is common practice at the Gallivant. Then, we were switched to our twin room, but the patio was not accessible. They reimbursed us 10 euros a night for this. Also, the rooms look very different than on the website. They are extremely small. False advertising. The hotel is not clean either. The cleaning staff does not clean certain areas. For instance, the area under the bed does not get cleaned. It was really dusty and filthy. Also, the walls in the bathroom do not get cleaned. There were several little hairs attached to the bathroom door. The staff also does not fill up the toilet paper. Very annoying! You don't want to worry about having toilet paper at night when booking a 4 star hotel. The shower is not easy to use, as you cannot choose how much water you're getting. You can only choose the temperature. The most filthy part of the hotel is probably the gym. I have never seen gym equipment look this disgusting. The treadmill looks like it has never been cleaned: there are so many sweat drops and filth on it. Also, two of the three gym devices, including the treadmill, did not even work... They charge you 2 dollars a suitcase to keep your bag for a couple of hours after check-out. Ridiculous. Lastly, and probably the most annoying part of our stay, were the elevators. There are only three elevators at the Gallivant, one of which never works. At certain moments, around 10 am for example, the cleaning staff blocks two of the three elevators, so there's only 1... Once, it took us more than 15 minutes to get down from the 13th floor. After that, we always just took the stairs...Don't waste your money on this hotel.",,0,1.0

Negative points are no engagement from staff... Not quite rude but just don't seem bothered unless selling you tickets for stuff. Rooms even for NYC are small. The toilet was hilarious... Im a US size 14 and just managed to get on the toilet due to it being in a tiny corner. The bed was OK but again just OK and definitely showing signs of wear. The room was adequate but didn't have guide as told it would and remote had half buttons working and AC was LOUD and all or nothing. We were on the 14th floor and even there the street noise was loud. The fire station is behind and every night it woke me at least once but to be fair my husband didn't wake. It was just clean as in I didn't complain but really could do with scrub of tiles and the AC needs a major clean up. THE REALLY BAD PART is the elevators.... Wow.... You could easily wait 20 mins for 1 at busy time and always at least 5 mins. 1 has been broken for 3 weeks and during room cleaning 1 is held for staff leaving 1 which holds 7 people for the entire hotel... And that's not including getting luggage up and down. We travel a lot and my honest advice is pay a tiny bit more and go over the road to the CROWNE plaza,,3,3.0

The room that we had was much smaller than what had been advertised and from then it really just went downhill. The shower is located right next to the toilet meaning when you do have a shower, you end up with a drenched toilet.

The room is dirty, and when I say dirty I mean it’s not CLEAN AT ALL. If not for the house keeper I can truly say I would’ve been out the first night. The only other positive is that the Beauty of Times Square distracted us from the ugly room. There is no room service meaning that if you do want to eat anything you find yourself wandering the streets constantly trying to make up from the poor service of the hotel. If after reading this review you still decide to stay at this hotel then be prepared for a $30 (nightly fee) which they only tell you about as You are checking out, which apparently is an ‘Urban Fee’ from the hotel.

The wi-fi worked brilliantly, the shower was great and the bed was comfortable. Location wise this is perfect: there is a good pub next door, a great coffee shop across the road, and you are only a couple of blocks from Times Square if you want to go that way, or you can avoid the hustle and bustle of it by walking up 8th avenue. You are also very close to restaurant row, and not far from the subway stations.We do have one complaint that stops this hotel getting 5 stars, and that is that the walls are very thin. This became a problem on our last night when the room next to us was occupied by a group of loud, drunk, obnoxious Americans who even before they started drinking FELT THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE WAS VIA SHOUTING. We rang the reception desk during the night, but they seemed quite powerless to do anything. And mentioning it at check out just earned an apology. Not the hotel's fault, I suppose, but still annoying.So as long as your neighbours aren't a bunch of loud-mouth drunkards, this is well worth a look.

Never before have I walked away from a hotel. But this time we were basically forced due to it being in a bad state and the hotel not being able to provide a room that was somewhat acceptable even. The rooms were supposed to be renovated but everything seemed kinda old and worn out, the furniture was far from new and the photos had been photoshopped. It didn't look like the photos at all. There was a problem with the heating where it wouldnt stop working, eventhough it was supposed to be on airconditioning to the point that it started smelling like it was about to burst in flames. Electricity sockets werent working and the rooms were really noisey. Not something you would expect for a 200 euro a night hotel. The way the ""management"" responded was very unprofessional, when it turned out that maintenance couldnt fix the heating isue the manager apologised but said that there was nothing more she could do and that we just had to deal with it. We are talking about a problem with the heating constantly blowing at full heat and speed. It felt like a sauna. Regarding the Wifi the modem was supposed to be reset and that should solve it, but it didn't. Then the manager tried to blame it on our phones since we all had iphones. Eventhough the wifi was working fine at the reception, but it wasnt on other floors, clearly making it a receiving issue. After having checked 5 different rooms which all had the same problems we decided we no longer wanted to stay and wanted a refund. The manager insisted that we would have to pay for one night, on which we replied that that would be fine IF they could provide us rooms that were acceptabel. With acceptabel we agreed that there would be no heating issue and the wifi would be working. The new rooms we got again had the same problems, so we wanted to go. Having spent 4 hours trying to get a decent room it was enough. Unfortunately the manager didn't keep up to her side of the agreement and still wanted to charge us for the first night. Which we don't agree with and still expect a full refund or an other solution. During the time we were complaining multiple guests came downstairs to complain either about the heating or wifi.

That was VERY annoying.Our room was near the elevator, so it got pretty noisy at times, especially during housekeeping hours (something to keep in mind if you come back midday with small children to nap).The elevators were small, and took a while to get there; we took the stairs whenever we didn't have our stroller with us.The breakfast buffet was at the Asian restaurant next door. It was good every day, and the owner was super nice.There were a few times that we called the front desk for various things, and they took forever to get someone to help us, and a few times even forgot.The location was good, right off of 8th Avenue, and pretty close to the heart of Times Square.I don't intend on staying again, since there are similarly priced hotels, that feel a little bigger in the rooms, a little cleaner, and the bathrooms don't get soaked when you turn the water on.","Ridge, New York",13,4.0

On arrival our safe was not working and I spoke to reception and they got straight onto maintenance and it was fixed within 10 minutes of reporting it.

Reception on arrival was luke warm, not particularly friendly or professional. Our first night was uncomfortable, the room was a lot smaller than expected for a queen bed. The mattress was very poor - lumpy and seemed well past its sell by date, we both had back ache in the morning. One of the bedside lights was working but the fixture was broken and just resting on the wall attachment. The TV was not working and the room was generally tired and in need of decoration and updating. The bathroom was very small and would not have been suitable for those with mobility challenges or people who are large in stature. The windows were filthy and we could barely see out of them. It was incredibly noisy so the glazing was probably single. We asked to be moved due to the noise and matress and were told that all the mattresses were the same. We moved anyway and were given a larger and quieter room and the TV was working. However, the windows were still filthy and there was a step immediately inside the room leading to the bathroom that we tripped over numberous times as there was no marking to highight the step - floor covering was the same throughout. The last time I tripped I scraped my arm on the wall and really hurt my big toe. We highlighted this to the reception stating that this was potentially dangerous for elderly or infirm. There was coffee provided in the room but no tea so we had to buy own own tea bags. The extra charges of nearly $200 was a rip off as this was for extra amenities that we didnt get, apart from water that we had to ask for each time at reception - the tiniest bottles of water. On a positive note, the towels and bedding were changed each day, the shower was great (although it did flood the floor each time and had to be soaked up with towels - a bit dangerous), the iron and hairdryer were both working well.

We had 9 nights booked at Gallivant and had been travelling for 14hours when we arrived to the hotel (exhausted, as you can imagine). Firstly, there is no heating in the building, including hot water. When I called the front desk about my cold shower and inability to warm up the room on a 11degree day, they said the building was over 100 years old and they didn’t have heating. Only old boilers which they don’t turn on? Furthermore; the bedding is inadequate as there is only light sheets provided. We shivered throughout the whole night and the bed/mattress itself was so uncomfortable I couldn’t even get in a position where a spring wasn’t hitting digging into my side. It should also be noted that the walls are PAPER THIN! You can hear every single conversation happening in the rooms around you, even the relatively quiet ones... But the worst part - the sirens, the garbage trucks and traffic noise coming from outside throughout the night! The hotel is old and outdated. The “air conditioning” in the room is a dodgy unit attached to the wall under an unsealed window. The floors are uneven and I actually tripped getting out of the lift due to this. The rooms are tiny (standard for NYC, but don’t expect a place to leave your suitcase! Everything about this hotel is tragic and outdated. We moved rooms once because of our neighbours drunkenly partying and yahoo-ing next door (which is insanely painful when the walls are SO thin already) so I can confirm this wasn’t an isolated incident and only applied to one room or floor. When I called the front desk in the morning (almost in tears after the worst night), I was told that they’d “allow” me to leave and they would refund me the unused portion. Whilst grateful that I was getting my money back (god forbid they withheld it!), I asked whether I could also be refunded for our first night given all the issues... The manager flat out refused and said he was doing ME a favour by letting me leave with a partial refund! I understand that we did occupy the hotel that night, however the issues were brought to the staff’s attention during our first room move and we had no choice but to stay by the time we checked in etc. I told the Manager that I’d be taking this further as we now had to book a new hotel (Crowne Plaza across the road which is AMAZING) and needed as much money as possible to cover that stay due to high cost - which he responded to in an arrogant manner “that’s fine” and hung up on me! We are still waiting for our “incidental fee” to be dropped/refunded also. The worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. I will forever have a bitter taste in my mouth due to the stay, but more the management. Don’t stay here... Simply, just don’t put yourself through it! It’s not worth it!

Room was grubby and our view was facing right into someone else's room (with what we thought was a privacy blind - don't be fooled like we were these are see through!).The ice machine in corridor was directly across from our room and the constant noise from it was unbearable along with our room shaking when someone else closed their hotel room door in our corridor.The bed was smaller than a double but it was comfy and sheets were clean.The windows were very drafty and we were unable to turn the heating on, only cold air.The bathroom again was tiny. Shower was good but water sprayed everywhere. Shower didn't drain properly.Wifi was average. Very slow at times, at others it was fine.We felt the basic cleaning in room wasn't good enough. Long black hairs everywhere (neither of us have black hair), feet were dirty after walking about floor, walls covered in dirty marks and the ice bucket was disgusting!Location was ideal for Times Square. Obviously it was noisy but you're in the centre of NY what else is to be expected :). Take an eye mask and ear plugs.I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you were able to get an extremely cheap room and didn't mind all of the things mentioned above. We weren't in our room much apart from sleeping so it didn't ruin our stay but I definitely wouldn't return to this hotel.The POSITIVES were: comfy (small) double bed, good shower, excellent location for Times Square, very pleasant staff (reception and porter) and the Chinese restaurant attached to hotel was great! These are reasons why we gave any stars on this rating.","Irvine, United Kingdom",6,2.0

The bed is comfy if a little small. I'm about 5'10 but anyone taller than me would be having chilly feet. The room is cosy. It fits everything but theres not a lot of free floor space so you'd notice an open suitcase. But you're out in the city all day so you dont notice the small room. The bathroom is gorgeous. We had no issue with hot water and the water pressure was sexy, I had a shower every morning!I dont know where people are coming from when they say the room was cold!! Ours was too warm of an evening so we stuck on the aircon for 20 minutes before we went to bed and that cooled it right down.The staff were friendly and helpful and we had very little to do with them. We left our bags with the concierge before check in for free and paid the 2$ per bag to mind them after checkout. Theres also a free to use weighing scales you can use if you're flying.There are two small elevators that only fit 7 people at a time. Now we only had to wait for a lift twice during our entire stay and tbh we could have just used the stairs only we were lazy so it wasnt an issue for us.

NO WATER in the hotel for a full day from 8am to 5:30pm (meaning no showers or flushing toilets) - completely unacceptable is a first world country.

Firstly it was very dirty - the window, the bathroom, the bed even had stains on the headboard. There was no character and it had much more of a hostel feel to it. The rooms look absolutely nothing like they do on the website!They even charged me an extra £75 which was an ‘urban fee’. I emailed over 4 times to be told that this would not be refunded.

We had been travelling all day with 4 children, 6 of us in all. Manager informed us card had been declined however the money had been already taken from my account . Manager advised that Booking.com had cancelled the room however when I spoke to a different member of staff at a later stage they said that it was the hotel had cancelled the room. My biggest issue was the treatment we received we had no room, despite it was paid for and there was no apology. The manager was quite abrupt and did not even look up when speaking to us. I have to say the room was lovely and it was clean and we slept well but the arrival to the hotel was shocking. My daughter was crying as she was so tired and thought we would have to go looking for another hotel. Why would a hotel give away a room that has been booked well in advance and paid for. My only guess is that the hotel was trying to make money twice on the room which is so dishonest. I would not recommend this hotel and I will be posting my update on TripAdvisor to day. Despite the manager saying there was no rooms left she did find us a room eventually and then we were informed we should be thankful that we got one when we complained.

I don’t think I got adequate heat once during my 5 days stay. Did think about complaining but having waited so long for a lift to reception, I just wanted to get out and about. Free bottled water advertised for your resort fee however twice they had none at reception. Bunk beds? Top one I did not believe was safe the sleep in as the guard was less than adequate. I wouldn’t let me 16 year old in it so certainly not a smaller child.Please do something about the windows, the noise from outside is as if the glass has been removed. This desperately needs looking at for a decent nights sleep. Our room overlooked 8th Avenue and the noise was constant.Pluses? Coffee machine cups and pods fresh each day which was brilliant. WIFi?

We looked around but there was no way of turning it off? No buttons on the unit either! We called down to reception where we were told that there’s a switch on the side to turn it off (I had looked there was no switch) So I explained there was no switch and eventually they said that someone would come up to have a look! so while we was waiting my daughter said she would have a shower only to find the shower only come out with cold water I then rang down again and they said please let it run for 10 minutes so after 15 minutes it was still cold so we left it and after 30 minutes it was still cold so I rang reception again and said this is unacceptable we have freezing cold water from the shower no hot water & the air-conditioning is on full and freezing cold so please can someone come up and sort this out! After an hour and twenty minutes later someone came up and accepted that there was no way of turning the air con off so he had to take the unit case off to disconnect a switch which was inside the unit!Then the shower was still cold so he said we would need to go to reception to ask to change room?We went down and was explaining everything to a gentleman on the desk when a lady came over who was listening & said very rudely “Oh Just give them another room it’s too much aggravation!” I just looked and said seriously she needs some lessons in manners! The new room was fine and the beds were really lovely that was a huge bonus! We had tv and WiFi & a coffee machine the shower was hot apart from 3 days when it ran cold due to issues that the hotel had but they then deducted the service charge for those days off our bill! To be fair the Hotel was in a fabulous location literally by turning right outside the hotel it brings you to Times Square So if you can put up with the downsides the plus side is you are in the middle of New York so you can get to everything so easy Having a comfortable bed really helped me get over the hiccups and as you only really need a clean room and a decent bed I was able to enjoy my holiday with my daughter for her 21st ,"Harlow, United Kingdom",8,3.0

So to start off with we arrived to a rude receptionist then when arriving in our room we was completely appalled at the size of the room and the state of it, we could hardly fit 2 suitcases in and still then the door was hitting off them, the wardrobe could not even fit my cabin bag in, we had no natural sun light, the air conditioning had to be turned of during the night because it was too loud even for one of my family members who is profoundly deaf so you can imagine the sound and the bathroom was so small I could just about sit on the toilet and my legs didn’t hit the wall by centimetres and I’m 5 ft 5 so you could imagine the problem my boyfriend had when he needed the toilet. We went straight to the manager and also found the price of our room went down from $2300 to $800 online so we went to explain how we wanted to be upgraded because our room was unexceptable and we was obviously ridiculously over charged. So we asked if we was able to either be given a refund because the confirmation says the hotel price matches if you find the room cheaper and if that wasn’t possible that we could be given free breakfast if they wouldn’t price match ,we was refused price match and breakfast. To add to this we was even told by the cleaners that “everyone moves rooms when they arrive because no body is happy with their room” and every passing guest that walk by in this moment agreed and told us the problems that they was having too. I brought this as a gift for my mother who is visiting for the first time and my boyfriend I spent $4600 for two “standard rooms” and I was upgraded to “king size” which the hotel told me I was lucky to get even though the king size cost $1200 by the time we was there so we still lost out over $2300 we have had an awful start to our holiday and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

In addition to this the door was broken, it kept catching and you had to force the door shut.We told the hotel employees about this on three occasions, all three occasions we were told it would be fixed or we would be offered a new room. This never happened. We utilised the safe in our room to keep our valuables safe, upon arriving back from a day of sightseeing we were unable to access our safe due to an error code. A member of staff did come up to fix this and I asked why the safe was broken she informed us that the passcode had been incorrectly entered too many times. However we had not attempted to access the safe all day. I became concerned incase the house keeping staff had not ensured the door was properly closed and someone may have entered our room and attempted to open the safe. I expressed this concern to the member of staff who quickly said it was an error with the safe however we still had doubts about this and asked about cameras in the corridor which the hotel DOES NOT have.

Unfortunately the positive aspects stop there for me. From day one I had to repeatedly complain about the WiFi being inexistent in my room; I was banking on this as the place where I could check NYC's map, where I was going for the day, opening times/prices for places I wanted to visit, weather app, WhatApp and other social media usage. I was told rather dismissively on the first day that, whilst yes, the signal was poor, it was probably because I had 'x' many browser windows open and had I tried to turn it off and on again. I found this very patronising, and frankly insulting to my intelligence, as it was clearly the WiF, not my phone. Nothing was ever done about it, and nor was I given any kind of apology about not being able to use the WiFi in full in my room even though it is included in the list of services paid for by the Urban Tax ($35 per day) charged at the end of my visit.I also remarked several times that the TV in my room was not working (it was essential the equivalent of watching TV in the '80s with a bad aerial signal); whilst I clearly did not visit NY to watch TV in my hotel room, I consider this to be a basic, so that I can watch the news in the morning, maybe catch a late night show before falling asleep, etc. For two days nobody came upstairs to check, and only on the third day (when I had finally given up and unpacked all of my stuff) was I offered to switch rooms, which I was reluctant to do anyway as I had no idea what other issues the new room would present, thus I thanked them and declined.The cleanliness of the room was down to absolute basic, I doubt anyone ever decided to sweep or vacuum under the bed, which had clearly collected dust from years of guests. (I only had the misfortune of noticing this because I dropped an earring and had to put my hand down there); also the bathroom was so small that I had to essentially play tetris to use it.If by mistake you'd like to sleep an extra hour one morning because you walked around so much the previous day and you are exhausted, forget it; the cleaners will make sure to shout at each other or down their phone from very early on, never mind a few 'do not disturb' signs.In short, a very bad experience for me, not worth the money.","London, United Kingdom",0,2.0

The hotel is small and does not have its own bar or restaurant, but there are two Asian restaurants with side entrances into the hotel that offer discounts to guests. The Japanese restaurant allowed me to order a wine to go that I could bring to my room. I was a decent pinot and was the most inexpensive drink I had the entire trip. Immediately upon arriving to my room, I got a call from the front desk to welcome me. The room was compact, but lovely with a contemporary motif. I had a junior suite, which included a loveseat, a work desk, and a private balcony. Unfortunately, it rained my entire stay, and as the balcony had no cover, I was unable to sit out there without a raincoat and umbrella. Shortly after arrival, I got an email asking me to rate my stay thus far. I noted that some of the lights in my room were flickering, some wouldn't come on at all, the door handle on the balcony was broken, the room was very hot due to what seemed to be an HVAC issue, and I was having trouble finding an outlet to plug in my devices. I went out to explore the city. When I returned, it was slightly cooler in my room (still very hot), the flickering lights had been replaced, and there was a new clock radio on the night stand with USB ports for my devices, but the door handle was still broken and the heater still would not cycle off. Because of that, I slept with the balcony door cracked to let in some cooler air and unfortunately heard street sounds all night. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.

The hotel has been ok. I had paid for an upgrade with BA to a Queen sized room, but was met with a tiny bedroom and a bed that was as small as my standard double at home, which was dissapointing. The mattress is a standard double but, it appears to be a queen base. The internet is rubbish, it works perfectly fine in the lobby but doesn't work in the bedroom (i'm in room 919). The shower in the room has been lukewarm on 2/3 of our days here and today, it is like ice cubes coming out the tap. I have questioned reception & requested that I be allowed to shower elsewhere but was told that isn't possible and that cold showers are a common problem here, very dissapointing as I have a long journey home tonight back to the UK and need to shower. The aircon in the room, whilst good, is extremely loud and therefore you can't really have it on whilst sleeping, as it either keeps you awake, or wakes you up, meaning you swelter. Despite the above, the staff are really friendly, especially Billy the housekeeping supervisor and the locality is fantastic, literally a 1 mimute walk to Times Square, Juniors, Hershey & M&M store & subway is on the next block.

On arrival, clean room (pretty small ‘deluxe queen’) but adequate for a 7 night stay in a busy city. Room was located on the front of the property. The room was quite noisy and again I expected that with it being such a busy city. The hotel is located around the corner from a fire station so expect sirens to be sounding all night. The location is great for the city and is walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. In fairness my partner and i only used the subway once during our whole stay. The rooms are clean and relatively modern with coffee and toiletries provided. I did have to request extra creamers for the coffee as occasionally the maid left us short and I also Had to ask for the hairdryer which was not provided in the room. The hotel has 3 lifts which were all working properly and we rarely had to wait to use them. The water was always hot and I know previous reviews have stated otherwise but we didn’t have an issue during our stay. On our arrival we were asked to provide a credit card (which we did) and were told that this was to cover any ‘damage caused’ to the room. We were happy with this as this is standard practice. We enjoyed our stay and checked out early for a 10am flight back to the UK on our last day. On check out we handed keys back in and we knew that there were no charges to be added to the room. On our arrival back in the UK my partner was charged £176 to his credit card ($230) When he queried the transaction it said that the card pin and signature had been used. At NO TIME did he authorise The Gallivant to charge this money to his account. We were not informed of this charge by the hotel or by BA. On reading reviews I have gathered that this fee is possibly a resort fee. The resort fee is used to charge for WiFi, gym and water. We didn’t used the gym, we didn’t have any water, and the WiFi was slow and extremely intermittent. The hotel website advertised “free WiFi high speed internet’ Which it clearly isn’t. We are now in dispute about the transaction with the credit card company. Be aware of this before you book or make sure you fully understand that these charges could be applied to your account without your knowledge. ","Dudley, United Kingdom",60,2.0

On checking in we were dealt with really quickly but was slightly alarmed at a huge school group hanging around the lifts. The staff quickly made sure everyone got in a lift and sent us on our way. The room was small but more than adequate for us as we literally wanted somewhere to sleep. Very clean and surprisingly quiet although the room was inward facing. My only moan really is the breakfast. We were booked as continental breakfast and it seemed to be in an adjoining Chinese restraunt. Very basic to the point of polystyrene cups and bowls. This just screams to me that they’re catering for the masses and don’t actually care too much about thier guests. I actually feel bad writing this as the staff were very friendly.

First impressions very nice and friendly staff. Get to our room and it’s small, compact and modern but we think it’s ok as it is NY and not much time spent in room. Location is very good. Air con unit is very dusty but not a huge problem.Went to have a shower and find that I’m aimlessly turning the handle and no water comes out. The handle is on top of the toilet tank!! Call reception to which they send a technician. He arrives and puts the handle back on.. he leaves and I try to turn the shower on. Handles falls off we eventually get it working and my partner goes for a shower.. same happens again!! We are not ones to complain but just laugh it off. Shower is powerful enough but the glass screen does not shelter enough so you basically walk into a flood/bath on the floor when coming out.Our friends staying here mention that there is a usb charging adaptor as I forgot my adaptor so I call reception and ask if it is possible to borrow one as our room did not have one. He abruptly and rudely said that not all rooms have them and this is not possible. I replied that surely as our shower handle is broken that maybe a usb plug was a small ask... he said that your shower is not broken the handle just falls off .. ok fine.... With high hopes I thought there might be a usb hole on the back of our dated tv.. no just layers and layers of dust!Just find it very bizarre that we paid the same price as our friends and our room is at least half the size!!Just wish they were more focused on making our stay more comfortable especially things that do not cost or put the hotel at a disadvantage.Would we stay here again?

The room was big and spacious with two bunk beds and a queen sized bed which was unbelievably comfy! Along with the normal facilities you would get in a hotel room. The bathroom was lovely too although I would suggest laying a towel down on the floor outside of the shower as it. can get quite wet as there is only one glass pane that doesn’t move. The location is amazing! I’ve been to NYC twice before but this hotel came out on top as it is so close to Times Square, you couldn’t ask for better. Subway is close too and so is a local shop along with a pub next door. So everything was literally at your doorstep. I’ve seen that people have complained about the fees that are required and I had also heard someone moaning to the receptionist about the fees too but I paid a holding fee at the start of the holiday and when we left and got back to London I was charged £91 in total for fees so I was happy with that considering from what I’d seen I thought it would be worse.

It has everything you need, you are in the heart of Times Square and close to everything. The rooms were always clean, although the room was slightly small, it was just a base for us, fresh towels every day, coffee is always refreshed (no tea unfortunately so take your own). If you want quirky places to eat just ask the reception staff who were always happy to help and recommend some hidden gems, it does have restaurants either side of the hotel and we ate in the Korean BBQ restaurant at least twice as it was lovely! There is free WiFi in the hotel which was great, please note that they do take $150 deposit on a credit card before you check in, this is kept until you check out in case of damage to the room. Also note that they charge a hotel tax of $25.00 per night per room so factor this into your spending money, this is paid at the end of the stay. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for a short stay to NYC. We would also recommend using the Top View Hop on Hop Off bus, it’s the easiest way to get around NYC, it includes the ferry around the Statue of Liberty which was amazing, night and day tours which are also amazing, it was $136 for two people for two whole days and nights, we got to see everything with these buses and you can get off or on wherever you fancy! NYC is an amazing place, I recommend going to the Top of the Rock to get the best views of NYC and get all your pictures. Make sure you go to M&M world it’s over three floors and lots of fun!Like I said New York is amazing and I’m glad we got to experience it, take lots of spending money (it’s very expensive) and make sure you tip, it’s a way of life out there. I hope my review has helped and I hope you enjoy this wonderful hotel and New York City as much as we did. Remember it’s London on Steriods! x","Portsmouth, United Kingdom",1,5.0

Bit the bullet and went for it anyway. Location is excellent, Times Square not even a 5 minute walk. Receptionist very friendly, nice interior. Room overall okay, modern design however definitely lacking a few touches- paint cracked and peeling on the skirting boards, felt tip pen on the white bed headboard?!, didn’t get a great view from the window. However these were only minor things, particularly as when you visit New York you barely spend any Time in your room. Only let downs were that one day our hot water was not working so my partner couldn’t have a shower, we did report this to reception who said they would investigate. The TV only had one channel which was news and that as an extremely awful picture, but again not major as we barely watched it. Only last grumble for me was the whole issue with city tax. The rate is $34 a day, which seems pretty extortionate. This is apparently for WiFi, gym and drinking water. The WiFi worked fine in our room, however we did not use the gym so not sure why I should be paying for this? Also the drinking water was not made known to us, only discovered on our last day that we could go and collect water from the desk- why not put it in the rooms and change it when the maids replace the toiletries? Upon arrival you are required to give a bank card for them to hold your details, was told no charge would be made. Upon check out the receptionist handed me a receipt for the city tax which they had already taken from my card. I didn’t mind as I would of paid this tax on card anyway, however I do think they should check with you first how you would like to pay, as people may want to get rid of their dollars on the last day. Also wanted to raise the issue that I wasn’t very happy about paying this whole amount as I didn’t use half of the services (water and gym) and one day we had no warm running water. A good stay, value for money but just keep in mind about the city tax, as it may not be great value for money by the time you have added that on top.","Birmingham, United Kingdom",0,4.0

After reading reviews on this hotel months before hand I must admit I was dreading arriving at this hotel. Its my 3rd time to New York but my fiancée's first so I didn't want anything to ruin it for her. There was absolutely no reason for us to be worried. on arrival into reception we were dealt with by a very professional bloke who only charged us the city tax fee and not security deposit that I have read that other people were charged. We were handed our room keys and went straight up to the room on the 5th floor. The room was so much better than I expected, you would think people were sleeping in the back lanes the way some people have went on about them. The room was very clean, bed was so comfortable, TV signal was perfect, Shower pressure was perfect allow we didn't have any hot water. the next morning I went down first thing to get this fixed and within 2 minutes of being back in my room the handyman was knocking at the door to fix it which was brilliant service. Room is a bit warm and the air con didn't seem to blow out cool air so I just cracked the window open slightly and it was sorted. People are right you couldn't swing a cat in the bathroom but luckily I left my 2 cats back at home so no issues there. Rooms cleaned everyday and towels refreshed. Location is absolutely brilliant.On the last day we went out for a few drinks before returning to hotel to collect our suitcases, i cant believe ive seen people complaining over the 2 dollars it costs per case, people just moan over anything.

The reception staff were excellent and efficient and the lady gave me a room on the 12th floor. I went straight to my room. Lifts were fine! So many people must be so impatient if they can’t wait for a lift for a minute or 2 like in all the reviews. RoomsMy room was clean and tidy. Yes they are small but this is normal for New York. It done the job and the bed was very comfortable. The rooms are basic (like a premier inn or ibis styles standard. I read up on previous reviews that they had no hot water. I had 2 hot showers a day and had no issues. Room was cleaned daily. There wasn’t much noise disturbance on the 12th floor just the odd Siren. LocationPerfect! Perfect!

We also had a blocked toilet which we asked for someone to fix it to return 4 hours later to it not done. Seemed to be a breakdown in communication between the front of house staff and cleaners/maintenance. Gym is as basic as it gets, a few free weights, a bench and 3 cardio machines.

The Tv's reception was very bad and the screen was always grainy and unwatchable.I would stay again, however only with a partner or by myself.

The rooms are not overly spacious, but they don't feel too cramped either (except for the bathroom). You are REALLY close to Times Square (which is great if you are seeing an evening show) and various subway stops so it was incredibly easy to get around. It is also a nice walk to Central Park and the many shops around there. It is directly next to a fire station though, so it was hard to sleep the first few nights as we were often woken by sirens (couldn't believe how many would go off in 1 night!). However, we did get used to it. Personally, if we came back to NY we would stay in another part of town, such as Soho or Brooklyn, due to the sirens and the fact that being so close to Times Square got old quite quickly (it's hectic!).

Check in was quick. Man on the desk had a bit of a chat wished me a merry christmas so i explained that it was my birthday first. He asked when so i told him to find out the other guy who was with him on reception was the day after mine. Asked for a credit card for the hold charge and that was it, all checked in. No other charges were taken due to me booking a package with british airways. My room was on the 13th floor. I had booked a single room as it was just myself and i was only sleeping and showering there. Room was small. Had to sit with my legs on the bed to open the wardrobe each day. It was clean untill i found a few ants crawling around one morning before i went out. Simply poured boiling water on the source and i didnt see any after that Room had a heater that was noisy but had to have it in cool all the time as the room was so hot. Im usually always cold so dont usually find that a problem but the heat was too much for me. Room also had its own balcony. Not much of a view but it was ok for me. The door was slightly stiff and didnt close properly like there was a slight gap in the frame almost like it had been sprained at the hinges. Didnt find it an issue though as i was on the 13th floor. It was very noisy due to the location but for me that added to my experience and once id turned the lights out and blinds were down i was sound asleep from being busy all day anyway. Maids came each day with towels etc but no toiletries. I always take my own just in case but none were replaced when used. Location is fab. 5 mins walk from all the the glitz and glamour of times square. Easy to find the hotel from 50th street station when traveling from the airport by subway. Upon checkout i left my case and rucksack with the bell man for 2 dollars per bag. He asks what time you'll be back to collect and then threads and chains them around the sofas in reception and secures with a padlock. Asked if i could print my boarding pass but the printer wouldnt print. After a few mins playing around and using a different programme to open the document i finally managed to print it out. Although the lady on reception said if i emailed it to her she would print it for me if it didnt work the second time around. Couldn't have asked for more really for my first time in new york. Id stay here again as i had such a positive experience overall. Im one of those people who isnt picky about places unless it really deserves to be brought up. Just go and enjoy yourself.

This room was unbearable, so we requested another room, which was not available. The staff were apologetic, but not helpful in resolving our problem. Although the hotel is non-smoking, somehow they failed to check the room and clean it before we checked in. We wonder if they even cleaned it or changed the sheets. They said they would charge the previous residents for smoking — however, this was no help to us. Luckily we were able to secure a decent hotel room at the Hilton down the street, or we would have been stranded in the city with our children. DO NOT take a chance with this place.

The check in was quick and easy. The staff were attentive and friendly. Yes the rooms are small but when visiting new York does anyone really go there for the size of a room? An absolutely fantastic location right next to times square. We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel which was a great start to our day. Am American style buffet filled us both right up. Rooms were cleaned every day with fresh bedding and towels changed every day. A nice late check out at 12 midday and also you could store your luggage safely for a small fee of $2 per case. Again.....I can't express how friendly the staff were. Always a good morning and a smile when we came down.......Even down to them ordering our taxi back to the airport which arrived ahead of time and waited for us until we were ready.Would 100% stay here again,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom",1,5.0

The receptionist was pleasant enough, however, she only booked us into 1 room (two couples)! Upon realising this, we had to go back down to reception to sort it out(not what you want to be doing after travelling for 18 hours). The guy on reception wasn't very helpful and even tried to argue we had only booked one room - even though our paper work showed differently. Eventually we got it sorted out, however, the reception staff were very short on giving information and didn't explain the debit card bond situation very well. All in all, not a very professional start.The room was clean and tidy - nothing flash, but for a budget hotel not bad with all the amenities and coffee making facilities and a secure safe.

Our family from Germany flew in to share the holidays with us here. When we arrived and came through the front doors, the lobby was very updated and beautiful. That excitement quickly turned to horror as we entered our room. The most upsetting part is that I am not the only one who complains about these issues; yet the hotel does nothing about the following issues: we had a broken dresser. If we open one drawer, they all opened and then would come off track. We tried to fix them. Did not work. After a closer look-- all furniture looked like rejects from Salvation Army. The photos attached show very worn furniture, however, my photos do not capture how bad the furniture truly was. My husband was going crazy after seeing many exposed wires hanging out throughout the room and no wall outlet plates. Whenever one of us would shower, the water would flood the bathroom. (They did fix this). Also, when one of us showered, there would suddenly be dozens of bugs flying around us and climbing on the walls. The housekeeping staff said it is normal. The bugs come up from the drain. Throughout our room, there was peeling paint, wall holes, wall knicks, broken blinds, and some of our windows did not open correctly. Also, there was missing floor in some areas and in others, the flooring was overlapping one another. We had broken and/or missing baseboards as well. Ok. Ignoring all of the esthetics, it just got worse. We could not even relax to watch TV. The TV does not swivel--it faces the broken desk. To watch the TV, you must sit in the ""one"" old, uncomfortable, breaking desk chair. If more than one person wanted to watch TV, we had to take turns sitting in the ""one"" old, uncomfortable, breaking desk chair. Mind you, we had a Family Room for 5 people. To have to share a chair with 5 people is plain ignorance on the hotel's part. We paid for a large room with 3 beds; yet we could not watch TV at the end of the night and we are paying about $600 a night. This is one of the stupidest decisions I have ever made in my life with regard to wasting money. Because our stay was during the holidays, we were held hostage. There was no where for us to go. It was extremely maddening. We had children. There was no way for us to avoid our room and stay out all night. Also, after 6 hours of walking around every day, we wanted to relax and watch TV as well. How the hell to do this when the TV faces the east wall and our beds are on the north and south walls? Remember, the TV does not swivel. The thought that went into this ""boutique"" hotel were extremely trivial and uneducated. I recommend staying at a chain hotel so that there are standards that must be met or the staff is held accountable.","Menifee, California",18,1.0

Lovely welcoming hotel and staff nice modern decor, room very clean and comfortable and attractive, bed and linen very comfortable, shower great although sometimes did take good 5 mins to warm up once we realised this was ok. Lovely soft clean towels, didn’t use coffee machine would have been nice to have had provision of tea bags as we don’t drink coffee. Great provision of travel adapter we actually went out and bought one before we realised! We were on the fourth floor in a deluxe room we didn’t feel it was small, just right was on main road was a bit noisy but it’s New York people and round the corner from a fire station it didn’t particularly bother us we were too busy out having fun and shattered when we got in, husband complained about the noise of the AC but he always does and I need it on so that’s not a criticism whatsoever.Helpful staff especially Antonio on the desk I asked him if he could recommend a steakhouse which he did and took into account budget and he actually booked a reservation for us and advised on taxis and cost and we had a fabulous evening at Jacks Steakhouse as a result thank you :-)Handiness of the Irish bar next door was great for us as a nice base to come back to and we ate here on the last night and the food was nice and plentiful although disagree with putting 20% service charge on EVERYTHING.Location of hotel is perfect for exploring New York we had a great experience would definitely recommend to others. Our friends had the penthouse suite with a balcony overlooking the road which was wow factor but we preferred being lower down so could go up and down stairs and didn’t have to rely on lifts although there were 3 of them and pretty quick but our friends felt they had to wait a while to get up and down.One tiny gripe we had to pay residents tax outgoing whilst our Expedia reservation said included all taxes and surcharges and this was taken from our credit card, I would have preferred to have been told that, the cost and the option of paying cash when we checked out instead.Liked the lemon water provided on the desk and the provision of ice machine on our floor and the noon checkout was also great thank you for a lovely stay","Bolton, UK",81,5.0

After spending 10 minutes in line for assistance, the receptionist was totally disrespectful and dishonest with me. I asked for help because I had a reservation with airlink NYC, and since the streets around was closed because new years eve, I needed to know my new pick up point. so I asked the receptionist to call them for me and he just said “I can’t do it, can’t you see the line of people waiting to be assisted?”, I was outrageous since I waited in line FOR TEN MINUTES BEFORE MY TURN. So I tried to explain to him that I had only 5 more minutes before the shuttles departure time, and he just said that after check out, the guest is not the hotels problem anymore and yelled “next guest”, totally left me out talking by myself, I felt embarrassed, mistreated, it was horrible! So I asked him to call the manager, he did. The manager came, and apparently tried to help, but did nothing with the receptionist who humiliated me in front of everybody at the lobby. At the end, who helped my boyfriend and I, was the guy (asian) who kept our luggage. He helped us to figure out and call to the shuttle company. Shame on you, Gallivant! You should traine better your staff. I will never stay with you again, nor the people I know in Brazil and trust me I know millions of people back in my country.

On arrival, we were greeted by a beautifully festively decorated & presented lobby. This was then followed by welcoming and friendly hotel staff. We were told on arrival that we had been upgraded which was lovely. We then went up to our room which was on the 9th floor. It was very clean and tidy and much better than most of the reviews I have read. It was also a good size given that you are in New York! I have seen a number of reviews complaining about the lifts, however, we didn’t experience any issues. There was the one morning they were busy but the stairs were easily accessible and it didn’t take longer than a couple of minutes to get down to the lobby. We were very busy on our trip so we didn’t get much time to eat at the hotel, but the restaurant on the side was great to pop in to and have a quick beer and nibble before venturing out for the evening. When it came to the departure, we had to leave the hotel at 4:30am and I was a bit concerned we would struggle to sort getting to the airport and finding a cab. The gentleman on reception that morning was extremely helpful, and called us a cab which arrived straight to our front door. It was really smart and reasonably priced too. The receptionist really did help to make things a lot less stressful that morning, so thank you. The location of this hotel is perfect! Broadway and Times Square are easy to get to within minutes, it was so easy to find somewhere to get dinner in the evening. Apart from the airport runs, we only used one taxi whilst we stayed here and that was to get to the piers - we walked the rest.So take the negative reviews with a pinch of salt, we had a truly magical time in New York and the Gallivant definitely contributed to this.Thank you :-) ","Hartlebury, United Kingdom",2,5.0

The price was almost too good to be true and so we didn't expect much. We travelled to this hotel via subway from JFK (well, you have to take an air train out of the airport first) I think we paid $5 for the journey. It took approximately an hour to get to the hotel this way as you have to change once or twice, but it wasn't too difficult as we didn't have much luggage and the walk from the subway was little over 5 minutes. The hotel itself is very close to Times Square, again, little over a 3-5 minute walk. The view wasn't fantastic, I think we just about caught the side of M&M world, but then, you get what you pay for. The room was a little on the small side, but adequately supplied. We did find that the door caught on the floor when you tried to shut it, and the shower rattled, so we got the overall idea that it was a bit cheap, but then...so was the price. We didn't particularly like that the duvets on the beds didn't have a cover, but they were merely sandwiched between two sheets. This might just be an American thing, but we didn't like it. The rooms, however, were modern and there was very little street noise. Most places were within walking distance of this hotel, with the Empire State taking less than 15 minutes (although we are quick walkers) It was also surrounded by subway stations that led to anywhere that may have taken slightly longer. We didn't have much interaction with staff. We weren't greeted at the hotel, but the man at the check-in desk was pleasant enough. The Wi-Fi is also very good.

We have stayed in many of the moderate-priced hotels in the immediate 4-5 blocks of the Gallivant. The Gallivant's location is superb! The beds are very comfortable and things are reasonably clean without being spotless. That said, you must understand that the Gallivant is a converted old welfare hotel with rather dingy hallways, and doors that slam when being shut. This hotel currently seems to cater to large tourist groups, so be prepared to pick your way through a lobby filled with milling people from tour groups and littered in every corner with huge suitcases tied together. The 3 elevators are often slow or in use at the top part of the building. We stayed in 309, and it often was more convenient to walk down. Specific to 309: the view was of the ""tenement"" side of the next door building, but it was delightful to be on the quiet side of the building rather than the noisy street side. If we stay here in the future, I would probably request a room further away from elevators and the morning housekeeping racket. All in all, our stay was pleasant enough, and definitely beautifully located.

The room was really comfortable, small but you’re not their to stay in the room all the time. Now for the bad. I paid extra for breakfast, but unfortunately I ended up eating out every day, the first day was because we had an early tour and breakfast was served until 0700. The other days were because it’s a continental, that’s probably partly my fault as I never read that properly, but I wish I had never paid for the breakfast at all. There was one particular day our room wasn’t cleaned and we had to locate our own towels and take our litter out. There is three lifts in the hotel, and at least two of the days there was only one working lift with queues of people waiting for them, leaving us to walk a couple of times, the day we checked out the lifts were down and we waited for about 20 mins to finally get one down. Lastly, there is an additional charge on top of what you have already paid, I believe it’s about $25 a day. I did know about this, but only because I had done some digging.

We book the Standard room and it brings a full size bed which is just a bit small for couples. The room has ants and it has water flies in the shower. Less then sanitary, to say the least. Again, back home, humidity is the cause for shower flies. I would not stay here with a child and definitely would not stay with a family.The only real positive on this hotel is the location. You are a block away from Time Square. I have learned and continue to learn that we have to stay in Chain hotels which seem to have better rooms and amenities.The sad part is I went to front desk every day to move to at least two twin beds so my husband and I can sleep better and they kept telling me they were fully booked but booking.com says otherwise....On a different note, nothing to do with hotels, use taxi service instead of uber and lyft.

We requested a twin room and received an email confirming this from the hotel itself however were given a small double. The hotel dismissed me (politely) asking to change rooms despite me showing the email. We were told we’d have to wait two days for another room to become available. The whole time we were dealt with rudely by the reception staff with one woman exclaiming ‘do what I tell you’ when I asked what we had to do with our cases to switch rooms. The foyer is lovely upon arrival however you soon discover the rooms are not reflective of that. They are small, which is understandable given the location, however I have stayed in other 3* hotels in Times Sq. and The Gallivant has some of the smallest rooms I have seen. Perhaps most disconcerting, though, is the dustiness and general dirtiness of the bedrooms. Both rooms we inhabited were disgusting in terms of dust under the bed, grime and the state of the air conditioning unit. Both my friend and I suffer from asthma and we were both ill the entire duration; something that other guests have also commented on which does not surprise me as the air unit looked ancient and the room constantly had a weird dustiness to the air. There are also too few lifts for the number of guests - we waited over 15 minutes for one one day as they only allow 7 people in each lift and there are just two for the whole hotel. In all, I would not recommend staying here unless location is absolutely paramount. ","Newark, New Jersey",97,2.0

Beds were comfortable though. Decor was tasteful. AC did not work in room 1428- which made the room 80 degrees all night- very uncomfortable. Lobby/front desk-nice staffThe lobby was overheated and overcrowded. 2 skinny elevators are inadequate for 15 floors. I think there must’ve been a front desk issue on Dec 7- unhappy people and luggage filled the entire lobby for the entire day. We did not have front desk issues, but it seemed that was not the case for most people, most People could not get into their rooms well after check in time and some got there early. The lounge/computer area looked like it was roped off with chairs still up? There was water available in a dispenser with ice but no cups. The ice machines were broken on most floors, only 4th floor worked. Location-1 block to Times Square- very convenient to everything. Bars/restaurants right next door. Parking- Ritz Icon parking garage directly across the street- $45 per day if you got your ticket stamped. We had no problems parking, but others were lined up the street blowing horns on our checkout day, so not sure what was going on with that, other than it was Saturday? So maybe we were lucky checking in on a Friday and getting out early on Sat? Anyway, for the high price, I would not recommend staying at the Gallivant. ","Pottstown, Pennsylvania",162,3.0

We found this hotel and thought it looked smart and booked it. When we arrived, we were given our key and went to our room where we were not impressed with the size and appearance of the room. First thing was the size as it was very tiny for a couple to stay in and manoeuvre around the bed. Next was the large balcony door that was opposite the bed with a large frosted window that let in too much light. Not to mention that there used to be a blind but looked to be torn off or removed so we were woken up at the early hours by the light. Another thins to note is that this hotel sits on the same road as a fire station, so in the early hours of the night you will get woken up by fire engines. We should have been told about this upon arrival so that this was something to bare in mind. The breakfast in the hotel was mediocre, just a bit over priced for what it was in the hotel when you can go down the street to another place for cheaper and a bigger selection. The location, you can’t fault it. Around the corner from Times Square, the gray line bus tours and walking distance to other attractions. Lastly, I was asked to put a $125 deposit down for the room in case of anything had happened to the room. We left the room tidy and everything to a standard for the cleaners to come and change the sheets etc. I was promised that I would be getting a deposit back in 3-5 days. It has been well over a week, and I haven’t had a single word from the hotel, and no sign of that money. Even contacting them via the website is bad as you will not get a response.

This was my first time in New York, I stayed with my friend to celebrate us turning 30! The location was brilliant, really close to Times Square and Rockefeller Centre etc and the lobby was lovely and Christmassy! The check in was really quick and the staff friendly but it took a while to get up to the room as the lifts seem to stop on every floor and are really small. The room was compact but we were out most of the day so it wasn’t a problem. The bathroom was lovely, great shower. And there is coffee in the room, TV and hairdryer etc. Our room seemed really clean and we came back to it having been cleaned each day and fresh towels. The only real issue we had was on organising transport to the airport at the end of our stay. We had asked reception the day before leaving, what the best way to get to JFK was (as we had flown into Newark on the way there). We were assured they could book us a cab no problem, and we didn’t need to book anything in advance as a taxi could be there within 2 minutes. So we spent our last day enjoying the city, but arrived back to the lobby packed with people complaining that their taxis hadn’t arrived! When we asked reception to book us one, they said there are no taxis available, so I explained what we had been told the day before and he told us to go out on the street and hail a cab. Being two girls on our own, on a Friday night with our luggage, we didn’t fancy this! Eventually we spoke to the manager on duty who was really helpful and she managed to get us a car, but it cost us more than we were initially quoted and was an anxious end to our trip. We would have been happy to get the train, but as reception had told us it was so easy for them to get us a cab we didn’t look into other transport options!

The lobby is spacious and makes for a nice entrance, however that's where the positives end.The negatives - The heater in our room was broken and blowing cold air until we managed to get staff to fix it after a long argument over it supposedly taking time for the 'old building to heat up'. The water supply is cold in an evening and takes 10 mins to actually warm up prior to being able to take a shower.

I had also booked (by phone) a double twin bed room since my 18yr old son was w/me, they gave me a king room instead saying ""sorry, someone extended their stay & they're in the room that you reserved"". The hotel is quaint and central to everything, they just need to fix a few things (you can tell maintenance is an issue as all guests were complaining) & give you the room that you reserved.","Richmond, Virginia",68,3.0

When I booked this hotel via Jet2 I opted to pay for room and breakfast. To add breakfast for 2 people for 4 nights cost an extra £189 so I thought rather than go out searching for a restaurant in the morning It would be more convenient to eat in the hotel and head out from there. I was given coupons from reception which I had to hand in to the restaurant before breakfast. the first morning I handed in our coupons only to be told that I was only entitled to a continental breakfast. I explained that I had pre paid for breakfast and was expecting a full breakfast. Waitress explained that in order to get a full Breakfast I would need to pay another $10 per day. Without wanting to cause too much of a scene I gave her $10 and found a table. To my surprise the full breakfast was a few tiny sausages. scraps of Bacon and cold scrambled Egg. The following day we just had continental. on the final morning I was eating my Breakfast, and I was interrupted by the waitress who asked me why I had got cheese. Bearing in mind the cheese was 2 slices placed on a saucer and wrapped in cling film. I said I was just having the continental Breakfast. She then told me that the cheese was not included in the continental Breakfast and then took it away from me and put it back on the Breakfast bar. I found this very embarrassing and confusing. To me a continental breakfast always included Cheese/Ham/ Bread etc. The breakfast is very limited at the hotel but to be honest I never went hungry. However you can opt to pay for breakfast at the hotel which would have been a lot cheaper than what I paid. Moaning aside. I thought the hotel was fine. the rooms were small but clean and adequate to be honest. could not fault the location as its right In the heart of times square. Would I go back? Probably, but I would not use the restaurant for breakfast as it just wasn't value for money and the staff have really put me off with their unprofessionalism.","Durham, United Kingdom",3,3.0

We were allocated a room on the 15th floor which had 2 double beds, 1 had disgusting stains around the base cover and the other was sagging in the middle. The radiator cover was cracked and looked filthy and the sofa cover was stained with goodness know what. I couldn’t have slept in that room as it looked filthy on first inspection so I wasn’t taking the chance on what may have been lurking on the mattress! When we asked if we could change rooms the guy on reception actually sniggered and said there was none available. The duty manager eventually sorted things out by issuing a full refund so we could be on our way and find another hotel. To top it all the lift doors stuck on the 15th floor when we went back up to the room to get our cases so we had to press the floor below to get out! The reception staff need customer service training and you don’t pay good money to be patronised or made to feel you’ve done something wrong by refusing to stay in a filthy room.We were asked to email the duty manager with our complaint which we have done.

Glad I didn’t. Stayed 5 nights. The reception was clean and modern and decorated for Christmas, the staff were welcoming. Check in was easy and the room was ready early- 2 hours before their stated check in time. The lifts were slower than some but on 11 out of the 12 times used it wasn’t a problem. Didn’t eat here so can’t comment on food. Coffee pods in the room was good but the powdered creamer was disgusting so get some fresh milk! Our room was on the 12th floor and must have been refurbished as it had a modern contemporary feel to it. Spacious room with en-suite shower room. Large walk in shower. Miniature bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion- no shower gel but I’d seen the reviews so taken my own. Towels were replaced every day and were only bath towel size rather than bath sheet size , but there were hand towels too. Personally would prefer a larger towel! The room was very warm and the air con was noisy and unit didn’t look the cleanest so didn’t want to keep it on in case it was harbouring germs. The windows were probably over due for replacement, we left ours open a fraction and you could hear street noise but we were in Times Square and you soon blocked the traffic noise out. The bed was comfortable, sheets replaced every day, it was an average double, but not complaining like others have. TV had poor reception but I wasn’t there to stay in and watch TV. Standard things in the room were there, safe , hairdryer, iron and ironing board. Overall a very good hotel experience. Clean and comfortable. Check out swift and the bag storage was $2 per bag for the day. Location was fabulous. New York brilliant. ","Chesterfield, United Kingdom",4,4.0

We asked reception if we could move but quite frankly they were uninterested just kind of sniggered when I asked if that was the best room available and then said they would call the manager to sort it out. After persuasion the duty manager did process a full refund as the hotel was fully booked however it spoiled our initial arrival and especially the parting words from reception saying ‘have a great birthday & don’t let this spoil things for you - start afresh tomorrow in a new hotel’ beyond belief!

Nice touch I thought, then we were told we had been upgraded to the penthouse, which was a wonderful gesture, BUT when we got on the lift a staff member was also in the lift when we told her we were going to the pent house she said "" Oh did you complain before hand?"" So what was a lovely gesture then made me embarrassed.( I wasn't going to but this on trip advisor but why would you say that to Someone) Any way the room its self was vey nice big bathroom balcony with wonderful views. The second night my partner proposed to me , when I said yes he went to try and get champagne and the hotel could not supply (just a little word of warring) so he had to go three block to find an off licence. The third night I got up during the night to use the bathroom , to find the bathroom was flooded , we called down to reception and were told someone would come and clear up , no one appeared and instead we had to use the towels from the bathroom. We also had trouble with Ants but again we dealt with this our selves. We had to get the maintenance team to come and look at the patio door as the handle was broken , this was fixed while we were out for the day. This hotel will always hold good memories for me as it were my partner proposed, but I think a little attention to detail can go along way. The maids were wonderful and do a really good job we left shortbread and a tip each day with a thank you note, we met a girl in the lift who was Dutch and she thanked use for the shortbread as she said it reminded her of the sweets she eats back home.For Future visitors all I would say is yes this hotel is in a great location and probably the main reason they are so busy.

If it wasn’t the lack of hospitality and professionalism that started out this not so great experience let me add the rest here so you all will be aware. Paint missing on the walls, temperature control system looked and sounded like Sanford & Son sold it to them (It was a 70’s unit that was barely able to keep the room cool and it was November), the carpet rug looked as though it hadn’t ever been washed in a decade and it was fairly new, waves inbthe flooring, windows nailed shut, and the greatest fail can in two areas, instructions when I booked over a month prior to the visit included being away from the elevator (nope, out the elevator across the narrow hall) and there is a club or something just outside the only single pane window that blasted hard core hip hop dance with intense bass way past 1am on a Friday night. I can deal with most NY attitude when I’m on the street, but not when I’m paying for a service or product, I can deal with cramped small rooms in Manhattan but then keep them clean and tidy, I can deal with some noises off of Times Square and in the city but when I call to ask about it, and it’s not adressed, not one once but twice when I called and you try to tell me Bruce Springsteen’s musical just let out and the volume should come down but doesn’t after 3 hours and you say it’s hip hop dance music to only get a response that Bruce has become “progrsssive” is s a sheer tell tale sign the hotel is a joke. I called, I wrote, I even addressed all of these at check out and NO ONE said or did anything. Lastly, DO NOT waste your money on the shuttle service to the airport. They are late and slow and take every possible route to avoid tolls and was only $5 less than a LYFT! (Lesson learned!)I can’t see myself staying there again. There are too many other options that treat their guests with honor and professionalism. Lastly, the beds are ok.

The hotel is in a good location very short walk to theatres subway and restaurants. Rooms are very compact and noisy (from aircon and traffic). Bathroom is tiny barely room to stand up. Rooms are in desperate need of being upgraded, they are poorly fitted out with old damaged furniture. The safe in the fitted cupboard is at a ridiculous height that only someone above six foot tall could reach. I had to move the bedside table to stand on to put my belongings in the safe, wish I hadn't as the dust and dirt underneath was disgusting. Under the bed was as disgusting, do the cleaners actually clean in this place. There was no chest of drawers to store clothes and only 5 coat hangers between 2 people. Bed was comfy enough and sheets were clean although stained in places. Staff seemed pleasant enough and concierge was very helpful. wifi only seemed to work in hotel lobby which made it very busy and difficult to get to lifts. Lifts are very small which makes them extremely busy in the mornings when heading out for the day. We didn't use the luggage storage as it was not secure, they were chained together in the hotel lobby in full view of other guests.

The room was compact but had everything you needed although there was a strong damp smell which I reported on our arrival. I didn’t think the staff were overly friendly. The aircon unit was old and noisy. You could open window so the aircon has to be used to cool room down and mask smell. The bed was comfortable and linen was changed each day. It would have been nice to have shower gel supplied as I had to buy some. I personally wouldn’t return to this hotel due to the lack of follow up regarding my complaint. I also advised that this trip was to celebrate both mine and my daughters birthday. I received an email to say they had noted this but we received nothing on way of this. The hotel lobby is beautiful and concierge was good as they held our bags once we had checked out. It would appear that this hotel is used by a lot of school parties as there were a number of separate parties there during our stay. To sum up this is a small functional hotel with comfortable beds perfectly located but lacks the personal touch. It’s ideal for a ‘base’ nothing more. ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom",10,3.0

The internet took 12 hours to redirect us to log in, the first room we were offered was small, pokie and the heater smelled like there was something being barbequed on it. It also looked like some one had tried to break into the room with a crow bar, the room number was 527. I complained and we were switched to a different room 627, which the room was about 8ft wide with 18"" of a gap on the left and on the right there was about 9"" because of the heating unit. The bed is too small, for a hotel that charges $250 per night, I wouldn't expect my feet to be hanging off the bottom of the bed, in fact the bed was just an every day, run of the mill, double bed. The head in the shower was too low, when i used it, I had to remove the head to wash my hair. The bath was an old tin bath, with a enamel chip at the back, which someone tried to recoat but to no avail. The noise was horrendous from the hallway, there has been no effort to reduce the noise from the doors slamming, try sound proofing on the door frames, maybe. The fact that the health and safety of the hotel has to be in question when the cleaning trolleys were left in the hallway and with half filled rubbish bags. To top it all off, when we checked out it was absurd that we were charged $8 for storage fees for 4 cases, for them to be stored insecurely in the lobby........

Local room tax was deducted on arrival from the card used for any room expenses and in our case, not the card on which the booking was secured, this was not explained at reception on arrival and when we asked if we could change the card charged we were told no, very unhelpful. As I said room had coffee making facilities but no tea available from reception and at $5 for a box of teabags at the local deli so had to make do with decaf coffee and not everyone likes coffee. Bathroom was so small that the floor got soaked everyone you had a shower. Not sure if it was value for money as it was booked as part of a package. Not sure I would stay again.

You cannot fault the location. It’s right in the heart of Times Square and close to Central Park, Rockefeller Centre and the Empire State Building. The free wifi worked very well. When we arrived early, the lady that checked us in could see we were very tired and keen to get into our room, so she upgraded us which was very kind. The room was ok, basic. Good shower and nice shower amenities. The bad...My partner and I both work at the Four Seasons, and so we know what great service is and we expect it wherever we go. Even if the hotel is not 5 star, the service should ALWAYS be 5 star. The bathroom did not have a fan and the window could not be opened, so it got extremely steamy and soaked all the towels in the bathroom every time we showered. We had to shower with the bathroom door wide open. The housekeeping fiasco was ridiculous. When we stay in hotels we always choose to put the do not disturb sign on the door until we go out, at which point we call the front desk to ask for housekeeping service. We did this on the first day, and the front desk said yes it would be done. When we got back to our hotel room that evening, the room had not been serviced. I called the front desk and they apologized. The next day the exact same thing happened, I couldn’t believe it. The front desk gentleman said he would put me through to the manager. It went straight to voicemail, so I called back and the front desk guy suggested that tomorrow I should come down and tell the desk when we want service rather than calling (what on earth is the difference?!). A couple of days later, we left our room for the day at around 12.30pm and went by the desk to ask for service. The front desk guy gave us a rude look and said ‘we’ll try’. I asked what the problem was and he said housekeeping only runs until 12pm. I have stayed in tonnes of hotels and have NEVER experienced one where housekeeping finishes at 12pm. What a joke! But also, why on earth did nobody tell us that the first two times we called to complain our room hadn’t been serviced?! Later in our trip (we stayed for 7 days) our room was serviced twice without us asking AFTER 12pm, which was great, but does housekeeping finish at 12pm or not? Was the front desk agent just lying to us? The housekeeping lady (Asian lady with short brown hair) was quite frankly a nightmare. Our do not disturb sign was on one morning, I was stood in front of the mirror doing my hair, when suddenly I hear shouting through our door - ‘do you want service today? Do you want towels?’ I thought she couldn’t possibly be talking to us because why would a staff member shout through the door to a guest, especially if that guest had a do not disturb sign on the door? But the shouting carried on, so I opened the door and there she was. I looked at the do not disturb sign, looked back and her and said please can you come back later. She was completely oblivious.Another couple of times, we had the deadlock on (as we always do for safety) and she knocked once then opened the door STRAIGHT away (seriously, have these people received no training? What if we were undressed?) then shouted through the locked door asking if we wanted service. We were still asleep!!!The phone operator was terrible. Couldn’t answer basic questions and had to put us through to the front desk every time, even when we just requested towels. The operator seriously can’t request towels for us, they have to put us through to the front desk? She also answered the phone each time with ‘operator’. No name, no ‘good morning, how can I help’, nothing. Then she’d put us straight through to the desk without saying anything. Just terrible. This is really basic stuff that the staff clearly haven’t been trained on, or just can’t be bothered to make the effort. We called to ask for two bottles of water and were told we’d have to go to the desk for this, they would not deliver them. Really? The front desk staff were so unbelievably rude. We had seen a sign on the concierge desk saying we could purchase show tickets there, so we went down one evening around 7pm to find nobody at the concierge desk, so we went to the front desk. A gentleman there (didn’t get his name but he was a back guy with a bald head) asked what we wanted and we asked if concierge were around. His reply - ‘no. Why, what do you want?’ I said we were looking for tickets. He said ‘what tickets?’ I said show tickets. He looked at me like a was a complete idiot and said ‘why don’t you just get them at the box office?’ I could not believe it. I have NEVER been spoken to like that by a member of staff in a hotel. The staff at this hotel need some serious training on how to speak to and treat their guests. The only staff member I ever saw with a smile on their face was the lady who checked us in. We were not made to feel welcome whatsoever, and not only do they not go above and beyond to help you, they don’t even do the bare minimum. I’ve seen the manager’s replies to some of these reviews saying that this is not their standard and they always value their guests and have a high standard etc. But we were there for 7 days and saw absolutely no evidence of these high standards, so exactly what does the manager think his staff do to make the guests feel valued and welcomed? Shocking. ","Whistler, Canada",2,2.0

The hotel is off the main strip (about a 10 second walk!) so it isn’t too noisy and disruptive at night. Our room was a premium room so very spacious with a nice bathroom. Also, a fridge was included which was very useful.Housekeeping and staff were very friendly. I also used the gym which was fine, if a bit small (only 1 treadmill, bike and cross trainer). It wouldn’t be possible for more than a few people to use at any time. The only few bad points; loud outside in the morning (I think either deliveries or bin trucks?) but not the hotels fault. The breakfast was poor quality and a bit expensive for what it was. If you want an American breakfast, better to walk a few minutes to Juniors. Even though the room was decent, it was a bit tatty with broken furniture and some broken lights.

The room was fairly basic but clean and tidy, despite being a premium room I had to ask for a fridge to store my medication as there wasn’t one in the room when we arrived and it took a couple of requests to get the second bunk closed so my daughter wouldn’t bang her head if she woke in the night and wasn’t paying attention. That being said the beds were comfortable and We had no problems falling asleep. The TV kept losing the signal but as we were only really using the room as somewhere to shower and sleep it wasn’t a big deal, so I didn’t bother to report it.The only real bugbear for me was the elevators which seemed to take forever to get to the ground floor and only accommodated 7 people at a time, if you got to the lobby when others were waiting for the elevator you could find yourself waiting a while.In terms of the location you couldn’t ask for better, a minutes walk to the centre of Times Square and all that entails.

I have sent a third email questioning an additional charge to my credit card, even though Booking.com states clearly that all taxes are included (including city tax) and still no answer, I also emailed the hotel directly.................guess what...no answer!!!This is a great shame, as apart from agreeing with comments regarding room size being on the small size, the hotel was okay. Great location, clean rooms , and most staff were friendly(not all) . However, even though i asked at check out if there were any other charges and was told no, they rob my credit card, this is unacceptable, regardless of the amount, which could have been much higher, you have no control of what they decide to steal from you.I rarely give poor reviews, but this has left me with a bitter taste. I have also contacted Booking.com as they are also misleading customers regarding fees.I would never recommend this hotel due to this now. Be aware, they are happy to take your money without prior knowledge, and totally ignore any form of communication.",berkshire,15,3.0

Great location. Great price. Only stayed 1 night but walked to/from 2 Broadway shows, Times Square, restaurants, etc. I've stayed in several NYC hotels so wasn't surprised at the small room size despite it being a premier room. Couldn't check in because computers were down, but went to lunch next door instead which was wonderful. When entering the room, there was a fake eyelash on the floor and the kids were mortified. I just kicked it out the door. Bedding is white and shows everything but I still felt confident it was clean. Toilet was running which didn't bother me, but did the kids so even though it was 11 PM it got fixed by a pleasant guy. If you were a person who stayed in their room 24/7, I would say this is not the place for you. But, we were there less than 10 hours which includes sleep and it was fine. Just need a place to nod off in the city that never sleeps! Parked across the street at a public place and got a hotel rate which I was about $45 for 24 hours.","Ellerbe, North Carolina",6,3.0

It was very clean, had a nice TV, and a comfortable bed. The location was great because it was so close to Times Square and Rockefeller Center.

Our room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for 2 people. The cleaners did a great job and supplied clean towels every day as well as making the bed and cleaning the rest of the room. There was a big wall mounted tv, a nice desk with chair, wardrobe and in the bathroom a really nice shower with different settings like 'massage'. Something we're not used to in the UK! All the staff were very pleasant to deal with and every bit of the hotel we saw was clean and had a quality feel to it. My only criticism would be our particular room didn't have a very good view but in a hotel with so many rooms they obviously can't guarantee a decent view with all of them!

This is especially true if you have tickets for a show. We went to two different productions and were at the theatres in around 5 mins. In the room, the shower was good and the bed was comfy. The hotel also lets you print things like tickets and boarding passes for free, which was good.Negatives: The room was pretty pokey; the sort of room where the doors always won't open fully. It was very hot in the room and the air conditioning was very loud and too strong. The main issue we had with the hotel was the hidden charges. Booking.com gave us an estimated cost after all the odd taxes American hotels charge but the amount we were charged was in excess of £50 more than that. We could have stomached this if they then didn't charge us another £30+ after we checked out for an unknown reason. We searched their website to find possible reasons for this but couldn't find anything. When I contacted them twice for an explanation, there was no reply. It left an unfortunate sour taste in the mouth after an amazing trip to New York.Conclusion: The hotel is ok but you could get better and cheaper. We thought a Times Square location was important but New York is so easy to walk, cycle or subway around that we would recommend staying elsewhere.","Southport, United Kingdom",62,2.0

The cause was they only had one accessible room left, yet our rooms had been booked in March. Also they had given the previous guest a late checkout for medical issues? Late checkout until when? According to the Hotel check in is 3pm. We arrived at 6pm with our unwell disabled adult son who had to lie on the hotel couch in the foyer and go to sleep while waiting 2 and a 1/2 hours for his room.

There was no shower stool/chair and there was a huge stone, pointed basin where if my son fell he would have seriously injured himself.The lip into th he bathroom at the doorway was inaccessible for him to access in his wheelchair.

It is close to Times Square and various restaurants, bars, and theaters. We were lucky enough to see A Bronx Tale at Longacre Theater two doors down. On our way over we stopped at Hurley’s next door for appetizers. We were only disappointed that there was not a mini fridge in the room to store and chill our bottled water, snacks, and left overs during our 3-night stay. But we had a small cooler we brought just in case. Parking was easy in the garage right across the street. It was valet, and you just need to be sure you pick it up on time to not get charged an additional day (they communicate this well).

I would not recommend it to others considering booking a room there.Not everything was a disaster. Above everything, if one is visiting NYC for Broadway, it’s a brilliant location. Every theater is within walking distance. Other positives: the towels were great (new?) -- refreshed daily and fluffy. The hotel offers a 10% discount at the two adjoining restaurants – our meals there were good. The in-room coffee packets were replenished every day too – that was appreciated.Unfortunately, the disappointments were significant. First was the “resort” fee of $28+ a day for…something (wi-fi? Exercise room? Lobby computers?). IMHO, the Gallivant is anything but a “resort”. The extra $28/night was a means to increase the money paid while keeping a competitive price displayed on-line. (Sort of like the airlines charging for a seat assignment, checked bags or a ‘fuel surcharge’…) That resort fee added 11% to the daily room rate.The room was a postage stamp. Even by NYC standards it was tiny. I’m 6”1’ and I banged my head on the bathroom door handle when getting up from the john (sorry if that’s TMI…) The distance between the bed and the window wall was 18 inches. I measured. The floor is a faux wood laminate – no rug or carpet. No table/work station. One chair like you’d see in a banquet hall – and stained fabric on it to boot.While the towels might be new, the bedding/mattress was not. It was marshmallow squishy. The sheets were under-sized and wouldn’t tuck-in. One awoke almost swaddled in the sheets in the morning. Boo.A little thing, but the in-room clock would not reset. I looked for five minutes to find the change-time button, and failed. That might be on me. My solution was to unplug the rascal and use my phone for my alarm. The elevators were scary. Slow, and it went up when you wanted down, and down when you wanted up. We were on the second floor so we used the stairs except when we had luggage. The fire department was even called one evening to rescue guests who were stuck in one of the elevators for 30 minutes. Yay stairs.I don’t know if it was on purpose or just lackadaisical staff, but there was a linen cart left in the hallway at the same spot our entire stay. Maybe it was so guests could get additional towels if needed, or an extra soap. I thought it odd that it never moved. Dangerous maybe if there had been a fire (or… if the elevators stopped working?...)The icing on the cake is that when we checked-out on the 3rd, “the computers were down” and our final invoice couldn’t be printed or displayed for review. The front desk said to leave my email and the final bill/receipt would be sent to me. Today is the 5th, and two days after our departure, that final invoice hasn’t yet arrived. I don’t know…maybe the computers are still down.Our stay at the Gallivant was disappointing and we will not be returning…ever. There are too many other $250 - $300 night hotel options in NYC near Broadway to go through that experience again.

One day the bed was left unmade but the $4 dollars was taken. 2. I found a black slimy insect slithering on my towel on the first day. 3. No shower gel provided, luckily we had our own. This is the first time in all my years of travel that a hotel has not provided this. 4. No milk for the coffee or water provided despite hot weather in NY. Again, we have never experienced this in any hotel before. 5. The concierge refused to make a call to the shuttle company confirming our pick up time. We were directed to use the phone in our room. I tried it and it wasn’t working! I had to use my UK mobile phone which cost a packet. 6. The air conditioning was SO loud we didn’t get any sleep all week. It was horrendous as we were so tired every morning and this impacted our ability to enjoy the sights. 7. The Chinese people running the limited breakfast buffet agreed and wrote a price for us for the week which I paid on the first morning. On the last day we were told, despite showing my receipt, we owed more money. Every morning they looked at us and started speaking another language, then they would peer at each thing we ate making us feel guilty if we went up and got something else to eat/ drink. Further, the bread was stale snd it was upsetting they did this. 8. Extension sockets with wires next to bed as the hotel is so outdated, there are no sockets for laptop or phone etc next to bed. 9. Television had about 10 limited channels, unclear picture and wonky on the wall. 20. Narrow hallways with cleaning trollies that are left there 24/7 and have to be negotiated to get to the lifts which take so long to arrive. When they do, they are always packed! 22. Nowhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom. So small you can’t swing a cat in there. I spoke with British Airways as we came here for a rest/ recharge as a family member has cancer. We feel worse/ more tired than before we came from lack of sleep from the noise. Staying here caused us more stress. We explained this is definitely not a 4 star but more a 1 star hotel. The decor is outdated and any attempt at updating the lobby is tacky. Our room was something I’d expect in a third world country.

The hotel in general isn't as clean as it could be and is looking very run down. The staff in the hotel especially the reception staff were anything but helpful in actual fact they came across quite rude at times. They didn't seem as though they wanted to help us at all. I enquired straight away about the upgrade we had paid for and was told quite abruptly that the room we were given was the room we booked, I beg to differ as on returning I have looked the website for the hotel and our room was nothing like the one we thought we had booked. The only person who seemed to want to help was a gentleman at the concierge desk when he obtained a taxi for us.

Ideal location if you want to be centrally located. Even thought this hotel is just off Times Square I was not facing the main road so was never disturbed with traffic and generally outside noise. Pleasantly met by the reception staff. Check in was quick and effortless. There is two lifts that appeared slow so we're always waiting for a lift to arrive. I opted for the larger room which I'm pleased I had as I had the chance to see the smaller room and think I would of been dissatisfied when staying for several nights. My room had an ensuite shower room. The bedding and laundry were clean and appeared good quality.

I complained that I was cold in my room and that the heating would not turn on but was told the heating would not go back on unless the temperature dropped to a certain level, it was February and it snowed, so I was wet and cold!!!!The location is great, so close to the theatres and times square, all within a very short walking distance. This suited me really well.The room was compact but we had a reasonably good city view. Usually we have looked out on to other building when staying in New York, so this was a real bonus. The bathroom was very small but adequate. No chairs in the room, there was one wooden stool/round table. had to lay on the bed to watch the tv, but the remote wouldn't work from one of the beds. We spent our spare time in bed, keeping warm but my bed had broken springs, so was very lumpy. On investigating the lumpy bed, the mattress was stained and the cover dirty-good job I only did this on the last night. urghh!!!t Beds were not made up every day but we got clean towels daily, trash was taken; and they replenished drinks.We did not eat in the attached restaurant for breakfast, as it seemed pricey at $20. We got cheaper, good breakfasts elsewhere.The reception area looked nice enough, with lots of seating but as mainly busy so not a place to sit and relax. The whole hotel is looking a little tired but ok enough.I wouldn't stay here again as I ;like somewhere to rest up in comfort as I find New York very tiring on the old legs and back. However, if you want somewhere good for theatres and Times Square and don't spend much time in your room, this would be ideal: if they change the bed mattress and bedding$2 per item of luggage is charged if you have a late flight home and don't want to trail your bags/cases around with you.

The hotel is in an excellent location, just off Times Square. The hotel itself is quite modern, the foyer has quite a boutique feel. I read other reviews saying it felt tired and run down but we thought it was fine. The reception staff were fine upon arriving but not overly welcoming or friendly. Bad points: Our room was tiny. The windows were dirty and we could barely see out of them. The air conditioning unit was incredibly noisy so couldn’t be left on overnight which meant it got very hot as it was too noisy to leave the window open. We had a water machine on our floor but on the first night it was out of order and beeping, which we could hear from our room. We called to reception to report it and they said they would send bottled water up and also someone to look at the machine. An hour later, nothing. I called down again and was told by a rather rude member of staff that they were short of staff so would not be sending bottled water but someone would come look at the machine. Another hour passed and still nothing! It never got fixed while we were there. We were on the top floor so used the lifts but there is only three and they are small and slow. One broke down while we were there. One morning it took us about 10 minutes to get down because it took a long time to arrive then was going down, and then going back up to higher levels before it reached the bottom. We eventually got off on a different floor and took the stairs.The lady on reception when we checked out was quite curt, did not ask how our stay was etc, just took our room keys and confirmed we were checked out. Good points: The hotel is very clean. Our room was really clean (except the windows!). The room was well equipped with a hairdryer, iron/ironing board and an adaptor for U.K./European plugs. The cleaning staff were lovely, so friendly and cheerful. As we didn’t spend much time in our hotel it did not affect our trip too much, but there’s definitely things that could be improved!","Surrey, United Kingdom",5,3.0

Whilst there are a few positive points on this hotel there are a number of issues which would be easily resolved which let this place down. First we arrived around 9.30pm after hours of delays with our flight and were met by a miserable, extremely rude member of staff at the reception. She didn’t explain anything to us and just threw our room key down, stating the room number and shoving a piece of paper to us. Didn’t provide any information about the hotel or our stay. We got to our room on the 10th floor and I have to say considering it’s in the centre of Times Square the room was not that small, it was a reasonable size for 2 people for a 5 night stay. There were a number of amenities including a coffee machine, an iron and ironing board and an ice bucket for the ice machines located on a number of floors. In the bathroom there was also soaps and a hairdryer. The biggest downside to the room was the air conditioning unit which is essentially a whole in the wall with a unit too small for the whole placed inside leaving a gap under allowing a lot of noise and smells to come in from outside. The worst part was the noise that the unit made even when switched off, it made it almost impossible to sleep. This hotel is also situated just a few doors down from a fire station meaning you can hear the sirens all borough the day and night and with the windows so thin and the gap under the air conditioning unit it can be very loud. We had a massive issue with the water temperature in our room after the first day. The way in the shower, sink and even toilet was boiling hot. We had the maintenance guy come up who was very nice but all he did was leave the water running for around 10 minutes and flush the toilet and few times and then said it was fine. This meant whenever we wanted any cold water we were having to leave be water on for around 10 minutes and continuously flush the toilet, we would then get some cold water for around 5/10 minutes and it would go back to boiling hot. This left us almost burnt a number of times in the shower and when trying to wash our hands etc. I had read a lot of reviews mentioning the lifts and until our last day we didn’t have a problem. On the last day I believe one of the lifts was out of service therefore it took a long time to manage to get into the lift and walking up 10 flights of stairs numerous times wasn’t the best situation.On a whole I do wish I had chosen somewhere else to celebrate my 21st, I feel that in many other hotels something special would have been done on the day of my birthday and the hotel was informed by my boyfriend previous to arriving asking if there was anything that could be done that he could pay for, however we was ignored and nothing was done to acknowledge the special occasion. The lack of sleep due to noise became a real issue during the stay and whilst I appreciate you are in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the world and it will be noisy there are steps that could be taken to reduce the noise such as getting rid of those ridiculous A.C units and having better windows fitted. There are certain members of staff that could also do with some customer service training. In saying this there were some members of staff who were very pleasant such as the cleaners that we seen and the lady on the concierge desk who arrange a private car to take us back to the airport pretty last minute which cost us $65 and was all round very helpful and pleasant. I don’t think I would choose to stay here again due to the lack of sleep and some of the staff. However it is in a great location and within walking distance of so much. If you don’t mind a few rude people and are not a light sleeper then this hotel would suit you just fine.",United Kingdom,8,3.0

Unhelpful and unprofessional staff. Asked for a receipt for the tax I paid and was shouted down by the woman at reception who wouldn’t even listen to what I was asking for she just shouted me down and completely ignored me. I have a hunch it was to do with our age as while we sat in the lobby waiting for the taxi we witnessed multiple people check out and they were polite and helpful with all older customers but were increcibly rude to us. Left the hotel crying in the taxi on the way airport at how the disgustingly rude and unprofessional staff had made me feel throughout the stay- ruined my 21st birthday present.

After asking to be moved, we found that the entire side of the hotel had that issue. We were told we could move top the top floor and the other side but there wasn't any tv signal above the 7th floor?! We had no choice but to accept because the sound proofing was terrible as it was.

It was easy to find and close to a few major subway stops. The location is perfect! A 30 second walk from central Times Square! And 10-20 minutes walk from many major sights - rockerfellla centre, Empire State Building, 5th Ave and Grand Central. Lots of amenities close by like shops for food or quick snacks. Loads of bars, cafes and restaurants nearby too - next door and the next streets. So it was perfect for this side of things! The hotel itself is pretty standard but fine, it has all you need in the rooms - towels, shower gels etc. Great tv channels! It was clean, the beds are comfy and warm. We had a deluxe bed and it was pretty massive for the both of us so we had so much space! The staff seem helpful and it has some quirky features around the reception! Sleeping isn’t amazing when there’s loud music from Times Square or neighbouring bars but you can get over that and it only really affected us on one evening. The rooms aren’t massive but you don’t spend that much time in there so it doesn’t really matter. I’d stay again :)",,20,4.0

They were clean and the coffee machine is a nice touch. There's a fitness room in the basement which is handy. We were also able to leave bags on our last day for a small fee. My only recommendation for improvement is that the heating / cooling units and pipes can get a little noisy but not enough to disturb sleep too much.

The hotel is perfectly located with theatres opposite and a few doors down as well as in the surrounding streets.

The hotel itself is pleasant enough, although the rooms are small and dark and the shower room incredibly small. Nevertheless we were warm and comfortable and the room was clean. Sadly our safe was out of action, and despite the efforts of the maintenance team, could not be repaired. Fortunately we were able to use the one in our children's room. They were given a free upgrade to a larger room with twin beds. The staff were polite and helpful, keen to sort out problems if possible. There is a Chinese restaurant leading off from the lobby where you can get breakfast at about $19 for a full cooked option or less for the continental version. We found local coffee shops that were cheaper and a corner shop where you could buy pastries for $2. Our experience was very positive in this hotel and I am a little surprised at the negative reviews on here. I would stay here again, and found it good value.

It was a Premium Room. In short, this is a very tired hotel which is in need of maintenance and decoration. Save for the lobby, the hotel is not kept well. We raised two serious maintenance issues and both were fixed promptly (so top marks there) but they were the kind of faults that shouldn't have occurred at all, and had the cleaning been half way thorough, would have been obvious to the housekeeping staff too. All staff were very friendly bar two Reception team members who seemed hassled so difficult to know if they were just having an off day. The hotel is very noisy front and rear, even for NYC Times Square; soundproofing is way below other hotels in the area. Bed was very comfy so if this is simply put your head down for few hours, and you can sleep through most external noise, this is a decent choice of hotel. Location is good too as easy to access most key tourist hotspots on Manhattan from here. The Chinese restaurant attached do an okay breakfast and if you will commit to more than a day at a time they will do you a deal on the buffet rate of ~ 25% discount. The family room design gave my 9 and 10 YO some private space which is nice, but I am out of positives at this stage. We wouldn't go back to The Gallivant, but we have stayed in worse. Its value for money for Times Square, but for a few dollars more, you can do much better e.g. The Manhattan Hotel.","Wellington, United Kingdom",31,3.0

But as many have said on here, you only stop here for sleeping! Overall I was quite impressed.. After travelling for over 8 hours we arrived to a pleasant lobby area, we checked in and had to pay $100 for city tax ($25 per night) which needed to be on a card.. thankfully I used monzo! So we had a room on the 5th floor and despite having a lovely(!) view of a wall from the window the room was pleasant and clean- there’s 4 lifts, which yes are small but at one point there was 8 of us in a lift.. but what do you except in the middle of NY? Upon arrival the gentleman at reception gave us a piece of paper detailing the city tax, check in and out times, WiFi code and how to use the room telephone (if needed)The heater.. so this made a lot of noise but once I got to grips with using it it was fine and I had managed to opt for the “heater” function which didn’t utilise the fan so reduced the noise aspect.There was a door in between our room and next doors which is maybe used for families who have children to provide a double bed and 2 singles (we had the 2 single beds) it was lockable which couldn’t be accessed from the other room but at times was a little off putting due to noise and hearing talking from the other room. There was a safe in the room but we didn’t use this - just use your case with a lock instead! The bed was super comfy, two pillows and just the right tog for duvet for both myself and sister.. tv worked perfectly fine, shower; was a power one, nice and hot! The one morning we woke up late but the housekeeping service knocked the door offering to change the towels, which were clean, no marks and this was changed daily. Had toiletries: shampoo, conditioner, soap and hand lotion readily available within the bathroom, with a hotel hair dryer hanging on the bathroom door in a bagThere’s an option for $2 per bag to keep in the hotel on your last day so you can finish off exploring before catching the plane. We opted for the airport shuttle, again ordered on the day of departure, this was $65 for 2 people and 2 suitcases and pick up time for us was 4.25pm, it was early but took just over an hour to get to JFK (due to rush hour) but if you’re tired I’d recommend this! We caught the airtrain to Jamaica then E subway to world trade centre to get to the hotel upon arrival which took around 1.5 hours so about the same (again during rush hour) Overall, if you’re wanting a cheap, good location hotel and not fussed about fancy add-ons this is the one for you.. you only use a hotel to sleep in and refresh before exploring NY which is exactly what we did.. the location is perfect for accessing everything in New York with the subway being on 50st and 49st just off Broadway..

We complained to front of house, two staff basically said.... it's an old building and they are noisy, this is New York. They offered me ear plugs and if we wanted to move rooms but said a lot of the rooms have the same issue and they couldn't tell us which ones did or not. They were pretty rude also. We were also charged some random scam/tax that other people have mentioned on reviews. Nothing being mentioned at reception about them charging as we had paid in full. In Europe that is called Fraud.

I went down and complained at the desk, the staff don't seem to care at all, not even an apology... the man that I spoke to said that there was only one other deluxe queen left and moved is to that room. That one was even worse, it was absolutely filthy! I went down to ask to be moved again and was told I would have to pay extra which I was not having. We were eventually moved again after a lot of negotiation and the room for the remaining two nights was acceptable, although not very clean again.

The location was good for us because we did things uptown, downtown and midtown. Check in was uneventful; room wasn’t ready early which was ok, but the front desk lady wasn’t very friendly and when we placed our bags with the bell hop, we were charged $2/bag in cash. Which I assume covers his “tip”. I always tip bell hops but this requires you to do so. Weird. As other reviews have stated, our room was small too, the bathroom was very tiny and the view was through a dirty window, but we can handle all this. It’s the elevators that irritated us. There are only two guest elevators with a max capacity of 7 people and one was out of order. So the wait time for a ride down 8 floors was very long. We took the stairs but a lady in high heals isn’t very happy to start the day like this. Breakfast is served buffet style in the adjoining lobby restaurant Ding. Lots of stuff to note here. The quality is low budget buffet quality, but the price is $19.99/person? However, the lady who poured coffee approached us to propose a deal for our breakfast. If we agree to come back again, she would charge us $16/person. Had to pay her in cash as well. Again weird. Finally, check out was uneventful and we had an evening flight out so we put our bags back with the bellhop and again paid him $2/bag. We booked the hotel shuttle with the concierge, and were charged $60, again in “cash” so back to the ATM. We were told pick up was 3:25 pm. We’re waiting in the lobby by 3:20 when we were abruptly scolded and rushed out to the shuttle by the same concierge and when I boarded the packed shuttle was again scolded by all the passengers that had been waiting for us. Not a nice way to end a stay. I really understand hotels and resort fees because they include perks and amenities and while on vacation I appreciate those nice touches but I didn’t get any nice little perks here. It seemed like everyone was out for their own little scam. ","Hinsdale, New York",90,3.0

I was nervous about what to expect given some of the reviews here. Don't believe everything you read! I booked a shoebox with twin beds which was fine for one night. This hotel is in the Times Square area, off the beaten path a bit. It's about a 15 minute walk from Grand Central. The lobby was beautiful and fancy. We were checked in right away and were told we would be ""upgraded"" to a room with three beds for free. Yes the elevators are small and European style. Maximum capacity is 7 people! We only had a few small bags as we were only staying overnight.The 9th floor is very nice. We had a corner ""premium"" room with one set of bunk beds and a queen bed. The bunk beds are built into the wall and can be folded up when not needed. We had a bit of a tough time folding up the top bunk by ourselves but it stayed put halfway up! The room is very very nice. The wall was decorated with a nice map of the area and the bunk bed half was separated from the queen bed area by a half wall (the bunk beds are against this wall). Both sides of the room featured a window with city view, 2 windows on the queen size side, individual climate control and each side has a TV. The beds are made in white linens with multiple pillows of varying softness and a plump duvet. The beds are very comfortable. The windows have double shades and you do have to look closely to find the pull chain on the left of the window to draw the night shade down. Otherwise you get lights from the street below. Once the shade is closed, the room is dark. Climate control worked great. We put the air conditioner on when we arrived and then shut it off at night. My sister put the heat on in the morning when she woke up. I thought the heat was too much. The room also featured a small closet with safe and plenty of space to hang our coats and a coffee maker and coffee.The bathroom was kind of hard to find. It was hidden in the corner of the room across from the Queen bed. The bathroom was quite nice. My sister loved the shower. It's a small bathroom but fit ""fluffy"" women just fine. My only quibbles are that the wifi didn't seem to work and since we both had phones with data plans, we didn't call the tech support number and ask. Also, the elevator floor was dirty with food wrappings and such in the evening when I went to get ice. We had a very nice stay. There are a couple of theaters in the area. Wicked was about 2 blocks down and Once on This Island is next to Wicked. My sister took pictures but hasn't sent them to me. If she does, I'll add them later.",Rhode Island,82,5.0

The computers are there to print off tickets and boarding passes they take great care of your luggage on the last day for next to nothing and it's clean. It's so central to everything and there is a little sweet shop a couple of doors away for snacks in the room. Bathroom is tiny but shower was amazing. Bed comfy and although quite small everything you needed was there. Heating is their only problem it was boiling!! New York was mild in weather while I was there .. I wasn't able to turn it off but I played with the dial and could stop it blowing BUT the windows opened in our room so it didn't bother us and we just listened to the city and cooled down that way. We forgot some items and they were found and logged with lost property etc. When I called them they started to arrange them to be posted but luckily a friend collected them in the end. We had one night of banging doors and hallway shenanigans and the staff there couldn't have been more apologetic and helpful about it. I would stay here again!

We got to our room (202) and was disappointed to find it was tiny and very very dark! To get into the shower, you had to stand over the toilet breathe in as much as possible and try to close the door, only then could you get into the shower. When you did, it flooded the entire room as the glass pane didn't cover much of the splash at all. In order to get into the bed I had to go from the bottom and climb up as the aircon/heating unit was immediately at the side of me. Because of the lack of room there was a clear lack of cleaning as the floor was covered in layers and layers of dust! We tried getting into the safe which was locked, called reception and was told only the manager has the codes to unlock them and he/she wouldn't be in until 9am the next morning so we had to carry around our passports/money etc with us around the city. As I say, the room was extremely dark, for some reason the lights are situated right in the corners of the ceiling and not in the middle and so the walls were slightly lit up, but nothing else. It was such a depressing room! We couldn't even open the blinds as we were overlooked by other rooms and you don't want your neighbours to see you with no clothes on and I don't like to look at brick walls and tarpaulin. We went to reception the next morning and asked to switch rooms, the only one they had was 227 on the same floor, it had the same view but thankfully I didn't have to close the door to use the toilet or shower and I could walk around to the other side of the bed! The shower still flooded the bathroom every-time leaving you with constant wet towels but it was somewhere to sleep. This hotel is classed as 'luxury' and I must say there is nothing luxury about it, you even have to pay to hold your bags in the storage room once you check out, EVEN AFTER PAYING ALL THAT MONEY FOR A ROOM!The hotel was in a great location I think that's the main highlight.","Nottingham, United Kingdom",17,2.0

There was plenty if space for my luggage and the bathroom was mire than adequate. Staff were always friendly and helpful and the room was cleaned and towels replenished daily.

Five of us stayed in the family room, number 714 and the room was exactly as pictured online. I found the gallivant through my travel agent shoreluvtravel.com and we booked it through bookings.com. It was super easy and the price was amazing for a room in Times Square! The description was accurate and I was very happy with the hotels interior throughout and more importantly the size of the room. This room is perfect for groups of friends or families. There was a good amount of space and a huge bathroom with double sinks and mirrors. It was fine for 5 girls to get ready! The beds and pillows were comfortable. The only downside was that this room did not have a good view at all and we were thinking it may have been over dumpsters because when we opened the window it smelled really bad! We were on the 7th floor so not too sure but once the windows were closed the smell was gone! The room was very hot when we arrived but we just waited for the AC to turn on instead! Not a huge deal!

I was with a large group therefore didn’t have a choice over the hotel. I have visited New York before and my honest review would be this is not the location I would choose...expect to here sirens, tooting, fire engines all throughout the night. This hotel also seems a heavy favourite with school trips - so that may be something you don’t fancy being roomed next to!On the surface the rooms are extremely comfortable. The bed, pillows and linen are great quality! The shower was great but you do have to let it run for 10 minutes until it turns hot. Once you’ve spent your first night you do start to notice the upkeep isn’t to a high standard, there were lots of marks, cracks, scuffs on the paintwork and didn’t feel overly fresh or clean.There is no plug socket near the bed, which was annoying. Having to charge your phone overnight at the complete opposite end of the room on the desk. The air con/heating is a huge boxed vent in the room, which is extremely noisy when on however it is a better alternative to opening the windows and the noise kind of drowned out the traffic noise.There was no fridge in my room, therefore the milk provided was powdered, not an ideal way to start the morning. Facilities in the room are good - iron, hairdryer, safe etc.The room is made up everyday - although I did return early to find a maid sat at my desk using my iPhone charger to top up her battery. There are only two lifts in use at the hotel and only allow 7 people at a time. They’re extremely slow, it also doesn’t help this hotel is oversubscribed by schools, so you are often waiting for a whole school to have gone up and down in 7s before you can get in yourself.

Reception staff very friendly and found them easy to talk to, once we arrived to our room which was located on the 12th floor our first thoughts were the rooms are a lot smaller than they look online, but it suited our needs who go to NYC and spends all their time in the hotel, room was very clean and we always came back from our days out to a clean room, the cleaning staff are brilliant, the downside to the rooms are they don’t come with a fridge which I find a nice thing to have as my wife and I always bring back water to the hotel room so would be nice to keep it cool, maybe this is something the hotel could invest in, however I can’t knock the hotel room itself, we found our main problem was the use of the lifts, they either seem to come straight pass the level you are on and you are left waiting for a while or they don’t come at all, both lifts had broken down on 25/2/18 so we had to use the stairs and as people were coming up and down the stairs which are so narrow it made it even worse, after our day out the lifts seemed to be back to their working order, I just think this is something they need to keep an eye on, also another problem was with the amount of children running riot in the hotel messing around with the elevators and running off after they had called for them, don’t get me wrong I was a child once and use to the find the funny side but when you are standing with crowds of people waiting to get to the higher levels stairs aren’t really a good option, I think the amount of children were there together on a school trip, all in all we enjoyed our stay and would use the Gallivant again.","Norwich, United Kingdom",3,3.0

We know because 2 grown men got thrown into a full-size bed for a night until another room opened up the following day. The cons,1. Rooms are small, not as small as a European or Japan style hotel room, but not much bigger.2. The walls are thin! You can hear everything.3. Only half a shower door exist, so water will splash everywhere. 4. The heater/AC is either noisy or does not work correctly. Our first room, once we turned on the heater, we could not get the off button to work. When it turned on, it literally would scare us. Our second room, we had to use the AC because the room was oddly hot! The heater was either running or something was warming our entire room through the day.5. Sheets are not changed, ask to get the sheets changed or you will find some hidden stains. 6. There is no bar, just 2 sit down restaurants that are connected.7. The fitness center is smaller than the rooms, with not much space for anything. 1 treadmill, 1 bench and weights, 1 elliptical, vending machine and a water fountain. No tvs by the way. 8. The TV are either old or not setup correctly because the images were cut off on top and button and no way to adjust.There are some pros1. The fitness and business center is 24 hours.2. Time Square is less than 5 minute walk.3. The train stations for all points are only a few blocks, including the ones connecting to JFK airport.4. The staffs are friendly enough.5.

We paid an unheard of price ($117) for being so close to Times Square. For those that are claiming a small bathroom, we have seen smaller and in much worse shape and the room size is not uncommon, but we do love the renovations they've made on the old ""TRYP"" hotel. There are much worse places to stay for twice the price. Although the elevators are small we didnt find the short wait or the size much of a problem. The lobby is small but modern and clean.

Very happy with hotel location, reception, check in etc, got a twin room as requested, high up, so it was quiet. Don’t be in a rush the lifts are slow. Upon arrival in the room, couple of things, space is limited, but if you have been to NY before you will know that. I always check under the bed and to my disgust found a 10 day old box of left over chicken wing remains from Hooters. Lovely. Secondly my bed sheets and pillow were covered in long black hair strands from the last lady who stayed in the bed. I had to question if they sheets were even changed? I slept on my jacket as a pillow for duration of my stay. Didn’t even bother asking reception as I don’t expect it would be dealt with.I’m not putting the hotel down as a whole, but cleaning needs to do some extra checks to prepare each bedroom. Overall my stay experience here was ok and not as bad as a lot of the comments make out. I just ask the management team to put a bit more focus on cleanliness and care to stop all these negative comments coming in. They reply to a lot of people saying they will look into it, but it’s obvious that doesn’t really happen. It’s a shame because this hotel has a lot to offer guests going to visit the Big Apple !!One last thing- if booking through any of the hotel discount sites, just be aware the online price does not include all the taxes and city taxes and tourist taxes and Times Square taxes that the hotel add on per night to your bill!!!

There is plenty of mixed reviews here on TA, but for the price we paid for 5 nights we really couldn’t turn it down. First of all I would just like to say what a great hotel it turned out to be. Check in was really quick and that’s what’s needed when you arrive at 1:30am. They do ask for a credit card on arrival to keep on file. Next the room... I see people saying the rooms are small but your in NYC you get what you pay for BUT our room was pretty spacious for a double. Large double bed very comfortable, only downside to the room was the bathroom and I agree with other people’s reviews they are small. The location of the hotel is perfect. Basically a minute walk and your on Times Square. (Amazing). Plenty of places around the hotel for food and drinks. Only problem we found is that there is a fire station just around the corner and there is plenty of sirens coming from them at all times of the night. But who needs sleep it is NYC after all. (Lol). But seriously it really is a great hotel. Rooms are great, staff extremely friendly and helpful, location is perfect.

We had only just checked in so it would have been nice to have been told then. The first morning we used the coffee provided. When we left to go out for the day, I left a note asking if we could have some more coffee and sugar.

Also in this room the shower was cold and wouldn’t go hot but an engineer came out to fix it. On the plus side the bed is very comfy and the pillows are a good size.

It was our first time so we of course wanted something Central, after that as long as the bed was comfy we knew we'd be happy. Well The Gallivant certainly didn't disappoint! 2 minutes walk from the middle of Times Square, rooms are cosy in terms of size, all en suite, extremely comfortable bed, modern decor which made what is a bit of a dated hotel feel very stylish and unique. We honestly didn't spend much time in the room except for sleeping and getting ready in the mornings, after that we usually didn't return til the night. For tourists it's the perfect option. There's no restaurant in the hotel but I believe the Chinese next door does breakfast at a reduced rate. However with so many various options within a 10 minute walk we decided against trying the Chinese so I can't vouch for it. Staff are polite and friendly. Concierge was lovely and set us up on the shuttle bus to JFK for our return journey, $55 though so not much cheaper than a taxi but certainly more comfortable and easier to manage with luggage. There's PC & printing facilities in the hotel free of charge which was much appreciated by us as we had tickets to a few shows and games that we couldn't print until the day before. Bed was made every day and towels renewed, just remember to leave the Do Not Disturb sign up until leaving or else you will likely have knocks on the door at 7am. Hotel lobby is gorgeous.

We went right up - elevator was waiting at the lobby level. We had a family room - 1414 to be exact and it was perfect. Was the elevator slow? Not really - it could take a while in high traffic times, but that's any hotel. It wasn't very big either - but again - it's NYC - that's pretty typical. Back to the room. There was a closet that was perfect for our clothes and to keep the shopping bags. A little alcove across from the door perfect for our suitcases. A huge bathroom. No, there wasn't a shower curtain - but common sense would tell you to point the shower head towards the far corner and the water doesn't go out into the bathroom. Add the shower mat across the entrance and we never had a problem with water on the floor. Great water temp and pressure even on the 14th floor!The beds were 2 single bunk beds and two double beds as advertised on the web site. huge? no, but they were exactly what was advertised. Very comfortable as were the linens and pillows. Everything was spotless and well kept. Housekeeping came in each day and did a great job! No complaints there. We never ate at the restaurant off the lobby - we went to the Times Square Diner just around the block - We are very picky about food and this is the best diner I've ever been to. It's a very busy place, but even with a wait out the door you don't have to wait long. Food comes quickly, is amazingly good and the service is amazing - such nice people! They are great talking to kids too! If we go back to NYC I will absolutely eat there! As for the hotel overall - the place was amazing - especially for the price and location. So close to everything - restaurants, shops, shows, subways! Best location ever!!!","Clemmons, NC",17,5.0

The decor of the hotel is also very nice, room, bathroom and bedroom. Yes the bedroom is small but it has a chair, small wardrobe and chest of draws so it has everything you except. The bathroom is very nice. On the small side. However the shower is a really good size. We spoke to a few quests who said they had issue with the water being to hot but ours was fine. The most common theme was the air con within all guests. At home I can generally sleep through noise but it sounded like there was someone in the room banging continuously all night on a metal pipe. We got to the point where we turned it off and unplugged It and it still continued. It worked and was very good just extremely noisy.For us that was the only real negative. We never had cleaners in our room, we thought it was strange for a hotel as we did see them around but they never came in monday- Friday was our stay. Wasn’t a problem but as I said unusual.

We paid over $3000 for 7 nights for a family room that included 2 double beds and 2 pull down bunk beds.The position was perfect for us as we planned on seeing a few Broadway Shows which were an easy walk from the hotel. We were on the 13th floor which had a view over 8 th Ave. The room was larger than expected with a small fridge. We used the 2 bunks for our suitcases which was perfect. The bathroom was large and modern, and all amenities were provided. The subway was only one block down and we used the hop on and hop off bus for a few of our tours. This bus stop was on 8th ave just around the corner and we were also in the heart of Times Square. Check in and check out was efficient, our room was made up each day with fresh towels.On the negative side we were situated above the NY Fire dept and had noise all the time, but for us it added to the NY adventure. We were a little crowded at times sharing one bathroom, however we hardly spent any time in the room other than to sleep.

Unfortunately, we didn't know what we were up against. I won't get into hotel details, feel free to read the other reviews; you'll notice if they really bother or not by the way they haven't actually replied to any replies yet.Robbed.Our stay was during the 'Bomb Cyclone' that hit earlier this year. We had a package that was due to be delivered on the 5th of January. Clearly, due to flight delays, we were unable to wait at the hotel to actually receive the package, so we informed the reception several times that they needed to decline the package. We also suggested that we would cover any additional costs in order to have it collected and shipped to the right address. Convinced by 'Aziz' the staff we were in contact during the whole process that he would ensure that he would 'decline the package and return to sender'; alas nothing has happened. So, 20 days later, and after several emails inquiring about the state of this package, they have confirmed finally that they have 'returned to sender'. Unfortunately USPS confirms that they have actually dropped the package at the reception. Stinks.Feel free to pop into this hotel if your idea of New York is to have a great stinking vacation. The rooms are depressingly old, smell funky and the attitude of the staff are to be blamed.Unprofessional.There's nothing that I could compare in all my travels that would redeem this hotel from any right doings.

We had literally taken every penny out of our cards for the trip prior to visiting therefore we did not have $125 to cover the 5 days we were staying and had to inform the receptionist of this. She was not happy and instantly told us we were to ensure of not to touch/break anything within the room; that was fine... until we got to the room - items were already broken!! Including the aircon! (I can imagine this to be hell in summer as the room was absolutely roasting even in winter at all hours of the day). Everything is tatted and needs an entire revamp, towels with stains on them, bed sheets stained, lights not working etc. On top of all this, the maids who visited the room daily have both been really short and rude, cutting me off when trying to explain certain situations (in which I shouldn’t even need to explain myself!!) not acceptable. The very last complaint I have with the hotel is that I cut my finger badly and required a plaster, called downstairs to reception to enquire about providing me with a plaster - pretty universal first aid item - and was told they didn’t have any??

Points of note.- our heating didn’t work on the 1st night and we had to call down to reception several times and had to physically go down twice to chase for a fix for it. (This actually warmed me up having to do this!) Eventually the heating was fixed but staff in front desk didn’t really apologise for it taking so long to be fixed (around 1 hour but after a long flight and travel from the UK we just wanted to sleep!) - as mentioned earlier the lifts were working during our stay but be prepared to wait for a while as they are small and have to serve 14+ floors. - we were on the back of the hotel and could hear a number of generators but look this is central New York and noise is a given!

When we asked about this the lady on reception said that's standard procedure for an authorization and that it will be credited back onto the account. I asked if I could have a written letter stating what they have told me , and the receptionist put me on the phone ( pretty unprofessional) to the manager . The manager stated again that is would go back onto the account ....again all I asked for for was a letter stating what he said. He then said he would get one for me.

It was my first time in NYC, went for 2 nights, 3 days with a friend for New Year’s Eve. The hotel location was unreal.. any other hotel nearby was going for about 4x the cost. You’re right in Times Square, 5 minute walk to 5th ave and Rockefeller, 10 to Central Park, subway and great food all around. Customer service, concierge all good experiences and fast. Given how crazy their weekend must have been, dealing with sold out guests and security /police for the Ball Drop id say the service was great. Hotel felt safe. For the price, I expected worse! It’s certainly not your 5x glam hotel, but you really get the New York experience and location for cheap. Things to be aware of if you are picky on your hotel. It’s an older building that they’ve done appearance touch ups (new wall paper, New lamented floors). It’s an older elevator but they have stairs if you’re skiddish. It’s radiator heat unit by the window. Small bathrooms and there were some sort of fruit fly like bugs that seemed to reappear in the shower every morning (never saw any bugs in the room, only tiny flies that stayed in the shower). The pipes are older and you can hear them throughout the night, however so too are sirens because you’re downtown NYC so really can’t complain about pipes!

I don't even know where to begin!! I checked in and was shocked at how SMALL the room was even for NYC. I came back to my room at 2am to take a shower and the shower was clogged and started to over flow also sheets were dirty and smelled, so we went to the front desk and the front desk agent accused us of clogging the shower and when we told him we hadn't showered yet he asked why we hadn't showered earlier which was irrelevant and none of his business anyways. He gave us a different room that had a furnace attached to the wall instead of a blowing unit and when we turned it on it made a loud water noise and smelled horrible and the layout of the room made no sense! The next room had no hot water and the heater blew out cold air. The final room he gave us (by this time it was about 4am) was a street view where we heard a flag whipping loudly and dump trucks taking garbage all night long! He was SO RUDE and the maintenance man and the cleaning crew were RUDE and said we were just being picky! The entire hotel was DISGUSTING and a mess! The vending machines took our money and we were not accommodated for ANYTHING THE ENTIRE STAY! When I asked to speak with a manager I was told he was not available to speak with me so we would just have to deal with it. This hotel was located near time square and across from a parking garage that was the ONLY good thing about it!

We arrived at 1:30 understanding that our room would most likely not be available so we took the opportunity to stretch our legs and grab lunch after a long drive. I requested a room on the highest floor possible, and the manager was able to accommodate putting us in a family suite on the 10th floor. We were checked in and in the room by 3:15. The room was spacious and clean, and surprisingly quiet. The only noises I heard were a few sirens around 1am, but I'm a fairly light sleeper and no one else had an issue. The beds were a bit smaller than I expected, but they were comfortable and clean. The bunk beds worked well for 13 and 19 year old girls. The only thing I did not like was the bathroom in our suite. I do not know if it is designed for handicap guests, but there is no separation of the shower and the remainder of the bathroom. The drains prevented any flooding or serious inconvenience, but it was not at all enjoyable for any of us. The shower head and water pressure/temperature were all acceptable. I'm OK with the no shower door/curtain concept in hotels, but this did not have any enclosure to ensure the bathroom would not be completely soaked and could prove to be dangerous. I've attached pictures. The TV was old and outdated and was at an angle where not everyone could get a good view of the screen. This did not matter to us as we did not watch the TV but if you plan on watching TV at all in this room set up, you will be disappointed.The doorman/valet, and everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and pleasant. It is not by any means a luxury hotel but a solid 3 stars and relatively budget friendly depending on when you make your reservations. My only complaints are the bathroom set up and the teeny tiny slow elevators.As far as location- it couldn't get much better.

Definitely not a luxury hotel despite what you see on their site’s photos. So the main facts that disappointed us were:1) the bed was comfortable but small-definitely not a king/queen size, it barely fitted me and my husband.2) the room seemed to lack maintenance on the air conditioning units (broken)3) we could not regulate the room temperature and during the first nights of our stay when it was hot in the city (15 degrees Celsius) we had difficulty sleeping because it was too hot.4) the hotel has three elevators from which one is for the hotel employees and another one most of the times didn’t work. And with 15 floors and I don’t know how many rooms you can imagine what happened at the lobby during rush hours.

I didn't mind that it was so small, but it was so dusty I had to clean everything ( even the bathroom sink) myself and when I picked up the phone to call the front desk ( there was no blanket on my bed) There were dead bugs all over it. There were also ants everywhere. The bathroom, all over the dresser and on the night tables. I called the front desk but nothing was done about it. She just said ""I'll let housekeeping know"". When I went to bed after doing some sightseeing, I noticed a horrible smell on the sheets, but I was so tired I didnt bother calling the front desk again and just took them off. The bed was very uncomfortable and the mattress was sunk in the middle. I also had to ask a housekeeper for some washcloths as there were none in my room and she was very nice and gave me a couple. The balcony was probably the best part of my room. Too bad it was too cold to spend any time out there. It was my first trip to New York and I had a great time and met a lot of really nice people while I was there, so I will visit again, but will definitely not stay at there again. Don't let the pictures fool you. The nicest part of the hotel is the lobby. They also say on their website that bottled water is provided in each room ( it wasn't ) Not such a big deal, but I also had to practically beg for a tea bag.

After reading the reviews I was apprehensive but I wanted a boutique type hotel that was close to Times Square as I didn’t want a cookie cutter hotel like the Marriott. When we arrived we were greeted by Tricia, we arrived at 9:30am and told us we could check in right away and gave us a couple of rooms to choose from. The rooms are not large but they were fine. She then upgraded us to a premium room which was very big with a double bed and bunk beds and a wall between us. The hotel is so close to everything we never needed to take a taxi or Lyft. The housekeeping staff were very sweet and accommodating and kept our room clean daily. The hotel staff were very nice. There is a wonderful Chinese restaurant adjoined to the hotel and if you want to see Bruce Springsteen in Broadway then he’s across the street. The elevators are small but again this is a boutique hotel so if your looking for something affordable, close to EVERYTHING and more personable then The Gallivant is perfect and our trip to NY was amazing.

The bed was comfy (although I’m slightly OCD so I bring my own sheets ad towels) but it looked neat and freshly made. My only complaints were that there was no microwave or fridge available on the entire premises. I asked. But if I see a review that states they are available upon request, then I would be very disappointed in them. I wasted a lot of leftover food because of that. Aside from that, I had another issue. I was supposed to receive a gift item upon check in but it took me 2 days and 3 staff members to finally get it. I booked my room 2 months in advance but next time I’ll shop around.

We arrived to a warm and friendly welcome from the lady with the fabulous hair. Reception was very clean and modern looking and the lady in front desk couldn’t of been anymore helpful.

The room is a corner room with 4 windows. As you walk in there are. Ink beds that pull out from the wall and a dressing table and TV. There is a wall divide and the other side of the wall is a huge queen size bed with bedside tables, chest of draws, Another TV and a chair. The view isn’t much, just the brick walls of the surrounding buildings but it was warm, clean and inviting. The bathroom had a huge shower with endless boiling hot water too. There is a wardrobe and two full length mirrors, coffee maker, safe and hairdryer. The Hotel has a Chinese next door that you can get to via a door by the end of the front desk. My hubby and children went the breakfast on our last morning and were both very happy and very full. It is a Buffett style and offers all the English breakfast options, plus tea, coffee, juices and pastry’s too. The reason for dropping a star is that although I was leaving a tip of $5 per day, only the beds were made, the towels changed and the bin emptied. The floor wasn’t swept for the whole of our visit. There is a very helpful lady who sits to the left of the Hotel doors. She knows everything about getting around NYC and will even draw your route into a map. I didn’t catch her babe but she was so helpful. We brought way too much at jersey gardens and asked if we could get a bigger taxi to fit the four of us in with all our bags. She arranged a fabulous suburban to take us to a JFK for only $99.

I was worried when I saw a lot of bad reviews, so we went in with low expectations. I'm not picky and usually never write reviews, but this place was unacceptable and almost ruined our weekend. We got to our room, which was small as expected.. Room 223 on the second floor. We quickly noticed a mound in the ceiling where the plaster was falling in, probably from a leak, and was just painted over. I found another reviewer mention that this room had a leak from this spot. There was also peeling and bubbling paint all around the wall, radiator, and window.. must have been from moisture coming through the wall and window. Right when we got in we heard a loud banging noise, like a hammer on metal.. I thought that someone was either working outside the window, or the room next door was being worked on. The room was also extremely hot.. I tried thermostat and it didn't work, so we just figured we would open the windows when needed. We went out for the night and came back. While getting ready for bed around 11 we heard the banging noise again. Seemed to be in the wall right behind our bed. It would progressively get louder for about 5 minutes, stop for about 10 minutes, and then start up again. We tried to sleep but couldn't with how loud it was. We were also right behind the hotel's street sign, so spotlights where shining right onto our room and through the blinds. Since it was so hot we would crack the windows, but then the street noise and sirens were too loud since we were just a floor off the street. I called the lobby and they said they were sold out for the evening so we couldn't switch rooms, but would switch us the next day. They didn't seem surprised. Needless to say it was a miserable night. The next day they apologized and said that it is a boiler heater, so it makes that banging noise when heating up. They then moved us to a room on the 11th floor, which had it's own heater/cooler with a knob to adjust. Luckily this room was bearable, and they did give us $100 off for what happened, even though I wanted the whole night refunded. Unfortunately our whole first day in the city was pretty miserable since we hadn't slept the whole night. I saw a reviewer on yelp the next day (Maricela) write a review for the same room, so it is obvious that they are just cycling people through these rooms without addressing issues. A lot of the bad reviews seem to be with the heating/cooling (noise or lack of heat/air or thermostat) and maintenance in the rooms. If this place upgrades it hvac and repairs minor things around the rooms it would be a good hotel. The location was the only thing going for it.

This may be a common feature in New York but it came as a shock to us. The ensuite shower room was so small that one had to straddle the toilet in order to close the door behind you. What really impacted on our holiday was that our part of the hotel did not have any central heating for a couple days. I understand that stuff can break down and it probably wasn't anyone's fault but the staff's lack of communication or empathy on this matter was extraordinary. No apology. No attempt at booking us somewhere else. No offer of assistance. The bed was pushed right up against the aircon/radiator and without heat it was simply an open vent to allow gale force artic winds to blow through. It was cold enough to see our breath in the room. We asked for a portable electric heater but they had none left. They eventually sent up a couple extra duvet blankets which were very thin but did just enough to prevent hypothermia.

It was very difficult to get ready to go each morning because it has no place to set things. There is also no shower curtain or door in the shower, so the bathroom floods each time you bathe. We called and asked about that and were told that was the design. The shower also drained slowly, so you stood in a 2 inch puddle the whole time. The water was also either burning hot or ice cold.

The only downside was very small hanging space available and only 1 chest of draws. There was a hair dryer and the bathroom was a wet room with plenty of towels provided and shower gel, shampoo and conditioner should you have forgotten your own. The lifts were always busy so on more than one occasion some of us decided to walk down the stairs. For some reason never seemed to have a problem getting a lift to go up to the room. A couple of times had to have the keys re-coded.

Easy to get to from JFK with a great location and facilities. After reading a lot of negative reviews I had very low expectations and was a bit nervous when turning up from the UK. Check in was easy and our room on the 6th floor (room 618) was just what we needed. We got the king room and it was very spacious, after reading that most rooms were tiny I was pleasantly surprised. Our room looked out onto the street and those negative reviews sparked some anxiety thinking that we wouldn't get any sleep with it being so noisy, boy was I wrong. Probably one of the comfiest beds I've slept in in a hotel and the size of the king bed made for a good night's sleep next to my girlfriend who sleeping next to normally resembles what I can only describe as a 6 hour WWE wrestling match. It was noisy with traffic and theaters finishing shows up until about 11 o'clock but then after that everything seemed to stop and I didn't wake up once during the night from any noise.The room was clean and got cleaned every day by housekeeping, they even folded my jeans I'd left on the floor and put them on the bed. Bathroom was ok and again nice and clean. Getting down to the reception was slow at times as with only 2 lifts they can be busy in the morning but with only being on the 6th floor we often opted for the stairs which wasn't to much of a stretch.Free high speed WiFi was a great inclusion and allowed me to catch up with things back home. All major subways being less than 5 min walk was great as we got it pretty much everywhere and downtown to world trade center was the furthest away at a 20ish min ride.There is only one negative to the stay, which unfortunately was/is quiet a big one. Upon check in a credit card is stored for a security deposit and for the $60 city tax fee. We were told on check in that nothing is taken and it is only recorded until check out. 5 days later at check out we were told about the $60 fee (plus small change in tax) and made our way to the airport for our flight home. Once there my GF went to check our online banking to find that the hotel had taken £71 in charges - which equates to roughly $100. The transaction took place on our first day, shortly after check in. After an email for an explanation we received a receipt showing charges for $60, when we sent back a screen shot of the £71 taken they said they would sort it out and give us a refund for the overcharge. This is currently being sorted and I hope we get that money back, if not we have already contacted our CC company who were more than helpful in freezing and flagging the transaction.Booked through Expedia at under £500 the hotel offered everything we needed, a great location and a clean comfy bed. Marred only by this transaction issue which could have gone unnoticed if not for my GF we had a great trip to NYC. Would give it a 4-5 star review if not for this $100 charge that someone has made. With that currently being resolved I'll go middle of the road and give it a 3 ","Staffordshire, United Kingdom",15,3.0

The heat pump AC/heating did not seem to work but we were not bothered at the time we we were there.There were a few small faults (lights and the bathroom fan not working) but left them to see if housekeeping would pick them up as pretty obvious and get maintenance to fix them 'proactively'. Unfortunately they did not - suggest training housekeeping staff to look for obvious faults and report them.

Abundant restaurants and sandwich shops nearby with most of the city's subway lines less than a 5 minute walk away and minutes to Times Square However, situated on a one way west to east bound traffic street in the theater district, traffic gets to be really heavy making blaring car horns common.

I had made the booking through a popular third party website having reviewed its facilities and the surrounding area - It was exactly what we were looking for, for the right price. Upon arrival, the hotel lobby and check in process was as expected. I had booked a twin double room with no board. My friend and I received our room key and went up to the 2nd floor where we were booked to stayed. Having stepped out of the elevator i then realised our room was right opposite - Initially this worried me as i feared it would be noisy. We went into the room; it was dark and bit rough around the edges (corners of furniture scuffed and chipped). The room was not of any that were pictured on the website i had used to book the stay. Unfortunately being on the 2nd floor and New York city being built up, we got very little daylight, making the room dingy. Still, the bed was very comfy and the bathroom was clean and had all we needed. Upon checking around the room further, we did find that there was also plenty of dirt and dust around the edges, behind the bedside table, on the room telephone etc. We aren't ones to complain but the straw that broke the camels back was when we retired to bed early the first night due to jet lag, and found ourselves repeatedly disturbed by passers by outside the room using the elevator. Ordinarily, i would have put this down to bad luck having our roomed picked out for us by whoever organised the booking, however we could hear multiple conversations as if our bedroom door was wide open and the persons were standing right next to us. The sound proofing seemed non existent. All the above led to my friend going down to the hotel front desk early morning to request a room change as we couldn't possibly manage 4 further nights of interrupted sleep. The member of staff we spoke to couldn't have seemed to care less and said we should return at 10 am and maybe if someone is checking out we could talk about a room swap. We did return and explained the situation to another front desk member of staff who informed us that the only twin double rooms available were in the same position of the building up all 16 floors, however if we were willing to share a bed that she could sort a room change out for us. Now this is not what we booked for, but balancing bunking up with your best mate against hearing the gallivant's 2nd floor gossip for the next fews days, we opted to bunk up. The member of staff asked us to drop our bags off downstairs, and that by 3pm we'd have a new room. We were somewhat doubtful but did as she said and went out for the day.Having returned, we did indeed get issued a new room. The front desk lady had very kindly upgraded us. We were now on the 15th floor, in a family room which had light, was clean, and as pictured on the third party website id used for booking. We had much more space being a larger room and i have to say, the room change really enhanced our overall trip. Had we stayed in the dingy, dark, dirty room for 5 days we'd have had a sour taste left in our mouths. Despite the initial staff we came into contact with who clearly didn't give a hoot about the state of the crappy room we originally had and how poor our first night had been, this lady turned it all around. She was apologetic, helpful and sympathetic. Overall, i would stay at this hotel again; the location was perfect for everything we wanted to do (surrounded by theatres, bars, shops, times square, and subway links), however i would not ever book a twin double room here, and would consider upgrading to the family room despite not needing to sleep 4 as the extra space was great!",,4,3.0

Our room was fairly small and the cleaners were hit and miss, some days our beds were made, others they weren't. The air conditioning in the room was extremely loud and clunky causing a few interruptions in the night.Only one lift worked which meant excessive queues for lifts and when they finally arrived they were full with no space, we resorted to using the stairs most of the time which wasn't great being on a high floor. The hotel itself could do with a lick of paint and investing in some window cleaners.Having said that, staff were friendly, not overly helpful, but friendly.

The room was painted grey and had water leak stains on the ceiling. It was very dull and lacked light so we spent as much time as possible out of our room. I was travelling with a young relative who told me the darkness made her feel depressed. Plenty of towels and the room was clean with coffee facilities. The shower was nice and hot and some toiletries were supplied. The safe was so high up on a shelf that it was impossible to use so we had two carry our valuables with us during our stay.

(It was even difficult to take photos of the room because it's small). The bed could take only one person, very tight to move around the room, the toilet is like a flight toilet - very small, also the door should be changed or heavily fixed because it does not close and broken, it make high noises when opened or closed.Not a lot of amenities. Not bad bed and pillow quality. Towels are good and clean.Cleaning level is good.I highly recommend you not to use the services of the concierge, 1st of all he is the rudest that I have ever met during my travels, 2nd lacks a lot of accurate information - especially regarding prices, he gives you a price then he calls to book then it's higher, last but not least the prices he gives are 15 - 30% higher than the prices outside!The hotel location is great, in Times Square which makes it a walking distance from the shows and the active touristic action of Manhattan. An advise if you like the location and rate for this hotel to make sure not to book a standard room, any higher category, especially if it is double occupancy, so you could have a comfortable stay.All in all the hotel would take a 6.5 of 10 in my opinion.

First thing was the room door, it was loose and looked as if it had been kicked in, when the door was closed you could see out of the room between the door and the frame and hear everything.The view was of a pigeon crap covered air con and heating plant facing a brick wall and other apartments.Bed time, we settled down for the night. About 3am we were woken by a clattering and juddering which sounded like a spanner had been thrown into an engine. The air con unit in the room had seized and was looking like it was ready to explode (see the pictures). Turned it off at the wall, kept awake by the air con plant outside the window.Next morning youngest son was in the shower, the shower faucet fell off and hit my son on the foot making him cry and bruising his foot.I went to reception and complained I was offered a change of room but as we were unpacked and there for one more night I declined, we agreed the room would be repaired once we went out for day. I made it very clear we would be out all day and would be leaving at 1030am.On return to the hotel late afternoon the room had not been made up and none of the issues fixed, I complained only to be told because the do not disturb sign was on the door they did not enter. I pointed out I had told the staff we were out all day, I was made to feel this was my fault.Returned to the room toilet was now not flushing and a whole bank of lights in the room went out and would not work.After another sleepless night I went down to reception and complained I was taken aside by a manager Ben Elie and after recanting the whole sorry saga he stated my bill would be taken care of.On return to the UK my bill was ""discounted"" by a lousy $75 a night, not my understanding of being taken care of clearly. I guess as Im no longer in the country we are not important.Bottom line people do not stay here it is a dump, the hallways are dark and seedy, ice machines work intermittently and the lifts take forever to arrive.Lesson learned I guess but at least I can offer my experience as a warning to others.One last attempt to get this resolved by writing to Interstate Hotels CEO Michael J.

It's basically a place to get changed and sleep... there's so much to do in the City that we were hardly ever in there.The location itself is less than a 5 minute walk to Times Square, and is also situated right in the heart of Broadway with one of the Theatres right across the road - it was the Bruce Springsteen show that was about to start it's run and one day we seen the Boss himself going in for rehearsals.Instead of going down Broadway you're only a 10 minute walk to all the shopping on 5th and 6th Ave and again only a few minutes walk to a subway station that will get you on one of the many lines running through the city. A $32 weekly ticket was worth it weight in gold and saved us an absolute fortune as we were all over the city every day.If I was going back to NYC again I would definitely think about staying here again as we had a great time.Thanks to all the staff who made our stay so friendly, welcoming, and worth while!","Hamilton, United Kingdom",46,4.0

Our double room was a reasonable size but the bathroom was tiny with it not being more than a metre wide. It was case that you did not have much room to sit on the toilet!!The wardrobe was tiny with very few hangers and the bedside lights could not be switched on or off if you were laying in bed. They had obviously been replaced as the original switches were still there but whoever installed them certainly did not think about those staying in the room.Also the windows were not double glazed and so the traffic noise could be heard.

A friend was able to get a better rate than TripAdvisor (however they have great rates, as a user/writer since 2010), and I just have to say that 65 million strange visitors from another planet to NYC have been challenging for a local.The hotel has had at least 3 owners in my tenure, and I remember when my mom stay at the Best Western then. It was dumpy and small. Gallivant has really turned around my impression! The lobby is bustling, bright, with a lot of drapes to cover up the old look and make it new. The staff is friendly by NYC standards, and our room is bigger than our 600 sq. ft. apt was right across the street on 48th! We have a family room, with 2 Murphy beds, two doubles, and a bathroom that I have never seen so large in all my worldwide travels! Device users: Gallivant has so many wall outlets for devices and an international charging station on the desk. No alarm clock, but who needs that anymore? Gallivant has a mandatory $15 “Urban fee” to all guests. For the fast Wi-Fi and wall outlets, I’ll pay that.Wi-fi was very fast and easy to set up my 2 laptops, 1 iPad, and two phones. NOTE: AT&T has never resolved the poor signal in Times Square. 1 bar if you are lucky to get any bars at all. Some negatives:The elevators are small, and international traveler’s and tours use this hotel frequently. It will take you more time to check-in and check-out, so be forewarned. There were lines of tourist luggage filling the lobby. Trash bins in the hallway make it difficult to maneuver luggage to the elevators.This is an international hotel, so be prepared for delays. I stood alone with three agents at the check-in desk, and was ignored by all three for well over 4 minutes as they bantered back and forth multi-tasking, including chatting w/ an employee showing pix on a phone. Check-in is at 3pm, and there is a fee for holding your bag, which is typical. Please, please, please, tip your bag service person. He is your friend. One dollar per bag, and if it is heavy, even more. New Yorker’s tip for good service. Sometime you just have to throw money at good service.Huge tip: take ANY elevator that opens, even if you are going down. Go up and enjoy the ride down, especially if you have a large suitcase! My shameless endorsement restaurant tips for the mid-town area:An’Nam (Vietnamese/Chinese) 1 door from Gallivant. (Ask for Peggy or James)Pongsri (Thai)La Masseria (Italian)Virgil’s (BBQ)Hurley’s (Irish Pub)Natsumi (Sushi)Carmines (Italian, and good for large groups)My all-time favorite pizza is John’s Pizza of Times Square. They deliver to the Gallivant, and if you visit in person, it is located in a circa 1929 church.The Gallivant has been a positive experience for me, a die-hard New Yorker of 24 years, with very little patience. Once you are past the noise/horns/sirens and the NYFD fire station below The Gallivant, that lost 12 firefighter’s on 11-9-2001, there is a nice park dedicated to those who saved lives just across the street on 48th Street with a lovely memorial fountain.-David Allen","Cairo, New York",137,3.0

The room rates were quite expensive compared to the room quality and the service we suffered.Next time we will choose another hotel and book over normal platforms which offer protection in case we are not satisfied.Alternatively we will choose Airbnb.We booked over the app “hotel tonight”, which was close to fraud, because if you want to change the hotel due to planned cancellation they do not refund you any money! You are forced to stay in the hotel you have booked even if you are not satisfied.Additionally to say is,that the pictures in the above mentioned app were COMPLETELY different from the room we got. So the Gallivant finally ripped us off and gave us the smallest room they have. Asking for a room change was really tough because our complaints were ignored - only an upgrade was “offered”, but honestly we did not want to pay any cent more and decided to treat the room only as a place to sleep. That’s how we arranged us the 4 nights.The room was simply too small. Maximum 2x3 square meters. The TV was old and the picture was kind of cutted (you could not see the full picture, no settings possible). The bed was ok,but for American proportions just okay for two persons. The room was clean. But some dust on places like tv, aircon etc.The cleaning staff smashed the door in the morning as if there is no tomorrow:) the doors are a little bit strange, like metal doors on a ship. Our view was uninteresting - we looked in the inner courtyard which was really dirty and dark. But there rolling shutters you can arrange with:)The only “good” thing about the Gallivant was: rooms were quite clean. But I think this should be natural in a hotel. The location close to the Times Square is really practicable.My recommendation if you still want to book it:Do not book over the hoteltonight-App and ensure that eventual complaints allow you to get your money back in case the Gallivant employees try to make a fool of you.Even better: ask which room type you will receive and ensure to see it beforehand.I saw other rooms during the cleaning staff opened some doors during cleaning.

The staff are friendly especially the housekeeping crew. You get free baggage storage if you have a reserved room - which came in handy for us since we arrived early morning. The location is great, with just two blocks to times square, about 15 minutes walk to Central Park, and just in general walkable to most other places in Midtown. The 8th Ave, Broadway, and 7th Ave subway lines are also within 2-3 blocks if you're going anywhere slightly farther.The good things pretty much stop there though. The rooms are tiny, small enough that a ""standard room"" actually comes with a full-sized bed instead of queen, so if there are two of you sharing that bed, be prepared to cuddle. The AC is extremely loud, and it doesn't help that it's right by the bed - so we pretty much had to leave it on all day to keep the room cool just so we can have it off when we sleep. The elevators are also tiny (I'm talking full with 5 people with no luggage), and the fact that large tour groups from Europe tend to live here doesn't help with that.

The room was clean and modern though Small, as to be expected in New York City. one complaint is the teeny tiny bathroom! It was recently remodelled and is nice, but your knees touch the wall when on the toilet! There is no where to put anything. It didn't matter to us on such a short stay, but if one had to drag their toiletries, make up, hair products etc... back and forth from the bathroom to the suitcase or desk everytime it could get annoying. Closet is also too small to fit a midsize suitcase. Bed linens were nice and clean and beds and pillows comfortable. We couldn't have asked for a better location! Literally one block from Times Square. The Rockafeller Center, radio city music hall, Carlos bakery, ripleys, Madame Tussaud's, Ellen's Stardust diner, Central Park, etc... all within 5-10 minutes walk. Lots of restaurants, comedy clubs, shopping, street vendors and food carts in the area. Three small things that could have improved our stay: 1- the mirror on the inside of the closet door should be moved to the outside, it's so dark behind the door and also too crammed to make use of it. It would have been handy to use while my partner was in the bathroom. 2- half wall glass shower with no door needs a curtain!!!! The floor and toilet got absolutely saturated even with the bath mat down! It's going to ruin the nice floors....3- they charged 2.00 a bag to store our luggage after checkout.

It was recommended by my travel agent, however I contacted them mid-stay to see if I could change hotels. As it was a prepaid stay I couldn't. I checked in on the first night into room number 1. It seemed kind of okay. However, after using the bathroom, the toilet wouldn't stop running. I called the front desk to let them know and they offered to give me another room (this was at about 1am).I then moved to the next room. It was tiny, cramped and stuffy, you had to step to the side of the toilet to even close the door. On top of this, the air conditioning barely worked, and was extremely noisy. I decided to deal with it and try and sleep. I'm not that tall, but I barely even fit in the bed. I didn't get much sleep that night. The next day I asked the front desk for someone to take a look at the air conditioning. The engineers came up to have a look, they took the filter out and it was absolutely disgusting and clogged. They cleaned it out and then taped up some gaps where air was escaping, however this still didn't fix the problem. I was offered another room transfer, and upon gathering my things I noticed trash under the bed. I was told to expect a phone call when the new room would be ready, but after waiting a while I went to call the front desk and found the phone didn't work. On arriving in my third room I found relief. The room was much bigger than the second room, the bed seemed larger, and the air conditioning worked. The only real problem with this room was that it wasn't 100% clean, and wasn't maintained too well, with the bathroom fan hanging out of the ceiling.Overall, this place is poorly run, dirty, and not well maintained at all. The value for money is poor, especially when you compare it to nearby hotels. You could say the location is great, but there are cheaper or near-price hotels close by.There shouldn't have been this many problems, and it clearly shows a much larger problem with the hotel management.

The hotel is right in the middle of Times Square. In between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. It has a restaurant and offers breakfast for $20. I didn't use the restaurant as there are so many places near by to eat. One very nice place is Ellen's Stardust Diner which is on east 51st street and Broadway. Good food lots of choice, reasonable prices and very clean. It has an A rating. Good atmosphere as the staff are all aspiring Broadway stars who sing in between serving. Back to the hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The hotels decor looks tired and would benefit from being painted. My room 1127 was a reasonable size, it was clean and there was a mattress cover on the bed. It had an iron, ironing board,hairdryer and coffee machine. Room was cleaned everyday. Bathroom was ok the only problem was there was no shelf to put toiletries on. there was a cupboard under the sink where you could put stuff. Room very noisy when the Windows were open, this issue is due to the location of the hotel and the fire station at the end of the block. I recommend you take ear plugs if you are bothered by noise. Overall this hotel is ideally situated to lots of places. Times Square,Broadway, the pick up.point for the bus tours, the subway and only 14 blocks to Macys. Although it was a bit expensive £1,800.00 for 7 nights you are paying for the location. I would recommend the Gallivant as a good place to stay.",,5,4.0

It's only a couple blocks from Times Square which was convenient for us.We had originally booked a basic queen room through travel zoo but were pleasantly surprised when we were given a king room when we arrived. The room was small but very modern and clean which was enough for us. Initially we had some issues with our shower as the water wasn't draining fast enough and took very long to get warm enough to shower but we were willing to overlook this. However our toilet then gave us problems as it wasnt flushing and was backing up every flush. We called the front desk and they were very quick about sending someone up to fix the toilet. A maintenance guy came with a plunger and said he fixed the problem. The next day it still wasnt flushing so we went down to the front desk and spoke with Antonio. Antonio worked immediately to fix our problem all while being very friendly and funny. All we asked for was a fixed toilet or to be moved to a new room if it could not be fixed. Antonio immediately said he would get us a new room! Not only did we get a new room but we were upgraded to the premium room. This room had 2 bunk beds, a much bigger bathroom and shower, and a whole separate bedroom with a large king bed and a view of the street! Our previous room had a view of a brick wall so we were very happy about this upgrade! We had to go down and thank Antonio a million times for his exceptional customer service.He had even let us immediately go back to our old room when we realized we forgot an ipad in the safe. The rest of our stay was amazing. Our room always smelt like fresh laundry and the maids did an exceptional job at leaving us enough towels,soaps,shampoo, etc. We were always very satisfied.

First of all... about us. We are in our mid-forties and travel a few times a year. We enjoy the finer things, but also aren't precious about everything. Think of it as champagne and hot dogs. And most importantly, we're really breezy and don't understand walking into anything immediately looking for things to complain about. We've been to New York several times and like to stay in midtown. This time we decided to try a new hotel. (Booked through Expedia.)I read some of the reviews and was a little nervous, but had no reason to be. Check-in was smooth. Really smooth. We were given exactly the type of room requested and Antonio on the front desk was charming and funny. The room was exactly as we imagined, and while the view was nothing spectacular, we weren't there to gaze out the window. The bed was comfortable and the amenities were fine. (Working room-safe, coffee maker, more than enough towels.) The air conditioner was a little intense and it took us a while to get it to a setting that worked for us.As for the general size complaints that seem to be mentioned a lot... Yes, the elevator was small, and the bathroom was comically small. (Really, if you were feeling feverish, you could sit on the toilet and rest your head on the tile wall opposite you.) But the water pressure was fantastic and the room was always clean. I also understand the complaints about storage if you are traveling for more than a few days, but our two small suitcases fit well inside the closet. For us, nothing beats the location. We walked almost everywhere, but also had access to most of the major subway lines within a few short blocks. We were steps away from Times Square, and also from some great little local brew-pubs and restaurants. There was a great grocery store around the corner for when we just felt like grabbing some pastries and drinks and heading back to the room after seeing a show or just at the end of a long day, and great breakfast spots nearby.

The hotel itself is well-situated, right by the shops, theatres and restaurants of Times Square. Excellent location. Our room and adjoining bathroom were both a nice size, well-furnished and for the most part we enjoyed our stay there. We had a few issues with the walk-in shower spurting water all over the floor. Could do with a bath mat. Other than that the room had pretty much everything you would expect: comfortable bed, safe, hairdryer, air con, TV, tea/coffee machine (though on the two occasions we requested tea bags wires were crossed and we were bizarrely sent more coffee). A fridge would have been useful but for five nights you can do without. If you have lots of luggage be aware that the lifts are very small: not many people can fit in them so it can be a long wait. On one occasion we gave up and walked up several flights of stairs instead. Our very first and last impressions of the hotel- which are ultimately the ones that stay with you- weren’t great. After we checked in we found that an additional fifteen dollars had been taken out of one of our party’s bank account for wifi. We pointed out to management that when we booked it had said that wifi was free. Whilst they did then remove the fee, we couldn’t help but feel irritated that it had happened in the first place. Classic case of a hotel advertising its facilities as free and then charging upon arrival. We later checked out of the hotel at the end of our stay only to find that both our flight- and the alternative transport we subsequently arranged to another state- had both been cancelled. As it was now 3am in a large city we didn’t know that well and given our relatively young age (22) we felt we had no option but to return to the hotel. We were quite disappointed when we explained the circumstances that the staff didn’t show more empathy. It was as though they could sense our desperation and the price reflected this. Obviously a hotel is a business and not a charity but we felt that given we had stayed there a while and had checked out literally that morning that the staff could have been more helpful and offered us a slightly better price than we were quoted. In summary, a nice hotel in a very good location. Wouldn’t stay again due to disappointing treatment by staff at end of holiday.

I was extremely confused, since the reservation I had in my hands said a double queen. He went on to explain that a double queen means you are either getting 1 double bed or 1 queen bed. Interesting play on words there. I explained to him that is going to make my stay extremely uncomfortable, but he said there is nothing he can do since the hotel is sold out. Asked me to come back down the next day and they might be able to switch my room. After receiving my key and going up to the room, I walk in and definitely got the 1 double bed. The bathroom was so small I couldn't shut the door while sitting down, I was too tall and it would clip my knees. The next day walked down to see if they could do anything about getting me into another room with another bed. A different gent said they have a twin full available. Not learning my lesson the first time, I agreed to switch rooms. Well the room was even smaller then the first with 1 twin bed. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Went back down and asked for my original room back and they were happy to accommodate my request. When booking, really make sure you read what you are booking.

We were a little dubious because of the reviews and the fact that the hotel changed hands between us booking the stay and staying there. But it was the most perfect city hotel I have stayed in, great location (right in Times Square) for the New York tourist. Don’t listen to the bad reviews I am well travelled and have been to dozens of cities over the years, if want you want is a warm comfortable place to rest after a long day of sight seeing then this is the place for you. The rooms were clean, modern and of a good size. The only issue we had was that one night the shower ran cold for about 10 minutes before it heated up, but it was in the dead of winter in a busy hotel. Also, we left the TV remote on the bed before going out in the day and the maid kept getting it caught in the bed sheets so we would have no remote when we went back, after the third time of this happening we found it hilarious. I am heading to New York with my father next January and have booked to stay here again. I plan to come back in the following July to experience summer in New York so look forward to trying out the roof top bar. Oh and another thing, the WIFI is top notch.

I loved the wallpaper with all the major NYC attractions listed. The lights were bright, making the room look tidy and cheery. The bathroom was a little small, but it sported a Grohe showerhead. Everything worked well. We were on the 3rd floor, but the sound from the streets did not get to us. The hotel is within walking distance to everywhere in the centre of NYC - Times Square, 5th Avenue, TheatreLand. We even walked to the Grand Central Terminal (a leisurely 20 minute stroll to check out the statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and to have breakfast there). Upon checkout, we defied the traffic jams, and walked, lugging our luggage all the way to 34 St NY Penn Station to catch our Amtrak train.We had pre-empted nasty bill surprises by emailing the hotel in advance to check on the final total bill to pay, inclusive of all taxes, fees and additionals. Hence, there were no hiccups there. The only grouse is that the lifts are exceedingly small, so do make time waiting for them.

We were going to stay cheap in a hostel though decided on the gallivant as the location was great and wanted to be comfortable. Upon arrival we had been on a plane for 19 hours and wished for a hot shower. We informed the front desk that the showers were just warm and that the sink was flooding. They seemed quite uninterested and said someone would check later. This was not looked at until the following day with the shower being fixed and the sink not. Following this the toilet lever continued to fall off and the air conditioning/heating vent leaked water onto the floor. Upon checkout 3 days later i queried the final price on my bill. I believed that an extra $300 (the price that i paid for my deposit) had been taken off my credit card. The receptionist made me feel quite distressed saying that it had nothing to do with them and should call my bank. This would be an international call and midnight back home. As a student on a big holiday we have saved for some time and that 300 is distressing. The receptionist finally paid attention as the line grew and i appologized to those waiting (something you would expect them to do.

I've stayed in many hotels in many countries, and these are the pluses I look for that were included at the Gallivant. Security- Doormen and cameras, as well as in room safes. Most important.Helpful staff - when your in a different country and need directions and advice, helpful desk staff and concierge are gold.Hygiene - the room was clean and refreshed daily. Soaps and condiments were available in the corridor to be used by guests as they wished. Toilet and shower cleaned with the room refresh. Thank you.Small room, who cares?

After standing our ground the hotel agreed to give us separate rooms.The rooms are small but when in NYC, you only need a roof over your head.... the beds were extremely comfortable and perfect for a good night's sleep after the business of new york.

We explained that we arrived yesterday and were staying for one week and definitely not checking out. She advised us to see the Manager which we did - he was apologetic and said let reception know as soon as we left for our evening out and the room would be serviced, which it was.

They literally answer you monosyllabically & certainly don't offer a smile.Rooms are teeny tiny.

But drainage was ok however I wouldn't imagine a long shower would be advisable or you might end up with a flooded floor. Rooms are modern, relatively clean but could do with more attention from the cleaning staff.Also the lighting in our room was very poor. We had two windows facing a wall & basically it felt like it was permanently night time in our room.Bed & pillows are comfortable except our bed had a giant bottom sized hole on one side.

The location is perfect you are in Times Square and only a few minutes walk to main attractions.The RoomThe room was absolutely tiny but fit for purpose. Due to the sheer size of the room a lighter colour on the walls would have been better and would have given the impression of being larger in size. The grey walls were very dull and a lot of the paint work was scratched and off in places. Furthermore, the air conditioning while very good was extremely loud and hard to sleep beside. The bathroom was decent enough however there is little room to store makeup etc and it is the only place that has decent light. There is only one other mirror in the room and that is in the wardrobe door but there is no light in that area so you can barely see yourself and there is not enough room to stand back. There was room for a big mirror on the wall beside the door so it is a pity they did not have one there. Before we left we lifted the bed up as a few of my personal belongings slipped under there and it was covered in dust so it is obviously not dusted often. There was a large Panasonic television in the room which you could move and adjust this was great and lovely to be able to come back after a long day and chill in the bed watching movies etc.The LiftThe lift is tiny and once again really dark inside. A lighter colour, better air con and maybe more mirrors would help. I was nervous in this lift as it was tiny and it would be hell if you were to get stuck. Furthermore, the lifts took ages to come down. You could be in the corridor waiting for ten minutes before the lift would come down to you. Not enough lifts for the amount of floors and people using them. We were on the 14th floor so using the stairs wasn't really an option.StaffOn arrival the staff were not very nice. I cannot remember the lady we were dealing with but she gave us barely any eye contact and very little information. We had to ask her where the lifts were as they weren't obvious and she replied rudely and then just turned to talk to her colleagues. (they were so small they look like doors with the Gallivant sign on it). The staff were not informative at all or helpful when asking for directions etc. They didn't seem to want to help at all. However, there was one lady an older lady who was lovely and gave us some kind advice when we were going to buy a new suitcase (my boyfriends case had burst) and she let us check out two hours late as well due to the fact we had to go buy a new case etc. This was very kind. If only all the staff had been like this lady our stay would have been more pleasant.WifiThe WiFi service was average. At times it stopped working and would come up error. Wasn't strong enough to load videos from Facebook etc.Smoke AlarmThe smoke alarm outside our room on the 14th floor was all wires and had obviously been taken out. There were more alarms on the floor but was a bit unsettling to see this as smoke alarms are so important especially when your 14 floors up.I would stay here again however it would be nice if some adjustments were made especially to the lifts. They are only small things but would make such a difference to the place. Furthermore, it costs the staff nothing to be pleasant so it would be nice if some of there attitudes changed.","Wexford, Ireland",7,3.0

The location is great - very near to Time Square and Hells Kitchen which we loved. We seem to have gotten 'lucky' with our room size as the room itself was absolutely fine in size, although the bathroom was very small so it's one in one out. We did have a problem with our first room where the blind was broken, but they quickly moved us to a different room when they couldn't fix or replace it so they handled that well. There has been some modification to the room - new bathroom suite, new wallpaper, new flooring which is great but they just need to do a little bit more to get it up to scratch really. The furniture is obviously being re-used from when it was run by a previous company, and the bathroom door had a big chunk taken out of it at the bottom so really needed replacing. And although the bathroom suite had been modified the water pressure was pretty terrible so no chance of a quick shower and although they provide complimentary shampoo and conditioner, there is no shower gel. Some of the other things are a bit annoying but can't really be helped especially as it's an old building. So lifts are slow and small. Yes it can be noisy but it's NY and the hotel can't do much about that, and we found it didn't really affect us much (although we were on the 13th floor so nice and high up). The addition of air conditioning units adds to the noise but again this is very typical of NY. Our second room had a much smaller, quieter and more efficient ac unit than the first which we were greatful for.But the bed was comfy - we had a great sleep and in NY that's the most important thing as you spend little time in the room.

We paid a little less on Booking.com with the exception of paying before we got there and having no option of cancellation so all together the hotel cost us around £1,100 with tax which is extremely reasonable for New York.On arrival, we were told that we had been ungraded to a bigger room if this was true I was pleased because the room we stayed it was still rather small(Queen Room)! Which wouldn't have been an issue if we were only staying a few days, however this was our own fault so I would reccomended a larger room when staying for a week for extra comfort. We arriving in our room, the air conditioning was leaking leaving a sizeable puddle, sadly the man at reception forgot to tell us the number to call for reception and we had to go back down to ask for a new room. The man gave us a new key for a new room which didn't work! So another trip down to reception was required to sort that out, not ideal after 15 hours of travelling. The room was comfortable, we did have a few issues with hot water and the air con was very noisy. Apart from that, we were very impressed with housekeeping who had our room clean by 11am most mornings and who were very friendly. As for the location, I cannot think of a more perfect place to stay.

After gettting through this starting-problems, we had no more trouble with the rooms. It was a lack of heated water though, and the dockingstation/clockradio was outdated in all four rooms.

Yes, if you choose to stay in the Times Square there will always be an element of this, but the building is very poorly looked after and none of the windows seal. This let's in lots of noise that just shouldn't be the case, almost like there is no barrier to the outside. and if you stand no chance of sleeping in a hotel what's the point?Secondly - the rooms. They feel tired and grubby, and the ceiling and walls have marks where condensation has run down them. Just a bit gross really. Lots of the lightbulbs weren't working.The service from staff is brisk and generally not very friendly, which I found unusual compared to stays elsewhere in NYC.Lastly- the resort fee thing is just stupid. It's clearly an added charge to just squeeze extra cash from guests, and it's very confusing and absolutely caused complaints from others while I was in reception.All in all, you're better off looking elsewhere.",,30,2.0

After the heating issue was ""fixed"" the room turned into a sauna. No matter what temperature the thermostat was set to, it would shift to 79 degrees.

There was a lot wrong with this hotel experience and it was the worst I've ever had. Every good reviewer here that I have seen booked one of the more spacious rooms that are highly expensive such as the penthouse which is $715 dollars a night. I shouldn't have to pay for so much money for a decent room. We received a standard king bed room with a rollaway bed since we were a group of 4. The staff also recommended this room for us. Service initially seemed amazing. We got to the room and it was extremely small. The photos we saw of the room differed SIGNIFICANTLY from the picture. From the bedding on the sheets to the actual sizes of the beds itself. They most likely took most of their pictures from just their penthouse suites or family rooms and posted on the hotel to look good. We literally could barely fit our luggage in the room without having to trip over them (each of us had 1 standard suitcase and a small book bag). We couldn't control the heating. Your options were either extra toasty or crispy burnt bacon. We had to open and close the window almost every two hours throughout the night to get optimal temperatures. In the middle of the night we heard clanging noises from inside of the walls, which kept us up for an hour. I notified the front desk that we would be leaving after that night and check out. Everything was fine and we got to a much spacious hotel that was definitely worth our buck (Hotel Pennsylvania). However, when I got back home I see that I was charged over 400 dollars because they charged me for the two more nights we obviously didn't stay for! I've called countless times and no one could properly answer me besides the fact that their system says that I stayed the whole 3 nights I planned to stay. They would constantly redirect me to accounting and I will ALWAYS get sent to voicemail. I called every hour or two to see when accounting would come in and 5-6 hours later, THEY STILL AREN'T THERE. At this point, I can no longer get a hold of anyone at all! And it wasn't because the line was busy, but there was no one there at all to even answer the front desk! This is extremely unacceptable no matter how you look at the situation. If you are getting a standard room, IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!! For 658 dollars and some change, I expected much more from the hotel than this and the person reading this review can find a better room for equal or much cheaper that is actually worth it.

She checked us in swiftly and we were on our way. This Tuesday NYC was hit with major snow and ice. After our show was canceled we really didn't know what to do. No museum were open, NYC was rather quiet. My daughters boots decided to go,leaving us with not many options for dinner. The hotel has a Korean restaurant on one side and a Chinese restaurant on the other. We went with the pho/ Korean restaurant. It was tasty and affordable. The reason we did? Another Galvant staff member. He told us about both restaurants in detail. Kind, friendly African American male. Sadly I missed his name but he was amazing. The rooms are small but for myself and a 8 year old it wasn't bad at all. Tv worked, shower was clean and hot and the bed was comfortable. Because of the impact of the storm we were notified that housekeeping wouldn't be able to service us but for one night, who cares lol. There were towels and toiletries left out for guest on each floor and staff were around to help. I would totally stay here again. It's in a great location. Turn left and you have diners and the train, turn right and you are in the middle of Times Square! As we left, my daughter wanted a souvenir from the hotel. I was hoping to buy her the pin that many staff wore. Sadly they weren't for sale but Suny to the rescue! She gave my daughter hers.

Facilities in room were ok there was free coffee and free safe use which was nice, shower was OK but room had no bath, bed was on the small side there was no way it was a queen bed which we had paid for. If your a light sleeper then I'd advise strongly against this hotel, it wasn't even about the noise outside as again you can't help this, it was the paper thin walls I could hear the next room screw up a piece of paper this is how thin the walls were so just factor this in as it appears to be most rooms and can be extremely annoying and kept me up for the first 2 nights! If you want breakfast same yourself for 2mins down the road don't pay $20US in the restaurant attached as it's so not worth it. Overall an average hotel for its facilities I would choose somewhere else to stay purely on the fact of the room and the noise coming through the walls.","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",12,3.0

Then we were woken up in the middle of the night; several times during our stay. You can literally hear EVERYTHING people say and do in theirs rooms…. And when the doors shut they are so loud it will definitely wake you up – every time… This was probably the worst thing of the entire stay.When we asked questions the people at the reception made us feel like we were annoying. Not very welcoming. We asked for a late check out; the best they could do was ONE hour later.. So we had to stay in the lobby for about 7 hours with a manager starring at us to make sure we didn’t lay down. We had to pay for them to keep our bags in a room which I find ridiculous – it’s a locked room in the hotel, ive never had any other hotel charge me for this service. And to top it off, when we come home they’ve charges our card with 115 dollars in “urban fees” which i first though must be a mistake. They did not inform us with this information upon arrival which I think they most definitely should have done. The hotel interior in the lobby looks very cheap as well (my personal opinion..). Positives:The vietnamese restaurant next door. And the cleaning staff do a good job. The location is good, but DO not eat around this area; first day we paid over 80 dollars for a breakfast for 2 people…. All in all, the hotel is ok, with some major flaws. Not worth the prize.

I inhaled second hand smoke for 4 days. Shower broke on second last day and had to shower in a different room two days in a row after 90 minutes of a plumber attempting to unblock the overflowing drain and pleading with reception to give me access to a different shower. Asked for an extra blanket on three nights to no avail as the room was Baltic. Froze for 4 nights and had no shower for two. Single paned glass on a busy NYC street means very loud and cold room. Window froze one night so had to breathe in cigarette smoke for the night and no fresh air. Reception were not interested. Asked reception for cups to make coffee in an attempt to heat up one particularly cold night and was told to wait in my room and the cups never arrived - surprise surprise. Had to go out in -5C weather and get coffee instead. They don't care about their customers at all. The elevator and surrounding areas smelled like weed too! When making a complaint re the above, I was told the general manager Ben would call me on Monday morning and I didn't get a call. Again, surprise surprise!

It really has an interesting main lobby area. Although small it was quite fancy and great change from the typical Marriotts and Hiltons normally stay in when traveling.Checkin was fast and easy, and staff were friendly. I do not understand the deposit you need to place when checking in. I payed by credit card so shouldn't have had to pay a deposit. But oh well, money was returned on checkout.Elevator was really neat. It is very tiny and classic old which adds to the character of the hotel.The room was really nice in appearance and well furnished however there was just enough room to squeze around the bed on all 3 sides. Had to put luggage on bed everytime I needed to put something out. The washroom was even smaller, have to sqeeze to the side if you need to close the door. The size of the room was amusing but did not bother me and actually felt really cozy. This is NYC and realestate is expensive. BTW I have stayed at a couple of other hotels and while rooms were bigger they are all small in the older buildings.Did not see any bugs or bed bugs and I always do look the room over when traveling regardless of where I go.Did not notice any noise at night and was facing front of hotel 5th floor corner room, most lower rooms in all hotels are typically noisey in NYC.I would stay here again as price was great and location better.It is a 2-3 minute walk to the heart of times square and lots of restaurants and bars if you so desire.It is in the center of the city so if you like to venture on foot as I do in the evenings just walk in any direction and be amazed.Did take a walk to Central Park however it was night and dark so did not go in and do not suggest doing so.

First of all, I have never in my life been treated so poorly by someone who is your first point of contact at a hotel. I do not understand how she is still employed, especially at the front desk. She should be collecting the garbage instead in my opinion. To top management - do yourselves a favour and find her replacement ASAP. There are so many people unemployed that would contribute to the hotel in a positive way - Suny is so patronising and full of bad attitude. Monkeys could do a better job. The hotel location was good. The bed was comfortable, however the room did not look anything like the photos (as mentioned by other reviewers, room was small and lighting was horrible). And, be aware of additional charges that they do not tell you before you book. There is a $15.00 mandatory urban fee (excluding tax) which is a scam to me. It apparently covers the use of the business centre, fitness centre and WI-FI. If you look on the website, it says wi-fi is complimentary...so i don't understand why it is additional. I did mention this to the assistant manager however she made up some lame excuse that it says clearly on the website. Wi-fi was slow anyway. Also, if you leave your bags after checkout you have to pay $2.00 a bag.

The entrance to the hotel was great, clean and reception staff friendly. However, when we arrived at the room it was very tiny and did not resemble the photos online and shown by the travel agent. The double bed with small, there was only one bedside table on one side and the other side was about one foot from the wall, couldn't walk up beside it to get into bed had to crawl up from the bottom. The wardrobe was tiny and made even smaller by having an ironing board in there and the only place to put the suitcases. There was a chest of drawers to put clothes but the top was taken up with tea and coffee facilities so there was nowhere to put toiletries or makeup. One stool so had to sit on the bed. The bathroom again was tiny and the shower was open so the water came out onto the floor. The shower was not hot on the first morning but after contacting reception this was sorted quickly. Lighting in the room was very poor, it was spot lights down the side of the window so when I was sat in/on the bed I couldn't read the maps or guides.

Staff were VERY friendly, allowed an early check-in, fixed the broken heat quickly. Room was small but who spends a lot of time in the room while visiting NYC? Bed was very comfortable.

First impressions of the hotel were great, the location, could actually not be much better. We found that being so close to Times Square gave some excellent options when it came to food, shopping or sightseeing. The lobby/reception is impeccable when it comes to cleanliness, appearance and mood. It comes across as a really classy place. Check-in was swift and we got an upgrade to a room with a bigger bed, all for free. 2 items worth mentioning here, there was a $125 charge made to my credit card for 'security deposit' (would have been nice if this had been mentioned to us at check in, not three days into our stay when we queried it), second item to mention here is the $250 charge if you smoke in your room (I will pick this up in a moment).The room was tiny, I've seen bigger toilet cubicles. The lighting was horrific, spot lighting didn't line up with anything in the room, and opening the blinds did nothing as we were on the third floor at the back, so we looked directly into a tiny courtyard. This did have a plus point, it was extremely quiet. Another small point on this room, the heater didn't work, so it was really quite cold.Now, the smoking charge. On our third day in the room, we noticed a rather strong smell of smoke in the bathroom, it seemed to be coming from the extraction vent. Upon complaining to the front desk, we got ourselves another room to move to, this was on the 5th floor facing the street. Excellent we thought. Lighting was much better, room was bigger. But why have the $250 charge in place if you aren't actively going to stop people smoking in the hotel. The exact words of the guy on the front desk were ""it's not you, we know that, don't worry"". Not to mention that quite frequently when moving from our room to the lift the was a really strong smell of cannabis, that was most unpleasant. A bit of a let down to be honest, but at the time, we thought we had got the better end of the deal...Wrong! The second room may well have been bigger and better lit, but there was a rather large gap better the top of the window frame and the wall it is supposed to attach to. This made any noise from outside, become inside. It also made the room as cold as outside, which in January, is seriously cold, overnight, we were looking at -4c / 24.8f with the worlds thinnest duvet/comforter.Overall the hotel was poor but the fact you are in New York City (so you aren't really in the room much) and the location for outweighs the misgivings of the hotel. For the price, it would have expected a little more but then again, I did book based on the misleading photos.","Oxford, United Kingdom",5,3.0

We were not told any information on check out, wifi, breakfast they offered etc. All the dark hair man cared about was getting a credit card details from us which we weren't told we would need from our travel agent. Lucky we had a debit card available at hand as none of us even own credit cards. After he snatched the card from my hand and swiped it he told us that $125 would be charged to the card. We were then given the room keys and told it's room 605 and shooed off. No customer service whatsoever. We had to go down the night before check out to ask for the check out time where an African American girl working on reception gave us a weird look and told us 12pm. She never even thought to ask why we weren't told, she was again very rude.Check out was even worse, this time we were greeted by a blonde hair women (again no name badge) who was very rude and just asked us our room number and never offered if we wanted our bags stored away. While we waited for our shuttle to come pick us up we noticed that every other guest that checked out after us was asked if they wanted to store their luggage.The housekeeping staff were the nicest, most friendliest staff in the whole building! They would greet you and have a small chat with you, and made you feel far more welcome to the hotel. However, the rooms weren't as spotless as you'd expect. On the 3rd day my sister found a cum covered sock underneath her bed. It was very unpleasant.Another complaint was the noise coming from the air con/heaters they would make a racket noise every 30mins-1hour. It's was sort of a loud bang, very annoying. we were at the back of the hotel and every night and day you could hear the noise of fans turning from the building next to the hotel. I suggest you bring ear plugs if your a light sleeper. Another point to mention, was that as soon as it hit 5pm there was this displeasing smell of deep fried food that somehow got into the room, but there was no windows open and we never even ate in the room.

However I cannot fault the Security Guard who was there in a flash trying to fix the problem for us.The room was tiny and the bed was the smallest double bed I've ever seen! It would've fit 2 small hobbits!Our room was on the 14th floor and it was absolutely boiling hot all the time even with the air conditioning on full blast (very old system - not temperature controlled). The lights and plasma tv give off so much heat as well, try to turn them off before you leave the room!We didn't get any water in our room and when I went down to ask reception if we could have some I was told we didn't pay the ""urban resort fee"", which included bottles of waster, turned out we did but when this was discovered on the last day there was never any water left when we asked. I know it's just water but if I've paid for it as part of these extortionate ""resort fees"", I'd at least expect some left in my room or available on request at reception. We didn't eat in the hotel however breakfast is available and there's a Chinese next door. We didn't use the gym or other facilities either so can't comment on them.We paid $2 per bag to store them for a few hours which I think was a bit tacky but just another way to make some cash. There's a hotel airport shuttle which was $55 per couple and ran every 30 mins. We weren't aware of this or told of this until we saw the sign leaving the hotel. We got an uber from/to JFK and it cost around $60-65 each way.The location is great, so close to Times Square! And going by some of the other reviews of it being noisy....off course it's noisy, it's a hotel next to one of the busiest tourist attractions on the planet in the city that never sleeps, pack some ear plugs or stay Uptown!The reception staff weren't particularly nice, every query/question/small request I had they weren't able to help. Never asked how our stay was when checking out, no one to speak to about the issues above.Overall you get what you pay for, be sure to check the resort fees and what you actually get with it.As a base for NYC it serves its purpose but I don't think we'd stay here again.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom",18,3.0

We both found the male staff to be more efficient and friendly as opposed to the female staff who just seemed annoyed that they were at work however on the whole the hotel was pretty good and on the way back to the airport the hotel sorted us out a limo with a company they work alongside. Dont really see what all the awful reviews are about, people expecting far too much from such a decent priced hotel. Couldnt fault the maintenance as our toilet was blocked and it was fixed within minutes. Couple of heads up though - there will be millions of bus tour and comedy ticket salesmen in times square which get really annoying, try and catch a new york islanders hockey match in brooklyn as its a nice change of scene and there will be plenty of people who seem friendly enough in times square - such as people giving u mixtapes or dressed in costumes- but really just want some money (they can spot a tourist a mile off!)

Like most NYC hotels, rooms and amenities are compact, but our ""suite"" was quite spacious by those standards. We stayed on the 5th floor and had a street view; nothing too impressive, but better than the view of the alleyway, dumpsters, and heating units I've experienced at other hotels. We had one full bed- quite comfortable, and a bunk bed down the ""hall"" in the suite, which worked well for our family. The sleeping areas each had a TV. The room offered a small mini refrigerator and in-room coffee. The only criticism I would offer is the lack of parking. A convenient lot was directly across the street, which offered a discount to guests. Unfortunately, that lot was full, so we were forced to pay $70/night to park with no compensation/discount.

The Gallivant was not as “swanky” as the first hotel, but it amazes me how the people can make up for anything. The hotel was nice, but the kicker came when we were checking in and my grandson met the front desk person, Cassandra. They chatted a while and I remember her reaching her hand over the desk to shake his hand and introduce herself. The next morning, we walked by the desk, and Cassandra said “Good morning, Will”. That’s his name, she remembered and it made his day! As recently as today I heard him say he liked the Gallivant better! Again amazing. The only negative I could find was the help at the buffet. I wanted to charge to my room all I heard was it will cost too much, tried cc, she said no. The woman really wanted cash for some reason.

Our family room was plenty big enough for our group of four adult women friends (and their suitcases, and later, Macy's bags!). With two double beds and a set of bunk beds, there was a (very comfortable) bed for everyone. The room was clean and well serviced each day. We were on the 14th floor, so well away from street and traffic noise and we could even glimpse the Hudson from our window. The bathroom was nice and big, no problem with the shower and fresh towels each day. Staff on the front desk were welcoming and friendly although we did wonder whether the concierge had yet to attend the same customer service training...? The lift must have had an MOT, as there were no delays on that front either.

We paid $139 per night which is a bargain in Times Square. Decor is very nice and appealing. However there were a couple of hiccups. The bathroom is tiny, and when we turned on the shower the handle fell to the floor. We had to attach it back to the wall and carefully turn to get water. Once the water was flowing, there is no shower door, and water was splashing all over the bathroom floor and created a river that was headed to the hallway. I had to use the towels to sop up the water and wring out. The last mention is the window had a translucent roll up screen, but no room darkening curtains so it was fairly light in the room throughout the night. And when dawn broke we could not sleep any longer. During the night the fire trucks came by with sirens and horns blaring which added to the experience. Turns out the fire station is around the corner. It was loud, but hey it's NYC so we deal with it.Still a deal at the price, but perhaps adding room darkening, sound insulating blinds and a little maintenance and this hotel can be the best deal on Broadway.

Upon arrival, I checked in with the receptionist behind the desk. He was informative & professional, but definitely not welcoming. We then went up to the 'premium room’ so we could drop off our bags & start our vacation. Imagine our disappointment combined with disgust as we walked around the room & found strands of long, black hair on the floor by the mirror, not 1, but 2 pieces of chewed up gum (1 on the floor by the bunk bed & 1 on the radiator), a take-out container in the fridge filled with smelly food from the prior occupant and a business card, a receipt from Banana Republic & an adhesive label from a garment all found under the bunk bed. This was all discovered within less than 5 minutes of us opening the door. I am sure we would have found other 'gifts' if we continued. We immediately called the front desk & were told that someone would come up to our room. After waiting 10 minutes, we decided we could wait no longer as this was supposed to be our vacation & time was being wasted waiting unnecessarily. We brought down the food, business card & receipt to the front desk. As I approached the same gentleman who checked us in he said, ""You brought me some food?!"" I explained what we found & showed him pictures of the gum & hair. He apologized & upgraded us to the 'family room'. (This was the room I originally wanted to book but when I called, was told it was unavailable.) He also gave us vouchers for free breakfast (which was absolutely delicious). The family room was nicely appointed with 2 bunk beds & 2 queen beds. As there were only 3 of us, we wanted to push up the top bunk against the wall so the person on the bottom would not bump her head. We soon realized this could only be done with a special key, so we called the front desk. A nice man from housekeeping came & tried to force the bunk into place. He could not & said he would let maintenance know to come up with the key to lock the bed into the wall......we are still waiting for maintenance to come....Upon checkout, we had to pay a $15.00 'urban fee' per night. This fee is for access to the business center (this was a girls weekend trip, not business, so we never used said business center), Wi-Fi (according to The Gallivant website, it clearly states ""free Wi-Fi, high-speed internet) , access to fitness center (never used it) & 2 complimentary bottles of water upon arrival (didn't even get 1 bottle). I should have disputed the charge but I didn't, as at that point I just wanted to leave the hotel.Needless to say, we will not be coming back. I have never encountered such blatant filth in a hotel room. Also, the corridors were made even more narrow by the fact that the 2 maids cleaning carts were always parked by the elevators. A first we thought it was because they were still making up the rooms, but the carts never moved from the hallway the entire time we were there. It made the area by the hallway look like a janitors closet...cramped & untidy.","Warwick, New York",8,1.0

There was a small fridge in the room, a desk, coffeemaker, and 2 chairs. There was plenty of room for the 2 of us and our luggage. We got there early , and our luggage was kept safe for us until we could go back and check in. The nights were extremely loud, and it was difficult to sleep, but this is in no way the hotel's fault. (it's NYC, and it is loud outside; bring ear plugs). The staff were wonderful with any requests and always friendly when we passed by the front desk.

Once I got there to check-in and asked about proving my member number is when I was told that Wyndham have not been associated with this property since July 2016.The bed is comfortable but the pillows are awful. The noise level is very loud. The hotel is located near a bar that does not close until 2:00am. Therefore, trying to sleep was a challenge even with my room being on the 7th floor. Overall the room was very clean but if I was staying for more than one night. I would have left and stayed someplace else.

The room we had was average, really bad mirror lighting in the bathroom with no room to out anything, so we out the coffee stand near the fridge in the bathroom to put our toothbrushes and amenities.

Various parts of the room was dirty, dust piled in the corners, electrical and light switch covers were dirty.The bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. The doors to the room is metal, so when it closes, it slams shut. My key card didn't work on 3 occasions and had to have it reswiped, which was inconvenient because I had to catch that slow elevator. When in the hall or near the elevator, you can hear people talking, singing in the shower etc, so noise proof is out the door cause with the TV off, you can hear other people talking coming from the hall in their rooms.Our 3rd night the smoke alarm went off around midnight for 20 minutes. I called operator and front desk and the phones were dead. Then we could hear through an intercoms for everyone to stay in there rooms, there is no fire but alarm problems.Overall, the location is good, but I would probably stay at the Crown Plaza across the street, or Intercontinental couple blocks away.

We had read reviews about being on a much higher floor but did not ask. The reviews about the size of the room were not exaggerated. It is small. It has a bed, 2 side tables (that has a top and a bottom, no draws) and a dresser where the TV is. The closet is also on the small size as well, so we kept most of our clothes in the suitcase. There was no view (only pipes). There is a safe and iron -board w/iron in the closet. There is no space for shoes so I just put the shoes by the wall. The bathroom is small as well. The area around the sink cannot hold a lot of stuff, so I had to put most of my toiletries below. I could not wash my face with the door close as my hand kept hitting the door handle. The shower had no curtain and there is glass on only the left side blocking the toilet. I thought I was missing something and kept looking to close the glass door but yes, the glass only covered half of the shower, so if the showerhead is set up high, water will splash onto the floor. The water pressure was great.With all of these things, I had a wonderful time. As I told my husband, who comes to NY to stay in their rooms. The bed was comfortable, we slept like babes and my husband is a light sleeper. Because we were on the 3rd floor, we did not have to wait for the elevator unless we want to, as we took the stairs. The lobby was not very busy at times so my hubby and I sometimes just sat and chat. There was one big issue and that was with towels. Somehow they ran out of towels. Apparently, someone does the laundry and did not arrive on time so we had no bath towels for an entire night, which I beat myself about as if I had had the room clean, chances are I might have had towels. Instead we had to use the face towels. But we got bath towels the next morning.We had breakfast there, but the booth seating there is very uncomfortable. I thought breakfast was expensive but it is comparable to places around NY, although I hated paying so much for orange juice when she was simply pouring it out of a Tropicana container, but you can go back for as much as you want.By the way, parking is very expensive so if you have family in NY, park your car there. The self-parking is across the road but it is $45 per day. Also, there is a small spot directly in front of the hotel to unload. The hotel is very close to a lot of things so you don't really need a car.They have a concierge so we got tickets from her to go sightseeing on one of the buses.

We got a dirt cheap price off Hotwire & overall we were thrilled with the low cost. N.B. This is a typical NY hotel, meaning the rooms are small. Space is at a premium. It does have some bad points: 1. Security. Yeah, there is a guy in the lobby but he didn’t appear too effective. The elevators don’t require a key card to activate. That means anybody can just get in & go upstairs. The hotel really needs to upgrade the elevators. 2. The walls are thin. We could hear everything. On the 8th floor we could even hear some of the noise from Times Square. 3. The bathroom especially the shower is tiny. If you are a “fluffy” person do not stay in this hotel. Seriously, we’ve had larger bathrooms on cruise ships 4. There are dings in the walls5. The room needed a chair. Didn’t have to be a big one but someplace to sit other than the bed would have been nice It does have good points: 1.

When using the app we looked to your ratings for guidance, with respects to the quality and level of service we would receive. For this booking I must say that the description of the property wasn't correct at all. This property should receive a -5 star rating at best. Not only was the room not what we expected based on description, but we had our personal items stolen, the bedding was filthy, the room was much smaller than we were told, the staff was rude, the amenities listed weren't available, the wifi didn't work, and on more than one occasion our room keys didn't work - and we had to wait anywhere from 15 to 30 minuets for the front desk person to return so our keys could be changed.

The rooms were clean, the shower was hot and good pressure, the beds comfy and the TV's were bigger and more modern than lots of resorts I've stayed in. The only downfall to the room was that yes you can hear everything in the streets and the doors all slam.The location is perfect! Steps to time square, walking distance to the Rockefeller, Central Park and the Empire State Building and Macy's.

We needed a family room for 5 that was close to the main attractions of NYC, we couldn't have picked any better! For just over £200 a night, this hotel - located on 48th St- was just around the corner from Times Square but didn't have any noise associated with the area! We arrived late at night, check in was seamless, we dumped the bags and went straight out. The kids were in awe of the place and the hustle and bustle. The room is well equipped with coffee maker, fridge, safe, iPod docking station and flat screen TV. The bathroom was HUGE!! the shower was superb, the only draw back was no shower gel (although soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion are provided). We had 2 double beds, and a set of bunk beds. All were comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. The AC was a welcome addition to the 31C heat but it was a little noisy when trying to sleep. There's a fire station located just behind the hotel, to be honest it never bothered us and we only heard it once during our stay. I know other reviewers have complained about the mouse from here. Check out again was seamless, and you can store your bags for $2 per item until you leave for the airport. Check out is great at 12pm do you can get sorted without rushing about at the last minute. In all a great stay, not a 5* stay but great for the price and location. ",,73,4.0

I called the lobby and told them they made a mistake. Went back down to the lobby and requested for double beds and the receptionist said no sorry we are out, then I said what about a king bed? She then said don't have any of those either. But I never saw her actually checking the system. Then I asked for a room that at least it didn't smell like smoke. We got another room but these rooms are made for only one occupant. The space is so small luckily we were only going to be there one day so we had our small carry-on bags if we were there for a longer period of time we would feel claustrophobic . The room was clean and had some renovations as well. But still very small. The bed is not made for two people as soon as you sit down the bed sinks in and I'm not talking like a tempurpedic bed would but more like a deflated air mattress.

As a regular traveller to New York I usually stick to the same hotels but was lured by the price of the Gallivant. What I thought was a good deal combined with the location led me to cancel my other hotel and book this one. Unfortunately however my booking was cancelled by the hotel less than 24 hours before my arrival. I received no warning emails and the first I knew was when I logged in to get the address and saw it was cancelled. Due to already being on route to NY I was panicked and rebooked despite it costing me €127 more than my original booking. Upon arrival I was given room 300. Unfortunately the safety deposit box wasn't working so the maintenance guys busted it open (I am pretty sure there must be a reset button instead of the forceful method that was used!) After destroying the safe they moved me to room 908 which seemed ok at first at least it had a working safe. However, after a great first day I returned to my hotel room to find that the bulbs in two of the lamps are blown including the one beside the bed in addition to this two of the ceiling lights also needed bulbs which made it pretty difficult to see anything in one section of the room. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse I stepped into the shower the next morning to find the ceiling covered in small flying ant type creatures! Needless to say I spent as little time as possible in the hotel. The hotel has so much potential and the location is excellent but for the same price I could get a nearby hotel with working lights and no bugs.

This hotel is a little bit hard to find and the signage that is shown in the photos is not in place. A quick visit to Google maps and you will not have an issue in finding this hotel.From the moment we checked in we had great customer service. We arrived early in the morning and we met with bell services where they took our bags and we worked with them to valet our car for the three days we were staying. It was worth the extra $10 a day to not have the worries or issues with parking the car. We were receipted for the car and off we went to explore.We arrived back around 2PM and we were surprised to find out that both of our rooms were ready. We have a double room and a premium room that had a King size bed and bunk beds around a half wall. The room was comfortable and the beds were some of the best we have slept on at any hotel. Be advised the rooms are small but for the purposes of your trip they are perfect. We had excellent maid service as our rooms were cleaned and ready everyday before noon. We have often tipped the maid service and we did so on this trip. When we came back to the room on the second day, we were given a ""thank you"" on the pad where I left the note with the tip. I have never had a maid thank us for the tip. Nice touch!The elevators are small but fit the size of the property. We had issues only once in getting on but it was in the heat of the day and most were either coming or going. Staying on the fourth floor, it was a simple walk to the lobby.Since this is a ""boutique"" hotel, there isn't complimentary breakfast but options next store (which attached to the hotel) offer both continental breakfast as well as a buffet option. While we didn't take advantage of either, the pricing and offerings looked great.What I really loved about this hotel was the proximity to both Times Square as well as Broadway.

The rooms looked to have been recently renovated with recessed lighting, faux wood floors, flat screen TVs, and tasteful wall coverings. Bed was comfortable, bedding was nice, and room was very clean. Great location at a good price. Nice that they have free access to internet in the lobby as we had to print out boarding passes for return flight. Rooms were quiet facing front where we were. Street noise wasn't bad at all.Curious that the hotel doesn't have a sign on it, maybe that's in the works. Without a sign, we kept walking by it especially returning at night, so we used the Vietnamese restaurant next door as a landmark. Also, the showers have panels with no door, so the bathroom floor floods anytime you bathe (and we tried very hard not to). We dried off and then used the towels on the floor. And yes, you will end up waiting for one of the two small elevators. Fine if you aren't in a hurry.Staff was friendly and attentive.

We said to her that we were fine and that we would just wait in the foyer as we were too tired to go anywhere.

The standard rooms were so small we could barely fit ourselves in- we opened the door to the closet and it hit the bed, we had to back into the bathroom to use the toilet. Luckily this was only for one night. The next day the hotel offered to move us, they gave us no warning and a porter arrived at the door demanding our bags, we were in the middle of getting ready and had just showered so I asked him to come back in half an hour. He wasn't happy about this. The new rooms were slightly bigger and very comfortable. We had a nice view as well. We didn't spend too much time in the room after that as we were out sightseeing every day, but I did have to pick some items off the floor and as I did I noticed a lot of dirt gathered around the edges of the room and in the corners- it needed a good clean.

It was almost like they didn't know they worked at a hotel the gossip between each other was at times interesting. I doubt they have a manager on staff. The hallways are dark and usually packed with dirty laundry and trash. The elevators were horrible very small and slow. To make it worse they use the guest elevator to take the dirty laundry and trash down. We went for breakfast at the restaurant which is really a Chinese restaurant . Don't waste your time there the food was god awful and cold. There is another Asian restaurant also connected which is a good place for dinner or lunch.

When I declined his suggestion and told him that we would prefer to take a cab as it would be a) quicker - the shuttle came once every hour and would then stop at every terminal, and b) cheaper - NYC yellow taxi cabs have a fixed rate of $52.50 which including the toll charge and tip would have been $70 at the most to and from JFK to Manhattan.

The Gallivant was formerly the TRYP Time Square Central but recently changed hands. It was still the TRYP when we made the reservation. We have stayed at the TRYP by Wyndham Times Square South near Penn Station on previous trips to the city, and it’s a great hotel. First off, The Gallivant location can’t be beat. You’re in the heart of the Theater District and it’s a quick two block walk to two different subway line stations. We arrived at Newark Airport, took the NJ Transit train to New York Penn Station, the subway two stops to 50th Street, and then walked back to 48th street to our hotel. As others have stated, because it recently changed names, there’s no signage but it’s still very easy to find. When we departed, we flew out of JFK so we just walked back to the blue subway line on 50th and took the subway all of the way to the JFK AirTrain station in Queens. If you utilize the 50th Street Station, there’s no elevator, so you have to carry your luggage down three flights of stairs. However, you can walk six blocks south to the Port Authority Bus Station on 42nd where there’s a lift, and take the same subway line to JFK.The hotel rooms are small as are most hotel rooms in the Big Apple but very modern with ample storage. The Free Wi-Fi is fast and the large flat Panel TV offers many channels. Being in the middle of Time Square there are hundreds of restaurants and lots of shopping in every direction.The only minor negative is the staff which are less than friendly and not at all accommodating. We had minimal interaction with them so it didn’t bother us.I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again at a rate under $200.","Las Vegas, Nevada",29,4.0

Foul sewage odor in bathroom 2. Mildew stained shower walls3. Mold on shower curtain. 3. Flies coming from drain They were apologetic but would not be able to address until the next day and offered to comp breakfast which I passed on.(Placed the shower curtain in the hallway to alleviate the room stench)- Hotel authorized a hold on my cc OVER the standard $25 deposit I thought was authorized.(Uncovered this after reviewing my cc bills)Day 2- Replaced putter fabric shower curtain but no plastic interior curtain- Staff said they would clean bathroom and address fliesDay 3- Asked for fridge again and finally got one- Alerted the front desk of excess charges that I didn't authorize . They said it was a ""system issue.""- I asked Felix ""guest services"" agent, to kindly resolve the issue by Utilizing that UNauthorized amount already taken from my acct. towards :a. $25 nightly deposit feeb. rate for tonight c. OR allow me to use cash for the $25 deposit........due to the HOTEL's ""system error"" absorbing my available balance Felix's replied: ""It wasn't us it was the system. But we already released the unauthorized amount. You have to call your bank and ask them to put it back on your cc."" Felix continued with ""We already released it so if it's on hold it's your bank not us.""First of all....- If the ""system"" is to blame, is it not the Gallivant Hotel whose responsibility it is to implement a ""system"" that works.- Notwithstanding all ""systems"" have a margin for error; but when it causes financial burden to the hotel guest the natural reaction would be resolution oriented. Not with Felix. His reaction was not only defensive but also shifting responsibility.Second...- Telling me to call my bank and impress a sense of urgency for an expedite their process because the hotel's ""system"" made a mistake is inappropriate and unprofessional Felix failed to realize that there wouldn't be any sense of urgency to put on my bank if the mistake had not been made to begin with.Third...- He immediately refused any of the alternatives I listed; nor did he offer any apologies, compromise, resolution or compensation for the lack of :hospitalitytransparency in unauthorized/excess chargesfinancial restitutionFourth...- When I asked who HIS manager was he identified himself as the ""Hotel Manager."" I knew he wasn't the manager based on how he handled ""guest services."" It was extremely transparent how green he was based on the inability to: listen, communicate effectively, diffuse conflict-situations, and problem solve.I had to ask him again ""Who do you report to?""Then he gave the name of his mgr. To no surprise I find out Felix is the assist.I was forgiving about the moldy bathroom because at least that MOD made an attempt to compensate for the inconvenience; despite my amicable decline.I also understand that this is the Hospitality BUSINESS therefore they have policies for payment.However, it's the manager's job to train the staff to recognize opportunities to resolve issues before they escalate. My exchange with Felix was like gasoline to a flame. (The flame being drain flies in the shower). Had Felix apologized for the financial inconvenience, listened to the list of filthy accommodations I patiently endured, acknowledged how much I've already compromised on lower hotel standards and offered resolution this would be one less negative review.","Detroit, Michigan",12,1.0

We had booked this place as a treat to ourselves however I have stayed in campsites across Europe which had better staff and cleaner rooms upon check in. I checked in with Victor who was initially lovely to deal with and quickly checked us in to our room on the second floor. Upon getting into our room we were horrified. The last persons rubbish, dirty towels and dirty sheets were on the floor and table. (Photos attached) I immediately went back down and explained what was wrong and was told that they would get someone up there to clean as soon as they could. I told them that after being on a long flight and sick that I was not willing to wait around for our room to be cleaned I wanted to be moved. When I booked this room I let the hotel know that we would be arriving between 9-10pm so when we arrived at 10pm and our room was dirty I was not willing to then wait even longer to get into it. Victor agreed to find us a new room but the way we were spoken to after this was like we were an inconvenience. Our second room now on the 11th floor was lovely and clean, the only problem we had with it was the loud aircon which we had expected after reading previous travellers reviews. A couple of days later we returned from a day out and our loud aircon wasn't only loud now it was leaking, my clothes and a few gifts I had bought were wet, I went and spoke to reception again and the gentlemen I got (whom didn't have a name badge on) was absolutely lovely! He really saved our experience at this hotel. He moved us into a new room and got my wet clothes dry cleaned. He was friendly and genuine the whole time I dealt with him and he is a real asset to your business. When we checked out on the 16th I asked to speak to a manager about our ordeal on the first night. I explained what had happened and that I was not happy to pay for the first night as by the time they got me into a clean room I would be paying for the room for an hour. The gentlemen I spoke to, Felix, told me he could half the night and that's it. When I told him this wasn't good enough he said I can't do anything else, there is no one else here who can help you and I don't know why your room was dirty as a manager was on when you checked in. If Felix is in fact telling the truth that all he could do is wave $80 then that is a ridiculous way to run your business, if he does not have the power to wave a nights accommodation you should have someone in the building who can do so as I know for a fact other rooms had problems too (A family was complaining about a broken drain and fridge while I was checking out). As a manager of a business at home I know that the customer is always right and if someone comes in with a complaint I need to fix it fully and on this occasion my complaint was not dealt with correctly. If I handled a complaint the way that mine was handled I would be ripped into my boss. Overall I was not happy with my experience at The Gallivant Times Square however our beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were a good size. This hotel is also in a perfect location. I hope anyone staying here in the future doesn't run into any problems with their rooms as then it would in fact be a good place to stay in NYC. ",,7,2.0

The answer to this question was that it does not have one. So, unfortunately, they do not exactly have corporate standards to upheld themselves to on a daily basis. My one word to describe my experience is not even a word - it's ""Meh."" I was not generally horrified by the experience. I was not exceedingly impressed with my experience, either. I usually have an opinion one way or the other. But, for this BUSINESS visit, I do not. A business hotel it is not. The biggest plus I can give this hotel is that the wifi was FREE and generally a great signal. So, this was helpful workwise for me. The room was very small, but it was clean and furnished fine, albeit a bit confined. The bathroom was miniature. I will be honest, I picked this using the price factor as normally I would not go near Times Square. But, this seemed like a very busy weekend with rooms very scarce all over the city. That being said, NEVER expect a hotel next to Times Square to be quiet. Because of the age and location (clearly no double pane windows here), I battled with the street noise during sleep. My time away from NYC has clearly gotten me spoiled to want peace and quiet vs city traffic honking during sleep. Silly me. What outdid this noise? A family of 5 children who were clearly sharing a room on my floor. They mistook the hallway as their playground at 12:30AM. Since the doors were not soundproof either, I promptly screamed at them (as they were sans parents) and complained to the front desk (whose comment was ""we know who you're talking about""). I have no clue if it even had amenities. The front desk staff were average in help and friendliness. The halls and the lobby were clean and suffice. My last comments will be positive. The cleaning staff and concierge were friendly and great at their jobs. The bed was relatively comfortable.

When we got to our room, it smelled a little moldy and the sheets were a little damp but it was 1:30 in the morning so I didn't really care. Well, my allergies started acting up after 3 hours being in there. I couldn't sleep so I went into the bathroom and I was so freaked out. There were bugs flying around in the shower and if you looked up, there were dead bugs on the ceiling. I took a video and also a picture of the shower. Went downstairs and showed the guy that had checked us in and he was shocked as well. The bell hop guy came over and saw the video as well. They couldn't get us a room right away so the bell hop guy came back up to our room to see the bugs and I guess to see first hand. Well when we got in there, he saw the bugs and went back downstairs to share the news. The front desk guy called us right away and found a room for us to move into. This was now 5:30AM; I had not had any sleep really after driving 5 hours and not sleeping all day prior. We went from the second floor to the ninth floor. The room was a whole lot better and my allergies were so much better after an hour of not being in the other room. We tried talking to the general manager but he was unavailable and I have not heard from him at all. I left all of my information and I talked to 3 different employees that work there and they all seemed like this was the first time they were hearing about this situation. I saw the front desk guy write everything down. This is a little absurd! It's not in a bad location but I would recommend staying somewhere else unless you get a room above the 2nd level.",,0,3.0

Our room looked really cool with dark wood floors and a super modern look. Be warned, however, that the rooms (our room anyway) was pretty small. Nothing extravagant, just a bed, a desk, and a small bathroom with a TV mounted on the wall. The size was perfect for us because we weren't in there very often, but some people might like a larger room. One great thing about this hotel is the location. It's about two blocks off of the main Time's Square area which is less than a couple minutes walk. It was awesome being able to walk out of our hotel and be right in the middle of Time's Square. That was probably my favorite part of staying at this hotel.The only complaint I have about this place is that the shower doesn't really have a door on it. In our room, it was just one pane of class that didn't go all the way to the wall, so when I took a shower, a bunch of water got out onto the bathroom floor. I understand that they are trying to make the shower look modern (and are succeeding), but something more practical would have been nice.Overall, for the value, quality/look of the rooms and the location, I was impressed with this place and I would stay here again for sure.","Baltimore, Maryland",8,5.0

We were looking for something in Manhattan that was under $300 with good ratings. This hotel fit the bill. It is in a great location. Pretty close to Port Authority and the bustle of Times Square. Close to restaurants and subway stations. But far enough from Times Square that it is not crazy, chaotic, and loud 24/7. I must note that it is pretty hard to find the hotel since there is not a sign above the door. The hotel sign is several stories up, planked by other signs and can only be seen clearly at night when it is lit up. We got there at 2pm and I was very disappointed that we were not able to check in early. But we were able to securely stash our bags with the bellhop and go get something to eat in the meantime (note: check in is 3pm). Staff was very friendly. The lobby is very nicely decorated and has plenty of seating for guests waiting around the lobby. The room was the typical NYC size--enough space to turn around in place and breath but not enough to dance or pace around the room. The bathroom was comically small. It was the size of a kitchen pantry. Not a problem if you are staying one night. But if you plan to stay longer, it can be a bit annoying. The bed was comfy. The room had ample plugs. However, I was a bit annoyed that the lamp and table light on my side of the bed did not work. I didnt realize this problem until it was time for bed. I feel that I paid a lot of money for not a fully functioning room. Check out was easy. Note: I also hate hotels that give you less than 24 hours in a room--3pm check in and 12pm check out.","Stoughton, Massachusetts",17,3.0

All I can really say is this place is very, very basic. As I celebrated my 21st birthday we were upgraded to a 'Premier room', a good start or so I thought. A double bed and a bunk bed was what we were greeted with. Now, I have just come of age but the last time I slept in a bunk bed, I was 10. Hooray. We both agreed that the beds were uncomfortable, and having minor back problems I struggle to sleep on hard beds, so uncomfortable night sleeps all round. That being said, that wasn't the only problem with the sleep quality. Every night I struggled to fall asleep and stay asleep due to the horrific sounds of a tired, loud air conditioning unit. As far as I'm concerned I may as well have had someone power drilling in the same room and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference! If this is the standard of a premier room I dread to think what any other room is like.The service in the hotel was passable, the cleaners did a good job at keeping our room to a good standard, however given the fact this establishment is in New York I was pretty amazed that 90% of the staff had forgotten how to smile!

I have a normal day job where I can't be at a computer and checking my email all the time. Apparently at 1:23 pm I was sent a message from a manager from the Gallivant telling me that they didn't have a credit card on file (despite me having put in my credit information through easybooking) and that they would cancel my reservation if I didn't call them by 3 pm. That's a 1.5 hr window...during a business day...when I'm at work...THE DAY BEFORE MY STAY when I made the reservation literally 2 months beforehand.

The incompetence and absolute lack of any professionalism only got worse from there. Our card stopped working for room less than 24 hrs after being there and they had to reset.

First, it was easy to locate after coming out of the Lincoln Tunnel. Second, we were going to a play at the Kerr Theater which is directly across the street from the hotel. Yes, the rooms are tight, but that does not bother me since we only slept in the room. The only reason I gave it an ""average"" rating instead of a ""very good"" rating was for two reasons. The shade they had on the window did not block out any light which was a problem. We were planning on waking up at 7:30-8 am anyway, but the light flooding our room at 5 am made our last couple of hours of rest extremely difficult and annoying.

When we arrived instead of putting through the whole amount on my card it went through in several different transactions. I went up to my room to dump our luggage and had worked out that I still had $300 left to pay, when I went back down I was told it was over $1000 I had to pay and when I confronted them the clueless staff agreed to let me just pay the $300 without any questions. Really worrying how it went from $1000 to the correct amount $300. Half way through my holiday I had noticed that my bank account was emptied, my balance being nil, and noticed they had taken hundreds of dollars out of my account. Again, when we confronted the manager they admitted it was an accident and no explanation was given to why. It took 2 days to go back into my account so for they 2 days I had zero spending money. We spent our last day waiting 2 and a half hours on the manager because we got a bill through our door without warning and another couple of hundred dollars came out my account without my consent. We were well aware we have city tax etc to pay but when the manager eventually came down he had told us we had paid it all and had absolutely nothing to pay and the money would go back in my account. The managers attitude was disgusting, despite waiting 2 and a half hours we didn't even get an apology for waiting or for how much I had been overcharged from the very beginning. The money eventually cleared and that was fine but I was still waiting on my deposit back that I was promised would take a few days. Now we have been back for 2 weeks and $400 has been taken out of my bank account by this hotel. I have emailed the manager directly, repeatedly, to ask him to explain this and still no reply. I don't have an overdraft and because of all the money I had been overcharged for no reason I've now been charged on top of everything else for going into an overdraft which the manager said he would refund but I am still getting completely ignored.

The room had very little lighting so was very dark. he housekeeping carts were in the hall way day & night which looked terrible. One day there were no face clothes left. When housekeeping was called they came to the room & said they ran out so could leave me one. Unacceptable!

We were so looking forward to returning here for a two night stay. Luckily we knew where it was as there is no signage on the building. There was a small sign in the lobby ""The Gallivant"" but nothing to indicate we were in the Tryp Hotel that we had booked online. One person was at the desk and even though it was 10 AM she gave us room right away. We had booked a King room. We were given a closet sized room with one double bed. This was unacceptable. Back at the desk, she found us a room with a king sized bed. Luckily I had a printout of my original booking. Odd that there were no other patrons around and we were given our room so early. Our new room was so dreary. (See my photos).Walls and ceiling were painted dark grey, one wall wallpapered with grey and white street map, floor was light grey stick-on plastic made to look like laminate flooring, the view out the window was a brick wall with a fire escape, furniture consisted of one round bistro sized table, the king sized bed, one small battered three drawer dresser, one end table (doesn't work for two people) and one kitchen type chair. The flat screen TV on the wall was good but the coffeemaker didn't work, the headboard on the bed was not wide enough so if you tried to sit in bed to watch TV or read, the pillows fell through the gap behind you. The bathroom was very small with absolutely no counter space (see my photo), the shower was a good size but the glass wall only came half way across so the floor got soaked when you showered. This place feels like a prison. Very depressing. The housekeeping cart and garbage trolley sat in the very dark hallway by the elevators from the time we arrived on Wednesday until we left on Friday. (See my photos- very dark). On the plus side, the bed was comfortable, hotel very quiet, staff was friendly, excellent location close to Times Square and Broadway theatres. We were able to leave our suitcases at $2 per bag in a secure room until our flight and the doorman got us a fixed rate luxury vehicle to the airport. We had stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at 237 W54 Street our first three nights on points and loved it there. We were excited to once again stay at the hotel at 234 W48 Street for our last two nights. What a huge disappointment. We know where we'll stay next time and it won't be the Tryp/Gallivant.

The rooms are quite small, however clean and updated. Walls are paper thin and not insulated against sound at all. The front desk staff was quite taken aback when I actually engaged them for assistance, and it appeared to me they were more taken aback when required to acknowledge my presence... quite unnecessarily pretentious... Interestingly enough, I sat (prior to being assisted and subsequent of having been assisted) and did not witness anyone else being given the semi-condescending attitude i received upon my arrival (I sensed a level of bias. an ordinary person would have been uncomfortable... however Im not your ordinary traveler) Don't get me wrong, they did their job... But I guess I expect more, in the way of service, than just doing ones job.The housekeepers and maintenance staff are quite nice and genuine. They are helpful and attentive.Attention to repair detail should be taken... Sheet rock is exposed in various corners and is pulling away from the wall. (not a basic maintenance issue...

The young lady at front desk told me that she could not find my reservation because I made it 35-40 mins. earlier, tells me she cant check me in until 3pm, and so she picks up the phone (Doesnt bother to tell me where to check my bags, I had to ask... normally they're courteous enough to direct you).

So I go to the ATM that charged me $3.50 fee to take out $10, I come back and begin to hand the bell man the $10 and he THEN asks me if I was checking in or out... I said checking in and he says 'Oh, you don't have to pay'.Really... REALLY?!I came back around 5pm because I figured a ton of people would try to check in at the same time.

The room was bright, clean and spacious. The bathroom is small and shower design could be better (a flood of water on the floor is unavoidable), but this is a minor complaint. There is a fire station on the corner, so you will hear it quite often. This didn't bother us as we live on a busy street and are used to the noisy, but if you are easily bothered by noise you might want to bring ear plugs. The elevators are small and slow...another minor complaint I could look past because of the great price and location. Housekeeping staff was friendly and always made sure we had everything we needed. Biggest plus goes to their honest and helpful staff. My fiance had dropped his wallet in the hallway and did not realize it until the morning. In a panic, we searched everywhere and finally decided to let the front desk know in case someone turned it in. As soon as we stepped off the elevator, they recognized him and said they had been trying to get in touch with him all morning. A staff member had found it on the floor and turned it in with everything in tact.

We booked a deluxe queen room at a cost of almost $300 for 1 night and there was nothing deluxe about the room nor was it even a queen size bed! I doubt the room was more than 150 sq ft total! When I questioned the front desk we were basically dismissed and pushed to the side. The front desk person would only repeat my system says it’s a queen. No one ever thought to come check the room (because computers at Tryp are 100% right all the time I guess) Our tv never worked properly and after it was “fixed” it turned on and off by itself. I actually had to unplug the TV! Our shower never got hot water…it would get to a luke warm but never actually hot and the shower leaked all over the bathroom! The A/C struggled all night long to keep the room cool so it was turning on and off every 15 minutes which made it almost impossible to sleep. The cleaning staff filled the elevators all day with cleaning supplies, dirty laundry, garbage and themselves instead of using the very large service elevator. One trip from the lobby to the 12h floor took almost 30 minutes between waiting for the elevator and stopping to either drop off or pick up staff and supplies at every single floor!! It made you think twice about making a trip downstairs because it took so long to get an elevator! But honestly the worst part of the entire stay was the noise! From hearing the garbage pickup at 3am 12 floors below us to the constant slamming doors all night long to walls so thin I could hear simple conversations in the hallway not only on my floor but the floor above and below as well as someone nearby having sex @ 3am!

My intentions were to book the location on 35th St, which had a much higher rating at the time, so I was expecting the worst. With that said, I wasn't so disappointed with my stay at this location.Cons:The room was small, but I hear that's typical of NYC hotels. Aside from the closet, there was no additional storage space, which made the room feel even more cramped for two people. Nightstands with drawers would have been nice. Our remote was broken. We had to hold it together in a very specific way every time we wanted to use it.There's really no shower door, so water got all over the bathroom floor. The water pressure is actually really good, but you can't even enjoy it. Pros:The room was clean.The bed was comfortable and larger than I expected. The room was quiet. We stayed in 326. I heard doors slamming a couple of times, but that was it. There was no outside noise. Housekeeping staff was really nice. They actually called our room to ask if we wanted them to come in. We stayed on Pacific Time, so we slept late most mornings, and they were pretty nice about working around our schedule.The front desk and restaurant staff were nice.The LOCATION is so convenient. I was a little worried about getting around, but the hotel was close to transportation, and a lot of the things we needed were within walking distance, including Duane Reade, restaurants in Hell's Kitchen, Times Square, theaters, and the subway.Overall, the hotel has some flaws, but it worked pretty well for us, mainly because of the location.

The glass shower screen isn't long enough so the bathroom gets soaked (although the water pressure is great). However the bright white image you get online and on the booking wasn't what we ended up with. The walls were brown the ceiling was grey and it was all a bit dark and dreary. WARNING - If you are a light sleeper stay somewhere else! With the fire station next door and the pub on the other side the noise is very loud! Couple that with the constant slamming of doors in the hotel by the house keeping in the morning.

There is a fire station down the street, but good luck finding a spot in the city where you won't hear sirens. The noise did not keep us up at night, as some others had mentioned.

My room also suffered from cooking odors from that same place - breakfast and dinner. As for the interior of the hotel, I find it off-putting that housekeeping left a minimum of 2 bins in the hallway right next to the elevator, crowding the hallway and creating an eyesore. I saw on my side of the elevators three of these bins at one point. The bins are canvas linen bags on a metal frame that are about 2 ft x 2 ft. Some seemed to be used to collect used towels and linens during the housekeeping rounds, and another maybe trash. The perplexing part is why they had to keep at least 1 out all day - to collect guest trash? For such a small space, it's ridiculous. I also requested a late checkout from the night manager because I was kept awake with the music, and I never got a confirmation it was approved.

The bathroom has a sink, toilet, and shower, all in a line from right to left. Fine. I go to NY frequently and am used to small rooms and small bathrooms. But this one was the worst. You can actually sit on the toilet, touch 3 of the walls, and come within about 6-8 inches of touching the 4th wall. Think about this. You can always touch the wall behind you, so that one isn't a negative. You can then reach with your left arm, over the sink, and touch the wall to the left. Yes, the sink and its pedestal is smaller than the length of your arm. You can then reach in front and put your hand square on the wall in front of you. You don't even need to stretch. You reach to the right, through the shower, and you are about 6-8 inches from the 4th wall.Next time you find yourself doing your business, stretch your hand out to the left, in front, and to the right and think of that (+ 6-8 inches on the right side) being the size of your bathroom while on vacation.The only wall you can't touch is on the right where the shower is. The shower is bad too. It's a walk in (fine, I prefer that), with a partial wall separating it from the rest of the bathroom. But the wall isn't even close to long enough to keep the entire bathroom floor being SOAKED. Every time you use the shower, seriously the entire floor gets soaked. There was one good thing about the bathroom. They had special defogging mirrors which worked quite nicely. There's a switch that you flip that will defog the mirror quickly. That was nice.The rest of the room wasn't any better. It had everything you need (bed, table, alarm clock, TV) but nothing you don't. No dresser or drawers, no fridge, no storage. There was a small power strip on the table so that you could charge without hunting for an outlet (that was nice).But otherwise the room looked like a 19 year old guy's apartment. Barren. It had pergo/laminate floors, which my husband hated. I didn't care about the floors but wanted to mention that too.Location was good, and lobby was fine.

We had a minor issue with our staying at the very beginning because our room wasn't ready, we booked a familiar suite and because of the high demand there were no vacancy. Cassandra helped a lot with our room, she got us a room with an extra bed, free breakfast because of the inconvenience and our room ready for the day after.

The lighting in the room was super harsh under the lights but the room was dim and dark (a nightmare for any woman trying to do makeup/hair!).Our room was also right next to the flagpoles on the front of the building.

The location is great if you are looking to go to Times Square/theatre all the time, but in my opinion, once you've been there once there's no need to go ahead. As I had made the hotel aware that this was a special trip I would of expected some sort of apology/deduction in room rate on check out due to the 3 room changes, however the staff were unfriendly and uninterested. As people have mentioned- paying to store your bags seems a bit of a rip off even if it is only $2 per bag!

I asked the desk and they had to get someone to activate the elevator, When we finally got to the room, we found that the room was very small. The toilet was next to the sink with no bars and with no room to get a wheelchair in between. The shower was a walk-in but very small as well. I went back down stairs to let the receptionist (Adelina) know that this was unacceptable. She found another so called accessible room, but when I went in it was even less accommodating then the first one. With my wife wondering what was going on, I went back down to the front desk and let the receptionist know that this was not acceptable. She then told me that they could put us into one of the suites. However, when I went up to look at the suite, it had no wheelchair accommodations. We ended up with nothing. Adelina said that she was sorry, but clearly this hotel is misrepresenting itself when it states they have wheelchair accessible rooms.

All staff were courteous when passing. Rooms were cleaned every day, the corridors and reception area were spotless, elevators were regular. Beds were comfortable, wi fi, safes, iron and board and tea/coffee maker in rooms. Good hot showers with good water pressure. Ice/water/vending machines on three floors.Our room was at the back of the hotel and although not annoying or intrusive there was a distant hum of traffic.

First of all it took 22minutes to check in due to a long line and slow staff. When we got the front of the line the gentleman was very rude and gave the impression he couldn't be bothered. We were first sent to the wrong room on floor 15 so had to go all the way up to 15 to come all the way back down to get the key to our proper room. No apology from the staff for the mistake. The room itself was good. Beds are comfy, shower is powerful and a decent size. There is a big flat screen TV with a good selection of channels.House keeping are very rude and don't know what ""do not disturb"" means. We had the do not disturb sign on the door, yet housekeeping tried to get in the room and when they couldn't they phoned the room twice to ask if we wanted housekeeping! When we told them no as per the reason for do not disturb sign, to get a very rude ""that doesn't mean you don't want housekeeping"" for a reply. Housekeeping are also very noisy in the morning. They shout to each other down the hallways. Keep your wallet to hand as they will try to take your dollars at any opportunity. We asked about a late out and they wanted to charge $100 for this! They also charge you $2/bag for luggage storage! I have never had to pay for such a service!!! The hotel offers an airport shuttle bus but be warned as they charge $30/person for this. If you are not travelling solo, you are cheaper getting a cab! There are also vending machines that are overpriced. Top tip: win the lottery before staying at this hotel.

Initially I came to check in around 2AM and there was no one in the lobby who could check me in. Alphonso finally arrived after about 10 minutes to check me in. I am understanding that he has other responsibilities and some times has to leave the lobby and it's also 2am. Checking in was quite a short and simple process. I hated the wait for the elevator. I noticed they put one elevator out of service during these hours. The lobby was very dark and you can't really take in the gorgeous lobby because almost all the lights are off. Not dim but off. I got up to a really noisy room (304) due to the rooftop bar across the street. I immediately called the front desk asking to change rooms and I was able to. The room I moved to (315) was very quiet the shower was really nice but water gets everywhere because of their being no curtain or door to completely close in the shower. Anyhow right after changing rooms I realized I left my phone in the old room so I called the desk again to let them know the response was ok come to the desk and I'll give you a key so you can get it. The response I would have loved is I'll send security to get the phone and bring it to you so you don't have to come to the desk. I came to the front desk Alphonso gave me a key (that didn't work, I had to revisit the front desk) turns out I ended up going to 305 which was the wrong room. Since he didn't verify the room I moved from and the room was vacant and dirty. This all happened while security was escorting me he didn't even realize this wasn't my room and walked away. I had to go back to the desk yet again security the escorted me back upstairs while he called Alphonso many names to include an idiot. So very unprofessional and inappropriate. Finally I got my phone and went back to my room. Checking out was a much better process of which the young lady was very nice and helpful. PS be sure to check the duvet and sheets when I got to the new room there was a couple strands of hair on the bed but the sheets were clean. I do hope someone contacts me to at the very least hear my concerns. This was the second bad taste in my mouth at a Tryp Hotel. The first one was at Times Square south where the young lady at the front desk was quite rude because I was at the wrong Tryp. She plainly said to me did you read the address I don't understand why you came here without reading it. Who would've thought you would have more than one of the same named hotel with the difference of one word and 15 blocks. More than likely I won't be back but you never know.

We left our bags but weren't given the warmest of welcomes. The shape of things to come!!!Then we (finally) got to the room. What a massive letdown. The best thing I can say is that if you want a really good reason to see as much of Manhattan as you can, stay here. The room is so awful, you'll be happy to stay out as long as you possibly can. We have stayed in some amazing US hotels - this was such a disappointment. Corridors and lifts are dated, dingy and narrow. The room was small, cramped and depressingly dim. The furniture has seen better days, the walls are grey (grey???? In a small room??) and the one window was really small as well. Not a good room for claustrophobes. No fridge, one small bottle of water (just the once - wow) and paper cups for the coffee - no milk, just non-dairy creamer. Yuck!!The bed was comfortable but very little else was positive - dim lighting and no real facilities to speak of. The wardrobe was so small, you had to hang clothes diagonally or you couldn't close the door and the bathroom was pathetically tiny - tired and poky with insufficient space to put your toiletries. In fact, there wasn't sufficient room for anything. A real contrast to everywhere else we have stayed.So, not a relaxing room to stay and the room is really noisy - choose between the noise outside or the din of the air-con. We went for the air-con. The location is great and we had clean towels every day but that's all. You know it's not great when the towels are the best feature of a place.

We are a family of 4 and to find family rooms in New York was not easy and never reasonable when you finally looked at the prices. That said I stumbled across this hotel in the Expedia sale last year and took a punt. I say that because at the time of booking in early 15 the reviews for the hotel were not good...but on booking I took in the fact that it had recently been taken over by the Tryp hotel group who were investing a lot of money modernising the rooms and corridors. It was a gamble that paid off extremely well as the cost was half of that anywhere else and what we got was fantastic and exactly what we needed for 2 adults, 1x 16yr old and 1 X 13 year old. Our room was a family room on the top floor and is the one I think posted on their website with views out towards the fire station below and beyond. Two double beds and a foldaway bunk bed system meant we actually had a spare bed if needed. Storage was ok with a cupboard and room under the bunk bed and if you wanted in the corridor. The room was refurbished and always very clean. Tea/coffee refreshed every day as was bathroom toiletries. Hotel cleaners and staff all very helpful.

I've been once previously but this was my mum's first trip & because we were also going to be celebrating my 30th birthday I wanted to make it as special as possible! I booked the hotel through booking.com for a very reasonable price. It was a bit strange to have 1 nights fee deducted from my card a few weeks before my stay and the remaining amount on arrival at the hotel, I was also informed 14.75% tax is excluded & there would be a $3.50 city tax per night charge. In advance I emailed the hotel to ask whether we could possibly have a late check-out since our flight was not until 21.30, the hotel replied that I could check out at 15.00 but any later than that would incur a 1/2 day charge. On arrival at the hotel at 22.00 we were greeted by a friendly man at the desk, my mum asked whether there was anything he could go with regards to a complimentary upgrade as it was my birthday and he kindly obliged and upgraded us to a family suite on the 11th floor with single bunk beds, divided by a shower room and a queen sized bed. Unfortunately though we did not get any sleep that first night since my mums bed room faced out onto the Main Street which was very noisy with sirens and car horns all night long, my bed faced out onto the air conditioning generators which whirred noisily all night long. We expected noise being in the centre of Times Square but this noise was something else & could be heard even when wearing ear plugs!The following morning we enquired about a room change and were told to come back in the afternoon after checkout to see whether there were any rooms free. We did as instructed and were told we'd need to come back later on in the afternoon as there were no available rooms. We were in our room when the very kind lady at the desk called us at approximately 17:00 to ask whether we still wanted to change rooms, which we did - my mum went down to the desk to swap keys. We were moved to the 16th floor and a penthouse suite!!! How lucky!!! The room was beautiful with a huge double bathroom and patio overlooking Broadway! Sadly there was still very noisy air conditioning units whirring non-stop but we felt we could not complaint again since staff had already been so kind & were able to put up with it, sleeping with ear plugs for the remainder of our stay. The penthouse suite was clean and towels were replaced daily despite us leaving signs up saying we were willing to reuse them, tea and coffee were replaced daily but unfortunately we didn't get any more bottles of water after the first day & it took me until day 4 to realise there was an ice and water machine on lower levels. The beds were always nicely made everyday. The hotel generally was very quiet inside, we only really came across other guests in the lobby and waiting for lifts when going to and from our room. This was brilliant in comparison to the hotel our friends stayed in which was a hype of activity with people coming non-stop and full of kids in school trips! We were so grateful for that!The only downsides were that there were some aspects in the room that were a little run down and need replacing. The lamp switches were wobbly and a little dangerous, the electric blinds over the double patio windows did not work and the lights in the room were generally a little too dim. Apart from that though the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, the walk-in shower was lovely and we had a really nice stay. Unfortunately on checkout they were unable to honour the late checkout of 3pm as I'd previously agreed since we were in one of the prime rooms (penthouse), the latest they could allow was 1pm. We were able to leave our luggage but this was charged at $2 per bag which is quite expensive compared to 50cent per bag at a neighbouring hotel. The concierge kindly arranged a shuttle for us to the airport which was a very smooth journey and easy, stress free way of getting there. Thank you TRYP for a pleasant stay in New York!!

Let's start out with the positives; great location close to Times Square, the rooms are cute and functional, and the engineering staff and concierge were very nice. Now with the negatives;we drove down to New York. We were in a few hours early. We went to the front desk to check in but we were told to come back at 3. We knew that our room wouldn't be ready but the woman at the reception was exceptionally rude..I asked her where we should park the car and she told me she didn't know..I went over to the concierge who gave us directions to a lot nearby... She was a very nice lady....When we came back later afternoon, we were given a room. It was a premium room with queen and bunk beds.... We all liked the room however there was an issue....the closet door was blocked by the bunk beds. There was no where to hang our clothing nor was there access to a safe. we were okay to have the room without the closet, but the safe was an issue. I always lock up the passports and computers. I went down to reception and asked them to bring up a safe. I was told none were available.... Not sure why they couldn't take one from another room and bring it to ours is a big question. There were empty rooms. I was given the option of switching to some other rooms.... I really didn't want to but had no choice. I looked at a few and chose the same room a few floors down....we had to pack up all the things again and move them down. The room seemed okay however the bathroom has a motion sensored fan which goes on the moment someone walks in....it is not a quiet fan but it does go on and on and on.... Literally it is on for a full 8-10 minutes after the bathroom is not being used and it sounds like a plane is taking off.... My daughter decided to take a shower. The handle fell off the moment she tried to turn the water on. The heating system is very noisy....my husband tried to turn it off but could not.....this hotel is poorly managed....they should really try to make their guests happy but it seems like they don't care....

What was meant to be a nice getaway, turned into a stressful and unresolved stay. My husband usually leaves his phone in the hotel room as our sim don't usually work in the US, I on the other hand carry my phone to take pictures of course. One particular morning he left his phone on the bed as the battery has just died and we went out for the day. When we returned late in the afternoon, we notice immediately the phone missing. We left the room with the beds unmade and when we returned the bed was made so the only person who was in the room is the housekeeper. We immediately called the manager to let him know of the issue. He came up to our room to get the information. We emptied all the suitcases, pulled the sheets off the beds and even lifted the beds to see if it fell beneath while the housekeeper was making up the bed. It was no where in the room. We were absolutely certain that the housekeeper took the phone. The manager said his staff didn't steal and that he had asked if she saw it and of course she said she didn't see a phone. He claimed that he even contacted the laundry services as the housekeeper mentioned to him she changed the sheets. Mind you, we were only there for four nights and that was only our second night, I've stayed at a lot of hotels and they don't change your sheets after one two nights unless they were dirty, which they weren't. The next day we told the front desk that we didn't want anyone in our room while we weren't there. When we were exiting out room, the housekeeper, who I'm sure was the same as the day before, was a few rooms away at her caddy. When she saw us coming out of our room that morning, she vanished, as if not to see us. My husband made a police report to the NYPD who is investigating the matter. My stay came to an end and still no phone or reasonable answer from the management about reimbursement for the phone. It was a brand new Samsung s6+ edge. All we were told is that their insurance company will contact us. Three weeks has already past since my stay and no one has contacted us.It is ridiculous for management to protect staff of they are being untrustworthy, I am a customer, for what reason would I be making up a story about a phone being stolen whilst we're on vacation trying to enjoy ourselves.I will NEVER stay there again and I don't recommend anyone to.

It started out with an early check in, I wasn't sure if they would be able to accommodate our request because we were in early and requested a room without a view based on other reviewers. Luckily, they were able to do both and the room was lovely. Some of the furniture was a bit scratched and dented but nothing serious. Our heater was blowing cold air when we arrived and we reported tot he front desk on our way to lunch and it was fixed when we returned to the room. Housekeeping was prompt everyday and all of the employees we encountered were friendly.As far as the reviewers who complained about the size of the room, they must not have ever been to NYC before. I have been in smaller rooms, although the bathroom was one of the smallest I've been in. I also don't like these half-shower partitions that seem to be all the rage in design, they're not practical and flood the bathroom. I also would have liked to have seen keycard entry required for the elevator.

Genuinly cannot fault the location (infact it's great) and the hotel itself is in fairly good shape with clean and comfortable rooms, again cannot fault that either...The problem we found was in fact the hospitality (or lack of it). From the minute we arrived the service left me and my partner feeling a little deflated. The man on reception on our arrival was pretty rude from the get-go. He then said that our hotel had not been settled up by the company we booked with and that I would have to pay $200 dollars for him to be able to check me in. When I questioned this (As I had indeed paid for the hotel) he folded his arms and said 'well I cannot check you in then, sorry' He then went on to say I can call reservations in the morning and claim this back. I wasn't exactly thrilled with this but agreed as it would work out easier than having to go and find another hotel. During the whole check in experience he didn't show any qualities which I would expect from his job role. No welcome, No smile, No conversation, No interest. To be perfectly honest his customer service was terrible. Really very poor. He also asked me if I realised I had booked a double bed when he saw we were two girls. Yes thankyou, I did realise this. Throughout our stay we had a couple different pre-auths come off our card, which left us a little confused. I went down to reception on three occasions as the pre auths all came out on different days and were for really random amounts. I fully understand how pre-auths work as a hospitality manager myself, so that wasn't the issue, the issue was the lack of explanation and holding amounts which I hadn't authorised. Not acceptable actually.When I go to hotels part of the experience is the relationships you build with the staff, that just didn't happen here. Actually there was a lady sat on the desk by the glass lift (Blond hair and what sounded like a eastern European accent), she was helpful in dealing with our shuttle and had a good level of customer care, so thank you.All in all, if you want a well priced hotel in a good spot but are not bothered about the hospitality and customer service you receive, then it might be the hotel for you. If your like me and you like service with A smile, don't go here, find somewhere else!

Needed a last minute reservation and Hotel.com had a great price for this place. Being a Ny'er, I would not choose this loca however, for a family of 5 TRYP offered the best case scenario. Adorable little lobby with a nice little bar, modern and clean. I can see from other reviews how check-in can be maddening, but we lucked out and were helped right away (checked in at 5pm) and was therefore painless. Now on to the room...We entered the room, and as much as I was pleased with the layout/space- there was food all over the floor and garbage, and marker writing on the bathroom mirror. Bad sign yes, but the guy who checked us in - came right back in with the vacuum and started cleaning! That just confirms they are under-staffed. So Kudos def. go out to Jason for rectifying the situation however, extremely unpleasant first impression. The room ""Samsung room-#107' had 2 flat screens, bunk bed, sofabed, king bed in the master area and a well stocked/modern bathroom. Design was all very IKEA like. There were 2 huge windows that faced 'WOOD' , ok by us- didn't need the NYC view however, this would be a bummer to any non-Ny'er I can imagine. For our needs (roomy place to sleep)- totally fit the bill. The kids had fun when in the room and location ended up working out well for us - close to the subways we needed, etc.. Only choose this hotel if your priority is space over quality/NY experience. BTW - it's right by Penn Station, so calling it 'Times Square South' is pretty comical.

The location was great, especially for our first trip to NYC. The room was OK. Small, but from research that is to be expected. We were on the third floor and our window opened onto a garbage-filled rooftop. The sheets weren't changed in the entire 7 days we were there. And we came back one day to find a q-tip on our floor, which did not arrive with us as we don't use q-tips. So that was gross. The bathroom would literally flood every time we showered.I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, and I would also recommend people look at accommodations outside of Times Square.

Had I known that, I would've found a cheaper parking garage and not bothered with the valet. Onto the room. It was tiny and it was visibly quite dirty.

It was close to the fire station though, so anyone who isn't familiar with the sound of the siren should be aware. The room itself was fine and quite spacious considering the location. I didn't notice any problem with the cleanliness or the conditions of the room. However, the hallway looked like it needed some upgrade or more lighting. The lobby looks clean and bright, which certainly helps. In term of service, our room was knocked not once but twice, to ask us what time we are checking out (both times were around 9-10am, which is way earlier than the check out time at noon). I mean, there should be a better way than that to check if we have checked out yet.

I was told it was a mistake so they took some of it off and now I only owed $21.00 more per night for unit taxes and such. This went on for a while. next I only owed $7.00 more dollars.

This would set the tone of the detached, vaguely disingenuous but not wholly unpleasant service I would encounter at Tryp Times Sq. Nobody was truly rude, nor did it seem like anyone really gave a crap about me either.Room was clean, with a fair amount of wear and tear to the newish appointments; same went for the mattress which was in need of an update. Stiff, striped pillowcases on pillows that seemed more suitable for a daybed or sofa. Oddly placed AC unit in room's (#1319) only window meant a bunker effect with no view and limited sunlight through the upper aperture only if one chose to raise curtain all the way. Acrylic faux wood floor with no carpeting. Decent (for me) lighting with dimmer and no desk. Dorm style cube fridge in room.

Decent enough towels, excellent mirror, half glassed-in ""Euro"" style shower with no door. Generic but decent Gilchrist & Soames soaps/amenities.At the end of the day, it reminded me of a cheap version of the Distrikt over on 40th St, or an upgraded version of Pod 51.

We were in the heart of the theater district so excellent location for shows. The second time we stayed there later in the month, we asked them to match the same rate and they did. And then they upgraded us to another family suite and it was just as amazing. Most of all, the hotel and its staff rocked their jobs.

Breakfast was around $17 and had a pretty good selection. Location was great, we were in walking distance to a lot of key tourist sites.

The hotel is a bit tiny but met our needs. We were checked in quickly and went up to our rooms. The bathroom was newly redone and looked very nice. One thing we encountered after using it was that the water would get everywhere since the glass shield was not long enough to keep the water inside of the shower. It looks pretty but what a nightmare that must be to clean every morning for the maid staff. The king bed was very comfy. I loved the full-length mirror inside of the closet. We got this hotel for $99 the Friday night weekend before Christmas, which was unbelievable. I would definitely stay here again if the price was right. The only complaint is that we could hear people leaving their rooms as early as 6:30 in the morning and their doors slamming. And not just once, at least a dozen times. Just a side note, check out Patzeria Family Restaurant which is within walking distance. Great Italian and pizza family-owned business!","Buffalo, NY",21,4.0

Really last minute as in it was booked December 26. Snagged a sale through Priceline they were having for $215/night. Are you kidding me? There has got to be a catch. Booked for 2 nights 12/31-1/2 so for 2 nights the total was $501. But I should also note that my room was covered through my credit card company so all I had to actually pay out of pocket was $3.80 for hotel fees. OK so NYE is finally here. We hit the road at about 7:30am from Baltimore and arrived in NY around 11. I was told by hotel staff that the parking garage that they validate for is Quik Parking on 50th street between 8th and 9th. It's actually attached to a theatre but the name of the theatre escapes me. The hotel fee at the garage is $45/day (exactly 24 hours) If you go beyond that 24th hour you will be charged another $45 for another daily rate.. With that being said, if you don't plan to move your car at exactly the 24th hour, it'll be cheaper to use the garage regular hourly rate. Ex. after checkout we decided to get breakfast which was around 11:00, by the time I went to get the car out of the garage which was 1 hour beyond my 48th hour I was being charged another $45 for the day. Total for parking with the hotel discount was $135, however the gentleman at the garage told me that he would charge me the garage rate which made the total $122.Anyway, back to the hotel. Thankfully upon arrival around 11:00 we were allowed to check in which was a smooth process and not made to wait until 3. Waited in line about 10 min and then off to my room 322 (facing the street). Because of other reviews I was a little skeptical about being in a room on a low floor and facing the street due to noise. But I'm a city girl and I felt like, what's the worse that can happen. Obviously there was noise but not enough to keep us from sleeping. Yes I heard sirens and horns in the distance but even being directly across the street from a roof top bar I didn't even hear any NYE/partying noise from that. The only noise we heard which really grated on my nerves was from the flag pole banging in the wind. The banging of poles in the middle of the night is very annoying. Again, not annoying enough to piss me off in NY on NYE. Cute little quaint but modern room. I loved the wallpaper which is actually a map of NY. The beds and pillows were not too soft and not too firm but a very in between comfortable and the linens were of good quality. The room was small like other reviews stated but how much time are you spending in the room anyway. It was 2 of us and it was just enough room. I also read complaining reviews of no outlets to plug in electronic devices. Not true. There was an iHome on the right side of the bed where you can plug your iPhone into that or plug another device into the USB outlet on the iHome . On the left side of the bed there's 2 USB outlets. You also have a small closet with hangers, iron and ironing board. Coffee maker was a plus for me as well. The only thing that I would actually have to complain about is the size of the bathroom. It was literally a matchbox. No sink space for anything except about 3 of those 3oz liquid bottles that you have to carry on airplanes. I'm only 5'2 and while sitting on the toilet (which sits really low) my knees were about 2 inches away from the wall. Not sure how anybody taller or heavier than me can use this toilet without being crunched against the wall or falling into the shower. If you are tall, heavy or have any kind of disability you may want to request a larger room. I believe my room was the cheapest/standard room. My other complaint would be the shower. The water pressure was high and the water gets very very hot but please install a shower curtain or door. Other reviews stated that their floor got soak and wet due to the lack of a shower curtain. I have to admit that we just put a towel on floor and honestly the towel was barely wet. Problem solved. For me it's still kind of awkward taking a shower with nothing there though.Check out was easy breezy, just gave them my name and checkout was done. We decided to eat breakfast after checkout so we just dropped our bags off with the bellman. NOTE: Theres a $2/item fee for bags to be held. Now this is what I have a problem with or maybe I'm just spoiled by this service being free minus tip in other tourist places such as Vegas or LA. Would I stay here again? Yes, April 2016","Baltimore, Maryland",48,4.0

Summary:Bad roomBad ACBad customer serviceBad bathroom (not hygiene wise) Good spaceAverage priceWe arrived at the hotel earlier than the check-in time and were told that we could leave our bags and come back later so we did. We returned later at night and were checked into a room on the 12th floor that was right across the elevator. I thought this was going to be a noise issue, but it wasn’t. We walked into the room (double beds room) and I was surprised to find the rooms were pretty spacious. The bathroom is small and the toilet is very close to the shower but this wasn’t a problem; what might be a problem to other people is the fact that the water from the shower spills out because there’s only half of a glass screen. I guess the solution is to face the shower head towards the wall. **HOWEVER, although the rooms were spacious, it doesn’t make up for the fact that 1) the air conditioning was leaking, 2) there were shorts left on the floor of the bathroom, 3) the TV wasn’t working, and 4) Costumer service was terrible. We called downstairs and they said they’d send someone right away. Thirty-five minutes and a couple of phone calls later we finally got a repairman who said the air was frozen. He “defrosted” it and said we should turn it back on in thirty minutes. There’s no thermostat, by the way, just a knob on the air with handwritten instructions and, of course, the knob was way off. Either which way we waited thirty minutes, turned it back on, and prayed that it would work. The next day we went out into the city and came back at night. It was well beyond 12 am which is typical in New York City. We didn’t ask to have the room made because we didn’t want to risk it. The pillowcases didn’t smell very clean and we were fortunate enough, I feel, to have clean sheets the first time around; if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. However, it was three of us in the room and we did need some extra towels. Well, readers, the response we got was, “We don’t do that past 12.” I’m almost one hundred percent sure that other hotels will provide towels if you ask. Right then and there another hotel guest starts inquiring about whether they can get help for a lady that was feeling ill in the lobby and she was told, “Well…if she’s not a hotel guest…” and the guy shrugged. The audacity. Icing on the cake? THE AIR WAS STILL BROKEN. I left the next morning thinking about how I never want to stay there again. It was a matter of providing some service and being kind enough to care. I hope the hotel can read this and improve. Considering the price, which wasn’t terrible for this time of year, they could’ve given a bit more.","Miami, Florida",0,1.0

The great? The location! Literally a block from any direction, hells kitchen to the left, times square to the right, theater district across the block and a subway at pretty much every corner. The ""OTHER"" nice? THE SERVICE! NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL! Exceptionally friendly and helpful front desk staff, a concierge that knows the area inside and out and the rest of the staff eager to please! The property? The front check in area is very lovely, a bit understated for a manhatton hotel but lovely just the same. The lobby is used frequently by guests and with the wonderful bar in the lobby apparantly the locals as well. Always a warm feeling though. Thats the good of it. The bad of the property. While needs a second chance from me personally as the property was under a floor by floor renovation our floor was supposably done. Overall the hotel decor and the rooms were modernly furnished. Small overall and while thats typical of nyc they are on the tight side by comparison. Even the finished areas left me with a feeling that its all a bit unfinished. Our room was adequate however there was a light above the door that wasnt attached and the naked hanging wires both gave a feeling of concern for fire and safety and NEVER was repaired. I capitalize NEVER because I brought it to the attention of the front desk, we were there for several nights and unfortunately had a room with poor flushing abilities and had to call for maintenance on 4 seperate occassions to have it unstopped thus having the maintenance ppl who were super friendly walk under it in and out every time. Other then those two particulars the cleaning staff was great, the room was accomodating and we were comfortable. Everyday a look outside the front door, regardless of morning, afternoon or night left a view of the cleaning personells carts that had to be dodged while heading to the elevators. Add to that the view of the staircase outside the window that had the same gstring tied to the handrail for our entire stay left an ""unmanhatton"" feel like some other hotels do. The other downside for this property is the payforbreakfast. One would think at least a continental with the price especially with the waisted room in the back of the lobby and despite the hotel being connected to the eatery. The property seems to be trying so I honestly hope it keeps it up and would recommend it!","Conover, North Carolina",81,3.0

The point of the trip was to spend time together. I had booked one room with two double beds. We checked in our bags at one, were told that room would not be ready till 3 (no problem!) We came back at around 5 to check in & were told that our room was no longer available with no explanation as to why. We were then given 2 seperate rooms & were told that they were next to each other (not ajoining) & the rest of the hotel was sold out. The front desk associate then had her manager come speak to us. At this point we were told that there was a pipe leakage 2 hours ago in our room & it was unavailable to us. No one had contacted us in this 2 hour period to let us know of the problem. We agian were told that the hotel was sold out. By this point we were exhausted & given the busy time of year unable to get a room anywhere else. With no other choice we took the two rooms. The rooms were not next to each other but down the hallway. The small double bed left half of my leg hanging off of it, not big enough for one person let alone 2 to share. The smoke detector was covered with a plastic bag & had wires unattached. One piece of our luggage was missing a wheel. We then receive a phone call that the manager can put us in 2 rooms with queen size beds that are next to each other, one room is unavailable for the time being. So at this point we have waited 3 hours for both rooms to be set up; wasting valuable time, creating stress, and preventing us from the family time we hoped for. We then go to take a shower to find that the shower does not close, water poured everywhere and made a huge mess. We used towels to clean it up. These towels & even the toilet paper was not replaced before our check out time at 5 the next day. Bed was not made, room not cleaned, etc. and if it couldn't get any better, our breakfast the next morning was served in the lobby where there was no where to sit except at the bar right in front of the door which was freezing from people coming in and out. When going to leave we asked the concierge for help getting a taxi (apparently 5 is change of shift and most people would not stop or told us no to grand central) & were told to do it ourselves. Safe to say we will not be returning & were very disappointed. ","Wallingford, Connecticut",2,1.0

We arrived around 3:30 pm on a Thursday and had a very fast check-in, as our room was available right away. We reserved a small room with two twin beds, which was just enough for us for two nights! The bathroom was quite small, but again, we were out and about most of the time and only needed the room to sleep at night and rest in between activities in the city.We did have one incident with the shower when we tried to use it for the first time, we were unable to get hot water. Fortunately, the front desk sent maintenance right away and the issue was fixed within 15 minutes! The shower in our room only had a half door, which caused a lot of water to get on the ground while showering, but we made this work for our stay.We were headed to Battery Park to catch the ferry to Liberty Island on Friday, so we asked the front desk for directions to the subway to Battery Park. The man seemed confident in his directions, but he unfortunately sent us the completely wrong way and we almost missed our ferry. Luckily, we were able to ask for help at the subway station and made it just in time.The housekeeping staff was friendly and kept our room neat for the two days we were there, and we also used the bell staff to have our bags checked while we spent our last day in the city before departing home. It was a little bit unfortunate that we had to pay $2 per bag to have our things stored for the day, but we understood as there was very limited space in the storage room and many guests needed the service!The TRYP on 48th was a great location in Times Square off of Broadway ave and we found it to be decently quiet in terms of other guests around us and very clean!

First of all, the room was extremely noisy and the windows kept no noise out. I woke up many times every night, even though I had ear plugs in and I’m generally not sensitive to a bit of noise. If you book a room, you MUST demand a room that is not facing the street side. It was also very noisy inside - every night there were noisy hotel guests past midnight, probably because the hotel is so close to Times Square. The room itself failed to cover many of the basics: no bedside table on 1 side; no electricity outlets close to bed; no wall/curtain/door around shower so that the room was soaked after a quick shower of only a few minutes; no microwave and no fridge; heating/cooling system did not work leaving us sweaty all night (in early December!) and forcing us to open up the windows, making the noise issue even worse; no glasses for water but only plastic coffee cups, and no tea bags; old and scratched furniture (although personally I don’t care about that). The service was terrible as well. In the manual available in the rooms it says that stamps are available downstairs, but when you ask, they send you to a deli a block away. There was no room service (or at least I couldn’t find it). I had to go downstairs to ask a few questions about extending my staff, and staff was markedly less friendly compared to hotels down the street. Once, I came down around 9pm and had to wait 10 minutes before anyone showed up. When he did, he told me, “Please wait”, and left me standing for another 5 minutes, completely ignoring me. Finally, Wyndham refused to give me any hotel points because I was not part of their Non-Qualifying Market Segments, even though I don’t fall in any of these market segments when you consider them one by one. At NONE of the above points did anyone of the hotel do anything to make the experience better, even though there were plenty of opportunities. They don’t seem to care about your experience AT ALL.

We use the Hotels Tonight app to find good, last-minute deals. Needless to say, we've stayed at A LOT of mid-tier hotels, with a wide quality range. The TRYP is one of the better hotels in this class. Conveniently located if you have business in Midtown or Times Square, the hotel offers a modern design with clean and comfortable beds, small, updated bathrooms with tile floors and glass shower doors. The floors are faux wood tile throughout the room, which I prefer over carpet. The lighting is reasonably good, with LED bulbs rather than those hideous CFL's they use in many places. The hallways and elevators are a bit worn and tired, but that's pretty standard for this level of hotel. Overall, this hotel gets my approval. We'll be staying here again.",NYC,2,4.0

They had excellent access for plugs etc including a USB charger plug which I liked. It's not an amazing hotel and it's not a bad hotel. A lot of the things we weren't keen on could be easily fixed. For example the room layout seemed wrong in our room (1003) the bed seemed the wrong way and gave the impression the room was smaller than it was. No full length mirror (except inside a wardrobe in the corner of a small room) wasn't great. The bed was very soft but that's just our preference. There was a bug (not sure what it was) trying to get out of the overflow in the sink on the last day which wasn't great. The hotel also gave me 2 receipts for my stay which worried me about being charged twice, it seems I've only been charged once but will keep an eye on my statement. One wall was weirdly always hot. I couldn't quite work out why but it probably explained why we needed the aircon as it was very hot to touch. It looked like it had been heavily insulated through a window outside but it was hard to tell. The door seemed to rattle as well which was weird. Even when locked it rattled if people walked down the corridor. It was a reasonable hotel for the price given what it costs to stay around Times Square and maybe some of our complaints you wouldn't experience. All in all. Not bad.

The TRYP by Wyndham Times Square is a typical New York hotel. A smaller room BUT a very comfortable bed, I believe the hotel underwent a renovation when it changed to the TRYP brand. The location is outstanding, only a half-block to Times Square, The hotel was always clean, and well-staffed. Now the negatives- our room was seventh floor, street side which resulted in a lot of street noise, noted in other reviews here.The elevators (2) are small, to the point of being claustrophobic, also previously noted.The bathroom has a motion sensor controlled fan. Apparently, should you take a long shower, the sensor will not note your presence through the fogged stall glass, and shuts off, resulting in more fogginess. Interesting way to encourage water conservation, TRYP by Wyndham!Finally, the bathroom lighting is very deficient, consisting of one overhead light and two smal lights inset into the mirror. I found myself attempting to shave while standing in a shadow.This location is a usable hotel, typical NYC, small and overpriced, good tourism location.

I received a couple of emails stating that there could be a possibility however this could be looked at on arrival to the hotel. Unfortunately on booking in we were given a very small room, the air conditioning unit was full of dust, along with cupboards in the room, the wall paper ripped and wooden doors edges need painting. albeit the bed exceptionally comfortable, room adequate for our needs. Staff appeared friendly and helpful and after stating about the issues with the dust on the air conditioning unit we were give a complimentary drink In the bar. We were extremely upset that the hotel couldn't do more to accommodate our request due to it being such a special visit to us, but I must say the location, bed and the vibe of the hotel very good. Also I was asked to email the concierge about tickets to the Statue of Liberty crown tours, but unfortunately the email I received was very unhelpful and offered me nowhere to go with trying to obtain tickets. On checked out on our last day the staff did not ask how our stay was or if there was anything else they could do, so we never raised these issues with the hotel at the time. We wanted to send you the hotel a message direct rather than going onto tripadvisor with our views on our stay however after constant emails i have received nothing. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay, however this was a very special time for us with the engagement but have been really let down with this.

Staying at the TRYP hotel off W. 48th was a find. We really loved the proximity to all of the attractions, the subway, the restaurants, and the bright lights of Broadway. We enjoyed the modern, sleek look of the hotel lobby and the rooms and were even a little fascinated by the ultra-modern half-shower.  Unfortunately, the first room we were given left a lot to be desired. The TV in our room was partially inoperable. Local channels on TV were filled with static, unclear, and froze repeatedly. The engineer was called in to check the TV twice (once the night we arrived and again on Thursday night). Both times he said there was nothing to be done and said he’d contact the Cable company. The issue was never resolved. In addition, the beds were thin and somewhat uncomfortable. We could feel the springs in the beds when we sat up or entered / exited the bed. After talking with the front desk, we were offered a new room with a working TV. The first rooms that we were offered were smaller and did not have the amenities that were part of the standard room package and that my mother needed for her comfort. I am thankful for front desk associate, Kumar. He was not only attentive to our needs, but he was professional and sought to find a solution for us. He worked to find us a room that was configured with the same layout and amenities that were in our previous room. He arranged for our luggage to be moved, provided us an extended checkout that fit our schedule better, and even offered us drink coupons at their in-house bar. The room we were moved to more than met our needs. The beds were better, thicker, and more comfortable. The television was operational in all the ways that were expected and should be standard. This room even had some other “standard” amenities as an alarm clock. To be quite honest, if the room we were moved to was the room where we started, I can honestly say that our experience would have been great from start to finish. All in all, we had a great experience during our trip to New York and a good stay at TRYP. We would stay here again and I would even recommend the hotel to friends and family. The location can’t be beat and the modern, international flair made for a great environment. Thanks again to Kumar for his attentiveness and professionalism.

Check in was easy. We were able to check-in upon arrival at 12 noon, which was nice. We tried to upgrade to a room with two beds, but they were booked so we were stuck with one. When we got to the room we discovered it was VERY small (even for New York). We didn't plan on being in the room much so the size wasn't an issue. The bathroom was also tiny, but it was nice enough. The one thing it was missing was a towel rack. There wasn't really a place to hang a hand towel, so it felt like we were always moving stuff out of the way. There were plenty of towels and some okay soaps and lotions. Most importantly, the room and bathroom were clean. There were a few issues with the room that would make me not go back. The first and most annoying was the water temperature. On the first morning, we were up around 8:30 and neither of us got a hot shower. The second morning we were up at 6:00 and we did get hot showers, but on days when I'm not leaving early, I wouldn't be up that early and enjoy a hot shower. Second, the beds were comfortable, but they were sort of like memory foam, which I don't really like. Third, they don't fully replenish the room when they clean. We drank the coffee and it was not replenished for the next morning. We also had extra towels and those weren't replenished either. Last, there aren't any curtains. They only have pull down blinds. We were on a room that faced in so the building blocked most of the light, but if you had a street view, light might be an issue if you prefer a dark room. The hotel itself is nice, very trendy NYC.

I asked the check in clerk about the rooms (are the connected? why two rooms? I have two kids with me, I asked for one room) They told me no, not connected, two rooms because they were overbooked, rooms were close together so it shouldn't be a problem (not close together at all) against my better judgement I went to room 300 and 301, the rooms were not close to each other and were small. barely fit the double bed in there. Our view was of a blue tarp covering trash. there were housekeeping carts in the middle of the hallway the entire stay. I went a few hours later, and asked for a room with two beds (I talked it over with my daughters and they were not comfortable being by themselves) They told me they did not have a double room. They were over booked. so they sent me all over the hotel to look at two rooms with one bed each in them to find what would satisfy me (at one point they gave me a key to a room that was occupied). I settled on two rooms that were a little closer together, reluctantly. I really had no choice considering it was the holiday weekend. I immediately started calling other area hotels. looking for something that i could move to. eventually the manager talked to me and told me they had some cancellations so I was able to get a different room with two beds. ended up being the 'penthouse' on the 16th floor. bigger room, great view. Crappy room. floors were uneven and the fake wood floors were coming up off of the floor, the beds were uncomfortable, the lighting was horrible, it smelled, water pressure was low. Walls were very thin, there were many times that my young daughter would ask me 'whats that noise? when the neighbors were 'noisy', all around bad stay. I will say that the staff was friendly and seemed to really care about the concerns, almost like they know the problems the hotel has. The manager was very accommodating once we finally spoke. Hotel is aweful, staff was great. I did not eat at the hotel. I basically left at 6 in the morning and did not return until after midnight each day. I could not wait to get checked out.

After all, it was my husband's big birthday. So let me list the pros and cons of this hotel. Pros: near Time SquarePros: friendly front desk. You can check out up to 1pmPros: lots of outlets to charge any technology you have. The cons:The rooms redefined petite. I am 5'2 and I felt like Gulliver. When I stood up, the bed lamps were on the level of my chin. The room was Very dark. The TV was freezing up every half hour. The old fashioned air conditioner was right next to the bed, I was freezing every night. If i turned it off, the room became stuffy. The queen size bed: I'm not sure if it was European ""queen"" size, it wasn't US queen size bed. I'm short, so I was lucky. My husband, who is 5""11, not so much. The bed was short. The bathroom was tiny. If I stood right under the shower, I was fine if I didn't turn, and I'm not a large women. The glass covered half of the shower stall, so by he time I was done with the shower, the floor was full of water. There was no space to put anything like toiletry. The sink was tiny. I managed to put two toothbrushes and a travel size toothpaste, and a travel size hairspray on top of it. The towels felt like hey came from a dollar store. New York is ridiculously expensive. I thought by getting a corporate rate, I would get a good hotel. Don't get me wrong, the front desk and the bell boy desks were great. Very friendly and professional people. If you are traveling on business, and there is only one short person in the room, the hotel is fine. Otherwise, for leisure..... I don't think so. ","Stamford, Connecticut",28,3.0

The corridors are constantly full of laundry trolleys and the carpets full of stains, which doesn't create a good first impression. Our original room was tiny more suited for one person. You could hardly walk around the bed and you had to manoeuvre behind the bathroom door to get in. It was dark and we had 3 broken lights. Not helped by the view of a wall outside. We complained to reception and the staff were quite dismissive and hardly even looked up from the computer screen to acknowledge us. Eventually they sent someone to replace the lights which was great. Our first night we had no sleep due to the hotel being near a fire station (which obviously can't be helped) then when using the iron in the morning the iron leaked a load of hot water all over my clothes and ironing board. So down to reception we went; again. This time we asked to be moved and we were put on a higher floor. This room was bigger and much nicer. However on our third night in this room we dropped the TV remote control down the bed. When retrieving the battery that fell out we discovered a Big Mac box with black lettuce in it, an old dirty sock, sweet wrappers and an empty plastic bottle it knocked me sick to think we had been sleeping above rotten food and dirty laundry. We again went to reception to complain with the offending Big Mac box. We were given 2 complementary drinks at the bar and was told someone would clean under the bed. When we returned, the empty bottle and sock were gone but the wrappers and bottle lid were still there. Why it wasn't cleaned properly, I don't know. It wouldn't have taken much to brush out under the bed. At this point; we realised there was no point in complaining again and were sick of queuing up to speak to someone. We couldn't even claim our drinks because the bar was closed and the staff said we had to use it at the bar rather than exchange it for something else in return. Considering we'd already had to move rooms you'd think the hotel would want us to have a better experience but I guess they didn't care. I've stayed in a number of hotels in New York and this has been the worst experience in a hotel so far.

The elevators are extremely small and could be problematic if you're claustrophobic and have more than 2 people and luggage. The rooms are small, the bathroom extremely small, full length mirror located inside the closet door. But the most annoying issue by far is the EXTREMELY slow draining bathroom sink that you have to wait 10 minutes to drain before you can run water again. Called the front desk to ask that someone come tend to it. Phone rang 12 times before someone answered, after waiting 15 minutes, no one showed so called and canceled as the wait was making us late for our appointment. Apparently we weren't the only ones with plumbing issues, because the next day the maintenance man walked past us as we were leaving out with a plunger in his hand on his way to another room on our floor. And apparently every night around midnight for the 3 nights we stayed, the handles on the same set of doors was being repaired and had blue painters tape wrapped around them each evening. Walls were thin and could hear the neighbor's alarm go off in the morning and continued to go off for at least 15 minutes.

However, one night we heard some drunken hotel guests making noise going to their rooms, but that is not the hotel's fault. Just inconsiderate people.I did have an issue with the concierge. The hotel offered a ""airport shuttle"" which for two people with two bags was $65.00. As we had spent the same amount for a private cab from JFK to the hotel I figured, ok we will take the shuttle back to save having to get a cab to the hotel. However, the concierge failed to advise us that the shuttle stopped at literally five other hotels after ours to pick up people until the van was full. We spend a full 30 minutes picking up other passengers before we even started towards the airport. This made us rushed for our plane, even though the concierge assured us that taking the shuttle at the particular time we did would be fine.

Also, on arrival there was a small bottle of water in the room but once finished it was not replaced, during the whole 8 days we stayed we were not given any more!

Space is small and realistically about 1/2 the size as most any other standard hotel room anywhere else. With that being said; this hotel was not only a steal in cost; but a simple & updated luxury in its very least. The lobby swank, the staff incredibly friendly, and the rooms, although small; a ""place to sleep"". The standard rooms are great for 1 to 2 people MAX. And remember, these beds are Full Size; so if you are 6'1 or taller; upgrade your room choice. Everything is updated & the location is dead central Times Square/Theatre District. My only reasoning for giving this 4 and not 5 stars is simply due to the softness and comfortability of the Bed/Pillows. Very soft! Not good for bad backs/necks. And, you absolutely do sink way down into the bed/pillows. So. With all of this knowledge now; please book this hotel & enjoy the area (not the room).

The hotel has just undergone a refurbishment and it looks very good. The staff were great and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. If anyone from the hotel reads this review, can they let me know where you can buy one of these mattresses? We had looked at the reviews of the hotel and realised that it was in a busy part of Manhattan - right in the heart of the theatre district and round the corner from the small fire station on 8th Avenue. We requested and were given two rooms on a high floor. In the end we heard the fire engine briefly a couple of times and it did not disturb our sleep, and the traffic was barely audible from the 13th floor.

Don't know how that happened as we never looked at this hotel at all. How and ever we decided to make the most of it. The air conditioning unit was so loud that there is no way that you could sleep with it on. I don't know how anyone who was there in Summer would have been able to put up with it. We slept with just a sheet over us and just didn't even put it on but even having it plugged in was very noisy. If you had a shower the heat in the room became unbearable. With a fire station right beside us it was really very noisy. The only positive thing I have to say about this hotel that it is smack bang in the middle of Times Square and perfect location!. We put up with it as we really only showered and slept in the place but were really disappointed with it. Staff didn't welcome us to the hotel on check in and just took the key from us when we left and that was it. Rather abysmal public relations if you ask me. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone as there are so many more to choose from and as I say we thought we were going to the other Tryp Hotel in the first place.

You can't beat the location in the heart of the theater district with abundant dining and shopping options within easy walking distance. An easy walk from the Port Authority if you take the bus from the airport; Penn Station is also walkable if you arrive via Long Island Railroad or Amtrak. Front desk staff were very nice and I appreciated having my folio under my door to expedite checkout. I stayed on the 8th floor facing 48th St. and had no street noise.My room in the ""deluxe queen"" category was perfect for a solo traveler -- on the small side but has everything you need, including iron/ironing board, luggage racks, coffee maker, hairdryer and safe. Bed and bath linens were very nice quality. Suggest you bring flop flops or slippers because the room has wood floors instead of carpeting (which I actually prefer for cleanliness). Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is size of bathroom. It was fine for me alone, but would be quite tight for two occupants as there's room for only one person at the small sink. That said, it has Grohe fixtures and excellent hot water and water pressure. Shower is small and water splashes on the floor as the glass partition has an opening but no door. Toiletries are basic - soap, shampoo, conditioner. Bring your own lotion or pick it up at one of the drugstores in the neighborhood.Bottom line is that this is an excellent value in a top location. I highly recommend as long as you are okay with the small bathroom. I have stayed at many deluxe hotels but who needs to pay $500+ if you are in NYC on your own nickel instead of an expense account? The Tryp offers a great value proposition!","Los Angeles, California",0,4.0

Our rate was around $200.00 a night which, when compared to other options in the area, was a good rate. The hotel is in a great location- it is convenient to multiple subway lines and right near Time Square and multiple theaters so it is a good base for exploring that area of the city and taking in shows. There are also a lot of restaurant options in the area, some which are reasonably priced by non NYC standards, and there is a duane read and a market right near the hotel.Our room was small, but clean. The bathroom is also small, but again clean and everything worked. There was an issue with our heater making noise, seeming always at 6:30 in the AM- maintenance did try to correct it but were unsuccessful. When we brought it up at checkout they reduced our rate and comped our breakfast, which was appreciated.The breakfast was the standard, continental fare- eggs, oatmeal, cereal, pancakes, sausage, bacon, toast, bagels, fruit and pastries. It was warm and tasty. The common areas in the hotel were all clean, and everything has been recently updated. The desk staff tried to be helpful- however they didn't have a lot of information about the closed E line which we needed to get back to the airport and didn't put much info into tracking down helpful information. We were able to leave our bags at the hotel after check out, prior to our afternoon flight which was convenient but there was of course a charge. It wasn't much, but when you pay a fair amount for the room having that courtesy extended would be a nice amenity.

Everyone we encountered here was extremely nice and helpful. It is a beautiful hotel in a fun and edgy way. The beds were very comfortable. And having read here on tripadvisor, to turn the showerhead toward the wall, we had no problem with wet floors. The room was clean and fresh every evening when we returned. The decor was unique and charming, We loved the Thai restaurant next door and ate there twice - and Hurley's on the other side is a great place to relax in the evening and regroup for the next day. It is walking distance to theaters and of course, Times Square is at the end of the block.

Everything is on your doorstep.The hotel is beautiful and very new and swanky, although the rooms are small, they're cosy and clean and comfortable. I stayed on the third floor and the wallpaper was a map stating all the places in Manhattan that is famous and how far away they are too. The rooms were cleaned every day and the bathroom was spotless by the time we came back to the room.The staff were lovely and helpful. When I lost a very important ring, I told the member of staff at the front desk and he informed all the cleaning staff and they managed to find it for me.

The only downside to being so close is the noise, even on the 6th floor the noise would wake us up on occasions - a risk of choosing a hotel so close to the central hub of Manhatten. Despite the noise the room was tidy and kept clean on a regular basis. The staff were polite and helpful. Overall if you are looking for a hotel in the centre of the action this is the place for you.

I spent three nights at the hotel at about $400 a night and wasn't able to sleep any night -- the first night I was awakened at 3:45 am by loud shouting and banging sounds that lasted 1/2 hour -- it sounded as if people were being attacked room-by-room. The next morning the front desk knew nothing about this and said only that they get ""angry boyfriends"" from time-to-time. The next night I was awoken at the same time by slamming doors (but no shouting) and the third night very loud country music woke me up at 4:30 -- I called the front desk and they said they could hear it too, but since it was coming from outside, there was really nothing they could do. It continued for 2 1/2 hours -- after which I simply left the hotel (I couldn't fall back to sleep). My only request at check-in was for a quiet room. I couldn't put the fan on high to try to drown out the noise because it didn't work. The rooms were incredibly small, the breakfast buffet had cold food and poor service, the lobby ceiling was leaking so that you couldn't sit in the lobby, etc. And they over-charged me at more than $400 per night.

We chose this hotel based on location because it is just steps from Times Square and all the shops and many food spots. Arrival and check-in was very easy. Although when we first walked in, the pictures made the hotel appear larger than it really was.The room was TINY. For two of us, plus luggage we barely had space to move around. Everything felt very cramped and it made our stay difficult. On top of that the bathroom was even smaller! When you sit on the toilet your knees touch the wall, and I am only 5'3"", so anyone taller would struggle for sure. The shower made no sense to me since it only had half a door. I'm not confident in even calling it a door, more just a half glass wall. So the water gets on the floor, there's no logic there.Being in the middle of Times Square, I expected the hotel to have sound proof windows to cater to its guests. But that was not the case. A couple nights were difficult to get a good nights sleep because of all the noise and activity going on outside. I heard people playing loud music, talking and yelling, and some traffic sounds throughout the night. The air conditioning unit in the room also made it impossible to sleep if you're a light sleeper because it was very noisy.Overall, the hotel was convenient for us to walk around and see the sights.

Of course we had a valid reservation and Tryp finally agreed with the agent that we had a room. Our first room was extremely small, loud because it was on the second floor, had no air conditioning - it was swelteringly hot - and water all over the floor. Back in the lobby the front desk to,d us to just sit around until they decided to fix it... Once again we called the travel agent who got us into another room. No Kleenex, no plugs or docks, not even any glasses - we asked the front desk for glasses and never got any..... We finally got a third room which was clean, etc. However, even with ear plugs it was hard to sleep due to street noise. The shower is half open - glass only covering part of the shower - so the entire bathroom bathes with you. The bathroom is so small I ended up putting on my makeup sitting on the floor. We asked for the maid to set the alarm clock to the correct time. Instead she set the alarm to wake us up at 2 in the morning....The restaurant Tryp markets is closed for renovations....On the plus side: good location, decent enough breakfast, nice marble and tiles.

Check in was very straight forward, and the reception area very lovely and clean so good first impressions. The bedrooms were very small but clean. The bed was comfy with lovely pillows. One of the rooms smelt of smoke so we spoke to reception and they offered us free breakfast and the option to change rooms which was good service. Breakfast was delicious and would recommend, however would not recommend paying full price for it. We used the front desk travel service to book some theatre tickets and the lady working there was so helpful and it was a brilliant and easy way to sort out trips or book tickets etc. Location is great right next to times square so perfect if you want the hustle and bustle. However sleep quality is not good because you are so central and a fire station is right down the street so its very noisy. We were high up on the ninth floor and even then it was loud so if you are a light sleeper then perhaps consider other options. Overall was a pleasant stay and value for money compared to other hotels for a good location.

With our luggages, we barely had enough space to walk, the toilet door couldn't open completely and you had to maneuver around it to get inside but still I was determined not to let that ruin the trip. But the last straw was when I closed the toilet cover to flush and realized dried up pee on the toilet bowl. (It wasn't the husband's cause he hadn't used the toilet yet) I wanted to throw up. There were a lot of other problems I had with the hotel as well - the aircon is so noisy it kept me up all night, the room walls are so thin you can hear everything like when housekeeping opens and shuts the door a million times in the morning and when your drunk neighbor gets back at 4am and starts yelling and fumbling about, knocking over furniture.

For some reason (September 11 commemoration?) it was very difficult to find a hotel in NYC this weekend. We had a party to attend at John Sullivan's bar in Times Square, and wanted to stay nearby. Finally we found a Travelzoo deal at TRYP, which worked out well for us.First impressions of the hotel are that Wyndham is trying to demonstrate a chic, sleek look for this hotel. The lobby is almost surrealistic, with giant white columns reminiscent (to me, at least) of bedside lamps, offset with a mixture of tile and what looks like recovered wood. It's a nice look. There is a bar immediately at the entrance, which you have to walk past to get to the reception desk. From what I saw the bar was not a big deal, there were never many people at it, so the lobby was not very crowded.Our room itself was modern and clean, overlooking 48th Street. This room is not large. There was a queen-sized bed, a small desk, dresser, and bathroom with shower. It's Manhattan- we were not expecting a palace. We were pleased with hoq quiet the room was, even on a busy Saturday night. The one exception to this was the fact that there is a NYFD fire station around the corner, so there were fire trucks with sirens passing by during the night. But there was no noise from neighboring rooms, the hallway, or the elevator.We really only used our room as a place to sleep and change clothes, but for our purposes TRYP was great. And relative to the other hotels on the same weekend, our rate was very good. I would recommend this hotel for one or two people who are looking for a quiet and clean place to stay for a night or two in the Times Square area.","Dover, NH",14,4.0

We got a pretty good deal at just under £400 for 3 nights which is excellent for a city centre hotel in general, especially considering we stayed over Labor Day weekend!The location is excellent; around the corner from Times Square and Broadway, a few minutes away from Rockefeller Centre and Fifth Avenue and about 10/15 minutes away from Central Park. The hotel itself is currently undergoing renovation, the staff have even placed a sign in the lobby to apologise for the hotels appearance whilst the renovations are taking place but the hotel is still clean, modern and well designed, so I should imagine it'll be spectacular once finished.The rooms themselves aren't overly spacious but this didn't bother us. Our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and well equipped. Staff were OK, they were friendly enough and service was efficient from both reception staff and concierge but they didn't make much of an effort to welcome you or provide you with information. That being said, some people don't favour overly enthusiastic staff, so this might not be a bother to some.We were allowed to store bags on check out for a fee of $2 per bag which is reasonable whilst we explored the city before our flight. The only thing that let this hotel down was how they dealt with payment. I provided my card details on booking.com and was told I'd pay the hotel on arrival. My friend decided she would pay for the room on her card instead on check-in so they swiped her card. I then checked my bank balance the day after to discover they'd taken a deposit for the first night from my card for which I wasn't informed. This left a huge dent in my account and not a lot of money on my card which could have potentially ruined our time away in the US. When querying it with the reception staff, they couldn't give me a clear answer and just said ""you must have paid a deposit on your card before you came"". I told them I never and explained it didn't leave me with a lot of money. They then changed their track and said it was an authorisation which would be released on my card within 72 hours...all the time whilst the receptionist was explaining this to me he couldn't look me in the eye and was instead just staring at his computer screen. I wouldn't have minded so much if I was told they were going to authorise/take a deposit or if they could at least give me an explanation and an apology but nothing of this sort. This let the place down.We didn't try breakfast on any of the mornings nor did we use the bar so we can't comment on these aspects.

We left our luggage there for 5 days as we joined a bus coach tour in New York and came back on 23 and 24 July. This was handy for us as we did not want to take the cases with us. We were given Room 627 and the room was a bit larger and the bathroom had a curtain in the shower so this time no problem at all. The location was central to everything, we walked to Times Square and Broadway and St Patrick's Church. The location was spot on for everything. There were lots of eateries around.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful as well - my family and I were really impressed by the quality of service, great job guys! The price we got was great for the location too. Overall, we were happy with our stay and would stay here again. Now for the stuff that needs work: when we first arrived, we were sent to a room that had supposedly been cleaned, but didn't appear clean and smelled as if someone had just smoked a cigarette moments ago. Annoying considering I had just signed a piece of paper saying I'd have to pay $250 if caught smoking in the room. I called down to the front desk and they were super apologetic, and had someone upstairs in 5 minutes with keys to a new, pristine room. They also sent my parents up to their room and it was still being cleaned - well after the designated check in time. While everything in the rooms was good - comfy beds, nice towels, fresh sheets, and working AC to keep us cool - the hallways were consistently dirty, with debris on the floor and service carts/bins in the tight common area. While the rooms were cleaned, the hallways were always neglected. Other things: the lobby bar was cash only or you had to charge drinks to the room, which we thought was odd. The weird half-glass shower door was not my favorite - I would imagine a bigger person would have water going all over the bathroom. You are next to a busy firehouse, which we were fine with as we also live in a city, but if you need complete silence in order to sleep, you may find it a bit noisy (but that's almost anywhere in Manhattan). And of course the rooms are on the small size - but again, you are in NYC, so that is to be expected, and who comes here to hang out in the room anyway, right?

All he could do for us was to ""comp"" their FREE breakfast. It supposedly was ""about a 16 dollar breakfast per person"". Lies! When I looked on their reviews I found out that no one pays for the breakfast. So just beware of the scam they pull with overbooking.

It's very dark and it's best to keep the shades closed day or night as the view isn't spectacular, at least not for us. The room doesn't have a luggage rack, but I used a small side table and my friend used the desk. It is a tight fit but once we arranged our things we got along okay. Our room's entrance also had a long hallway which allowed us some breathing space upon entrance where there was also a tiny closet and space to store your shoes.The bathroom barely fits one average person, and if your cleansing and hair items are in a hanging travel case it would help as there is not shelf or counter. The sink is all there is for storage.

We were in town on one of the hottest weeks of the summer and it was miserable. After long busy days, I spent the evenings staring at the ceiling and sweating.

It is for people who want to be in the centre of New York and experience everything it has to offer. You turn right outside the hotel and you are in time square. You turn left and you are on eighth avenue which has restaurants, bars, pizza etc. There is a fire station, on the corner of 8th avenue and 48th street, so yes you hear fire engines but this is New York and part of the city experience. In fact, if you go down to the fire station and have a look around, you will see plagues of 9/11 colleagues and the fire officers will talk to you. The lobby is clean open and cool which is perfect relief from the baking hot sun. They even had ice cold water with fresh lemon everyday which visitors were welcome to have. The lifts are small, but the bell men were on hand to help people get to their rooms without delays or if lifts had problems they would get them sorted asap. The building is being renovated and they are doing a sterling job. The corridors do look a bit tired, but don't let this put you off I'm sure the hotel will get around to updating them and you can see the priority has been the rooms. We had a family room which had two double king sized beds and a good sized bunk bed. All reviews I've read said that room were small, but our room had plenty of space for a large family. I thought the bathroom was quite large, modern and very functional for the hardcore visitor to freshen up and get back on the New York streets. The air conditioning in the room generates noise, but we were thankful for it because we were perfectly cool all through the night and if you are experiencing New York properly, when your head hits the pillow you are out like a light. Our room was cleaned every day and we had fresh towels and bedcovers. I respect that people want to experience luxury, quite, pampering and people may like to spend down time in these surroundings. New York can offer this at a price! This hotel is comfortable, functional and there can not be a more perfect location for New York hot spots. In relation to cost, my Uncle paid 750 pounds for 3 nights (2 people) in London when I paid 1100 for 5 nights/ 5 people in New York. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but nip next door to Hursley's for some lovely food and the CHEERS experience (I know it was based in Boston!). Last but not least, every day we had fantastic sunshine but the day we left it absolutely threw it down. Our flight left at 22.30, but needed to check out of the hotel by 12pm. The bell men provide a service to store your luggage $2 per bag while you hit the shops for the final time. While I was at the shops my family decided to go to central park and got absolutely wet through. When we got back to the hotel the bell men took them out of storage for them to get changed and then returned them (extremely helpful). Although the hotel is very well linked to the metro I decided to avoid the pouring rain and book the hotel shuttle service to JFK. Unfortunately, due to an accident a couple of blocks away the shuttle got stuck in traffic. I'm sorry I cant remember her name, but a member of hotel staff got on the phone and gave us regular up dates. In the end she arranged an replacement vehicle, when it came to pick us up we were gob smacked! A white stretched limo! Thank you so much! We got the airport in plenty of time and it really finished off a fantastic time in New York city!.","Pontefract, England, United Kingdom",27,4.0

Rooms are small--bathrooms smaller. Smallest toilet bowl I can remember! (Brand is Toto--like the little dog in The Wizard of Oz) If you are a big person, this is not for you. They ask you to reuse towels, but the shower (which has good pressure and is nice) is designed so that you get water on the floor--that's where the towels have to go. My wife complained about the paucity of mirrors. Ai conditioner is a bit noisy--but that is true many places. On the other hand, we got a king bed and it was pretty comfortable.The small desk and chair were serviceable, the TV was good.On the positive side, we got used to the small room etc after a day. The bellmen were very accommodating and helpful checking in and out. The parking is only about a block away and reasonable for NY with the hotel's stamp. The woman who cleaned the room was pleasant and careful. The people at the reception desk were cooperative. sometimes they even did as requested. We tried to get a fridge in the room but despite three requests, it never came. Maybe the brownies for the grandkids will survive anyway. But when I advised that my wife had been hit in the calf while walking and there was no ice in the ice machine, a bellman with a bag of ice appeared within a very few minutes.Being on 48th St is not for me, it turns out. Too crowded. We stayed there because we were going to theater. And that was good. But I do not need the Times Sq area. Uptown and less crowded streets would better for us.So there is it.

Boy, was I wrong. I found the lobby to be actually quite nice, but the fun pretty much ended there. The elevator is more like a coffin than anything else, especially since you age a few years standing and waiting for it. I asked reception to not be put near the elevators in hopes of avoiding noise. So where did he decide to put me? On a floor that was undergoing renovations. Yup, RENOVATIONS. Nowhere during the booking process, or at reception, did anybody mention anything about renovations. They didn't even leave a letter in the room saying ""Excuse The Renovations"". For me, this is kind of inexcusable, especially in a place like New York City where hotel rooms aren't exactly cheap. Why should we pay all this money for a hotel that isn't 100% of what we were promised? Carpets in the hallway were dirty. Maintenance was being done on the walls. Door to my room was rickety and looked like one kick from a 5-year old would be the end of it. The most disappointing aspect was the room size. Rooms are about half the size as they are at the other TRYP hotel. Bathrooms were a bit of a joke, and a mess. It's pretty much impossible to take a shower without the bathroom floor getting soaked, due to the showers not having a door. I hung my towel on the hook on the back of the door and the hook broke off. I would understand these kinds of things if I stayed in a motel or something or an airport hotel for a layover, but not from a WYNDHAM hotel in the middle of Manhattan. The bed was a low-cost spring bed and one side was visibly higher than the other. Room decor itself was nice. Staff weren't exactly attentive or welcoming, with the exception of the guy who organizes breakfast, who was very nice. The thing that bothered me the most was that the maintenance crews were working in the small hallways and sometimes on the room doors themselves. If I can hear them, they can hear the guests. What if a couple was having an argument or private conversation? Or more? Nobody wants an audience. There are 2 different schools of thought about hotels. Some people say 'You're just there to sleep, so it doesn't really matter'; whereas other people, myself included, like to enjoy the hotel. Maybe one day I don't feel like traipsing around the city and I want to relax and enjoy the hotel (it is a holiday!), I want the hotel to be nice. It also bothers me that the manager's response to our criticisms is a cut-and-pasted answer that they put on every review, while saying that most of the reviews are amazing...which they're not.Most of the positive feedback about the hotel has been about the location, which is great, but that only gets you so far. Manhattan isn't even that big. Nowhere is more than 20 mins on a subway, and any hotel is bound to be close to some landmark. Isn't the whole point of a vacation to explore the city, anyways? You can't get away with sub-standard service and amenities simply because you've got a good location.Overall, I think if you're there for a night or two and just need a bed to sleep in, then fine, go for it. But if you're on a vacation where you want to relax, maybe have a friend over for a drink and enjoy the hotel...I'd go for the other TRYP hotel, or pay a few extra bucks and stay somewhere else.","London, United Kingdom",3,3.0

The hallway are tight, bedrooms and bathrooms are small (like any hotel in a big city), clean bathrooms and clean bed yes for sure, decor is modern. This hotel is nothing fancy or extremely high end BUT it is perfect just for what I mentioned previously. Excellent location, steps from Times Square and also the restaurant row which has plenty of restaurants on one street. Hotel is close to public transportation and taxis will stop any time here.
