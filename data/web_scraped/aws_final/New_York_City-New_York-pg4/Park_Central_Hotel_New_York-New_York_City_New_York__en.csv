Cheryl at the front desk was amazing. She’s an asset to the hotel. The room was clean and efficient. Ten minutes after checking out I called the hotel because I left a brand new necklace that was a birthday gift on the desk in the room. I was connected to housekeeping and security who located my necklace. Trudy from housekeeping took my credit card number and address to send me my necklace and that’s the last trace of my necklace. Numerous phone calls and emails failed to produce any answers. If the necklace wasn’t found I’d understand but to get to that point and the ball to be dropped certainly tainted my opinion of the hotel.,,0,1.0

And the maid, Maritza, is amazing. She made us feel really good during our visit.The hotel is very well located in the city. But maybe they should add the possibility to have lunch or dinner there. That was our bigger struggle during our New York trip.On the other hand, there are only two elevators available for all the guests, so you have to wait a lot to go to your room or outside. Also we booked a double room, with two beds specifically, but when we arrived they gave us a one bed room and to get another room we must pay almost the double that we already did.Except for those details, it's a good place to stay.

I honestly never thought we'd be able to afford it due to crazy prices. Well for our 19th wedding anniversary, he completely surprised me with a week at Park Central Hotel. I thought for sure he broke the bank for this trip but I finally got the pricing out of him. All I can say is WOW, for the price, I don't think it can be beat. The hotel itself is really nice, the staff is wonderful and very helpful and did I mention the location? It's probably a 3 to 5 minute walk to Times Square and about, if I remember correctly, a 5 to 8 minute walk to Central Park. There are great places to eat and even get midnight cheesecake right around the corner. I usually stay in the East Village area, Alphabet City and the like, or Queens. You can get a lot for your money in the East Village. All that being said, this was the best week of my life. You really can't go wrong with Park Central Hotel. When searching for lodging the price may scare you because it is really low compared to others in the vicinity. Don't let that happen, it will exceed your expectations.

The elevator was so slow that we would deliberately pack extra supplies to avoid having to return to the room any more than absolutely necessary.

The rooms are absolutely huge, we had two double beds and the room was so big that it was almost like having two separate rooms. We had arrived to New York early and were able to do an early check in. Both check in and valet for our car were quick, smooth, and efficient, despite how busy the staff was! The little marketplace in the lobby is super convenient for busy mornings. I was overwhelmingly impressed by the hotel overall. Unfortunately, there was one issue regarding my room which wasn’t dealt with in a timely manner which was absolutely inexcusable for what a quick fix it could’ve been, BUT that being said- I recommend not responding to any texts sent from the hotel if you have a complaint or trying to communicate issues with them that way. Even guest relations were overwhelmed and had to be asked a couple times to deal with my issue. Instead, if you have a big/consistent problem, ask for Darren who was beyond wonderful. He’s the hotel manager and it’s very obvious how much he cares about the quality of your stay. He was quick to fix the problem I had been dealing with and communicated with me every step of the way. I could not say enough good things about him, or Rosa, if I might add even more praise. She’s one of the housekeepers at Park Central and she is fast, thorough, and genuinely kind!Although I had a slight hiccup with my stay, I would still recommend this hotel to just about anyone!

Our room was clean and nice. The hotel in general is clean and nice, and is within walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. It is not directly by Central Park though. The bar is beautiful, and the cafe next door is really good.That said, we experienced a number of issues with this hotel:-The staff: Aside from the room service staff, everyone else in this hotel seemed angry or like they were doing you a favor to help you. Basically, they were rude. -Expect to wait for a very long time for an elevator. We were on the 8th floor, and people were waiting so long for the elevator to arrive, they chose to take the stairs. Us included. In fact, this is the worst wait for an elevator I've ever experienced, hotel or otherwise.-Our room key deactivated itself at least 5 times over our 2-day stay. One time, after numerous attempts at reseting a card, they ended up sending security up with us to let us in our room. Just like the elevator, this was the worst experience I've had with a room key.-Even though our room looked nice, there were issues. The hardware holding the shampoo and soap bottles in the shower kept falling apart. Very frustrating when you're taking a shower. Also, the shower curtain was too small for the shower, meaning that the floor was soaking wet when you get out of the shower, and it took multiple towels to soak the water up.-Speaking of towels, we called the front desk to get towels delivered one morning, and 20 minutes later we still had no towels. Called again. Fifteen minutes later, no towels. We finally went down to the front to retrieve our towels. This hotel definitely looks the part, but it did not deliver on the little things for us.","Birmingham, Alabama",13,2.0

Dust across the tile trim in the bathroom, a broken toilet roll holder. The floor lamp flickered so couldn't be used. There was a bedside table missing ( this was a king room). The drawers fell out if pulled out more than 6-8 inches.The deadlock wasn't working on the main door to the room, so we didnt feel safe at night and had to push a chair up against the door.I complained several times while there and was informed it would all be sorted. It wasn't. The bathroom was indeed cleaned, but not the tile trims, they still had a lot of dust on them and the tiles had streaks on them.I paid extra for the location and the security for my daughter and I, but I'm afraid I couldn't recommend this hotel due to the lack of response to my complaint both whilst there and now we are back home.

It's a reasonably priced hotel, with the ambience of a basic Luxury Hotel, in a sea of overpriced accommodations near Central Park South and Rockefeller Center. Before my trip, I contacted the manager to inquire about several tax and other fees tacked onto the Room Charges, mostly mandated by the city. I immediately received an email from Tony Cunaj, the Complex Director of Reservations, that was welcoming and informative. Tony offered to upgrade my room and provide a senior discount, although I only just qualify for the latter. Although I opted not to use my credit card rewards, he was also willing to make an exception in my booking to allow me to use them towards my bill. Tony certainly earned my loyalty and deserves a commendation from whomever he reports to as an asset to the hotel.The hotel bellman, Jaime, met me upon my early arrival and stored my baggage without delay. The hotel is nicely appointed and has a large bar and meeting area behind the lobby desks that was ideal for spending time with family. I found the room very clean, quiet and comfortable with a nice view. Although there isn't a restaurant on premises, there's a Starbucks for morning coffee adjacent to the hotel and plentiful dining options nearby within a block or two.

I finally just went to bed when it hadn’t arrived in 1-1/2 hours. The room was cold and the beds don’t have a real blanket on them, so I requested some extras. Housekeeping called the room and told us the hotel turned off the heat as it is warm outside? Really, it was 30 degrees last night. Warmer today, but the room is cold. Why would you turn off the heat in January when you live in NYC? Their solution, bring us a space heater. It's really too bad because this is a nice hotel and clean, but it takes too much effort to fix all of the issues on arrival. Every time we stay here, I have to spend the time and effort to fix problems. No heat, no blankets, bathtub doesn't hold water, etc. I just want to book a hotel, arrive, get to my room and find everything working. It doesn't have to be fancy or perfect.

The Classic King room, was the perfect size for two. My husband and I like to workout during our vacations, and we took full advantage of the gym. This is not a typical hotel gym, in that there was a pair of Peloton bikes, several other pieces of cardio equipment, and multiple options for weights, kettlebells and plenty of space. We enjoyed drinks at the hotel bar and were tended to by friendly bartenders. And the location was excellent.... It's about a five minute walk to the entrance of Central Park and about 10 minutes the other direction, takes you right into Time's Square. My husband and I stood out in front of the hotel and we were able to see the ball drop at midnight, to ring in the New Year, which was perfect for us.

I wish I never had. The first hurdle was construction in front of the hotel with no way to pull your car up to unload. We had tried to call the hotel earlier to determine if they had valet parking, but for hours, we only got a busy signal so we decided to take chance. No luck. After parking elsewhere, we arrived to find chaos in the lobby. The people at the front desk, while not outwardly rude, seemed as if they were annoyed with having to register us. The elevator situation is awful with people crowded into a small space waiting for only two elevators. The room was comfortable enough, but the first night, the party in the next room started singing and shouting with loud music at 4:30 a.m. I called to reception to ask them to send security. A half hour later, when nothing happened, I called again. I was told they were on their way. A full hour after my first call, I called again and was again told they were on their way. I asked whether they were coming from Hoboken! At that point, my husband got dressed and went down to the front desk. Shortly after that, I heard security knock next door. The music stopped, I could hear talking, and then security left. Ten minutes later the music was back on. We later went to reception and asked to have our room changed because I couldn't go through another night like that. The man at reception waved me away to a customer service desk. After much maneuvering, another room was reserved for us but we had to check our luggage as the room wasn't ready. The second night was better but we couldn't wait to leave. I was hoping we could get a bellman to get us a cab since the street was blocked with construction, but no bellman, no doorman. We walked a block to get a taxi.

Our check in was efficient, the individual who checked us in was fine but nothing above or beyond. Room was clean and modern, however the WiFi didn't reach our room so we both racked up hefty data usage amounts and also the phone in our room didn't work to call (we could have mentioned this in passing downstairs but there never seemed to be a good time & we also were in the room minimally). The hotel snack bar is a bit of a joke and I wouldn't recommend relying on it. If you go to the lobby for a drink it's quite nice, but the staff is rude (unless you get lucky and get Nancy who is amazing).Overall the hotel was nicely decorated, clean and in a good location but I wouldn't return due to underwhelming experiences we had with their staff.","Toronto, Canada",2,3.0

Well we weren’t disappointed. Had a fantastic stay at this hotel. Very clean, comfortable beds, great location, close to Times Square about 15/20 minute walk, about a 5 minute walk to Central Park, Starbucks next door and a Subway station right on the corner of the hotel, literally less than a minute walk.The house keepers were fantastic, very friendly and competent. Great job. Thank you ladies, we appreciated the job you did very much.Khianna was our concierge for the week. She was fantastic, very friendly and literally anything we wanted to know or wanted to do she was able and willing to help. From directions, what trains to take, down to booking tickets for basketball, broadway shows and even booking a table at a restaurant for us. Every time she would give us confirmations of what she had done via what’s app. So Khianna if you get to read this thank you so much. A couple of gripes, the Wi-fi didn’t work in our room on the 8th floor, eventually got sorted out. The scaffolding outside was a bit of an eye saw but not the end of the world. Also wasn’t expecting the outside noise to be quite so noticeable, again not the end of the world, I’m guessing it’s just typical New York life!One last thing could have done with some tea/coffee facilities in the room that you even get for free in most other hotels, would have been nice to start our busy New York days with a cup of tea or coffee. You could buy a tea or coffee in the downstairs market but a little over priced in my opinion. Sorry Park Central but we used the Starbucks next door.These however were minor things and didn’t change our outlook or opinion of our stay in the hotel. We would recommend this hotel highly!",,2,5.0

There are a few tips/thoughts I have to share about staying here...When checking in, stand between the two green boxwoods in the front of hotel and wait to be called over to the desk. We did not realize this because we were brought in from the side, where the sister hotel that connects is located, (after dropping our vehicle off for valet.) A worker behind the front desk very bluntly and rudely told us where we should be...we literally just walked in and we’re trying to figure out where to go....not a great first impression...but it got better. Carolyn checked us in and out; she was very fast and efficient and friendly. She answered every question I had and was very patient.  I booked two rooms for this stay, requested early check-in for both, not really sure if rooms would be ready early but one actually was...I was so happy about this!!! Also when booking, I requested high floors with views; the only disappointment I had is that only one of our rooms had a good view. I even asked to be moved after seeing our room...front desk was supposed to be contacted but never reached out. If you want a coffee pot and coffee in your room, simply ask! They will accommodate!!! Also, Starbucks is two doors down from hotel. The small sandwich/pastry shop in the hotel was good but is more like a grab and go. There are good restaurants nearby-The Redeye Grill has a great breakfast. Ask for extra towels daily. Elevators are a little slow but our wait was not bad to go up/down. Just research this hotel on the website and call to ask specific questions before booking, so you know more of what to expect. The bellmen/doormen were wonderful to help us get our luggage in/out and our vehicle parked and brought back to us quickly. I think Bobby helped us—cannot remember his name—but phenomenal service.The front of the hotel is under construction but it was not a problem for us. I didn’t hear noise at night either but I also brought a sound machine and have a sound app on my phone to drown out noise. The only problem we had was making a right turn to the sister hotel so we could valet the vehicle upon arrival. The street was closed and we told the policeman we had to get to our hotel so she let us by. We were asked daily during our stay if we needed anything and every request was made, with exception of room change. Thank you Kurt, Michaela, Mandenise, Erika! Location is great. Very clean & modern—Gloria was our housekeeper—what a sweetheart! All the staff who helped us have been very well trained; they work hard to accommodate, give them a raise—they deserve it. We will stay here again!",,0,4.0

I literally couldn’t wait for our nyc weekend and thought I found a gem in the heart of NYC but I was so wrong. I called the hotel a few days prior to check in to ask about the valet parking. The morning of arrival we pulled up only to see that the front entrance is completely under renovation and there was nowhere to pull over, we pulled around to the side of the hotel and there was no one there, just a bunch of cabs. We did two laps before a valet from another hotel told us that we have to go inside to the front desk and tell them we are checking in and they will come out to get our car. Um, what the heck? First of all that is completely inconvenient and would have been nice if the person on the phone told me that. We finally go to check in, our room wasn’t ready which was fine, we were early. My boyfriend, a military vet who served three tours overseas, asks the gentleman if they offer a military discount to which he answered “yes but you would have needed to book that ahead of time.” I get it,but seriously, someone is asking and it’s something that you offer for a reason, you couldn’t have honored it? That left a really poor taste in my mouth. The only thing he could offer was an early check in for $100. When our room was finally ready, we check in and ask the bellman to grab our bags, to which he starts dragging them on the floor to bring to us. If they were too heavy please ask for help, don’t drag my stuff! We finally get to the room and it’s a room with two beds, I booked a king. I call the front desk and the concierge, she transfers me to the front desk where I am on hold for five minutes before I am disconnected. I call back, voicemail. So now I have to back downstairs and I am pissed at this point to say the least. The front desk claims I booked a “deal of the day” where there is no room assignment Until check in. I definitely didn’t book anything that said deal of the day, did I book the best available rate, yes of course I did, with a photo of a king bed. I wait to speak to a manager who literally could have cared less and sent me on my way. The only way they could help me was if I paid for an upgrade. Again, the only time they can help you with anything is if you want to pay extra. I go back to my room and check on their website and low and behold they have rooms available for tonight, at a lower rate than what I paid, and king beds available. The manager claims i was upgraded to a room with two queens instead of the two twins that I booked, I have a queen at home, these are not Queen beds. The room is tiny, the bathroom even tinier and I am looking out the window over roof top machinery. Do yourself a favor and RUN! There are a million other hotels in the area, stay at one of those.

There was scaffolding outside the hotel and a work platform was directly outside our window which meant we had to keep our blinds drawn causing the room to be a little dark.

The hotel is hidden behind scaffolding and with major works taking place on the street you cannot get a taxi to the front door. The Premier King room was spacious - very important on an international trip - and spotlessly clean, the bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was compact but had a great shower. Lots of street noise despite being 12 floors up. The chambermaids were friendly and did a great job. Only two lifts served the 12th floor so it could take a while to get one in the mornings.The hotel (like most in NY nowadays) charges an obscene mandatory ""facilities fee"" of $40 per night for things that should be included (like storing bags) and things we would never use (like local phone calls, the business centre, and gym). In fairness they are upfront about this but its still appalling.The check-in and checkout receptionists were very unfriendly and robotic (upon checkout we were told to go to the concierge desk to drop off our bags, we said there was no-one there but she told us to wait, only after five minutes when a line formed did she do anything about calling a staff member to that desk).Overall its a good hotel in a good location (if they didnt charge the ""facilities fee"" it may have got five stars)","Navan, Ireland",50,4.0

We booked months in advance thinking we we’re getting a good deal. The final price was much higher than we were expecting but since it was under construction, we were given a discount down to what we thought the price was going to be so that was nice. The room was much smaller than we imagined. There wasn’t a view. It was worn looking as well. The wallpaper was peeling but the beds were comfy and it appeared clean. We were gone all day, everyday so the room wasn’t the priority part of our trip. It suited our needs just fine. I think we’d stay there again because the location was prime. It was a safe location. The staff were friendly. We had no issues with anyone. My only complaint would be the slow and crowded elevators as everyone here has already mentioned. Otherwise, it was a very good experience.","Broomfield, Colorado",28,4.0

However, the hotel is under construction and is encased in scaffolding. There was some minor disturbance because of that during the day.One issue worth mentioning - this hotel has small, slow elevators. At one point we had to wait in a line for 20 minutes to get onto the elevator. And the elevator cars are small. Eight people is a tight squeeze. Often on the way down, the elevator door would open, people were standing waiting in the hall, and the car was already full. So they would have to continue to wait.The staff was somewhat ""meh"".

Things seemed a little unorganised but we were seen quickly enough. We received a nice welcome and all seemed to be going well until the lady that was assisting us picked up the phone and began to scold a colleague on the phone, she swore and had this conversation right in front of us, instead of just waiting for us to head to our room. We were asked for a credit card for a deposit - which we handed over but we got a little frustrated when we realised that no explanation to what the deposit covered or how much they had charged. We stayed on the 16th floor. The room had a huge bed which was comfortable. The only problem with the bed was that there was blood on the duvet cover which I felt was pretty disgusting. I discovered this on the morning we checked out. The rooms are outdated, old and tired. They just simply need a good clean. The carpets are tired, stained and dusty. The shower and bathrooms were small and dark. There was toothpaste all over the walls and fingernail clippings on the towel shelf. The temperature in our room we couldn’t seem to get control over. The room seemed to be naturally warm already and then the air-con blasted out warm air also. Unfortunately I fell ill during my visit to New York. Staying in a room which is at 25degrees celsius when you have a 40 degree fever and unable to open the window wasn’t an enjoyable experience. Annoying, despite there being almost 20+ floors, there are only two lifts in the hotel. So be prepared to wait at least 10 minutes for a lift to your floor. If that one doesn’t fill up. We had paid for bed and breakfast. Breakfast consisted on a stale pastry, a bottle of water or a coffee and an apple. A hotel breakfast? Obviously this was disappointing. And there is no tea/coffee or water in rooms either. I bought a bottle of water from the hotel and it cost $7. The hairdryer in my room was broken. Concierge didn’t answer the phone and didn’t return my messages, nor did they replace the hairdryer. We feel that this hotel is in a wonderful location, the neighbourhood is busy and exciting and there are local delis, tourist hotspots and so close to Central Park. Perhaps this hotel would benefit from new management that are excited about running a hotel. From our experience staff are tired and fed up. We stayed in New York for 3 days and travelled from Milan Italy. I don’t think if we are to return to New York, that we would stay in this hotel again and we don’t feel we are able to recommend the hotel either.",,0,2.0

Location of the hotel is the real selling point as it was 5 minute walk from Times Square and 2 minute walk to Central Park. In addition there are a couple of different metro stations just round the corner from the hotel. Hotel lobby was nice and modern and very well done with a small coffee shop/store inside. Didn't use the bar however drinks prices seemed quite expensive. Room was nice and again modern with chromecast TV which was useful. Downside was that the view from the window looks into other rooms so need to have blinds down most of time and even with them open its very dark which so need lights on all the time. Bathroom is ok, small but it is New York so as expected. There was always a delay with the Lifts and often had to let lifts go and wait however we were only 4th floor so often used stairs instead to save time. Quite an expensive hotel for what it is but again paying for prime location which does come in handy.","Colchester, United Kingdom",1,4.0

But there is no choice: You pay the USD 36 regardless. (The leaflet in the room says 35, but you are charged 36.) The implication is that advertised prices on comparison sites will show this hotel cheaper than it actually is. Very annoying!","Greifensee, Switzerland",2,2.0

The location of this hotel is fantastic! It’s central to many of New York’s landmark spots including Central Park and has many transit points very close by. The hotel lobby is spacious and has a very natural and zen like feeling upon entry. The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately, the hotel has not kept up with the tech times so be sure to pack your wall chargers and music speakers. The rooms do not have USB ports and the speaker that it does have on the night stand is for the iPhone 4 model (does anyone even use that one anymore?!) There are only 2 elevators for this huge hotel and they are quite small so be ready to wait when heading out or coming in. We had various disappointing encounters with staff members that were a. Not interested in serving/helping us and b. Not happy to be working there. When asking about details for the gym, the gentleman at the front desk was more concerned about his iMessage convo on his cell phone than assisting us.There is an additional daily charge of $40 CAD for WiFi (open connection, no password), gym use and who knows what else. Unfortunately, when booking there is no notice about the hotel’s gym facility being under construction. They will provide you with passes to Crunch fitness two blocks over. So there is an extra cost that you will pay daily to be an inconvenienced guest. Also, the Crunch fitness studio staff are also not friendly or helpful.The location of this hotel was the main attraction for the Park Central and I’m not sure that we would stay here again in future.","Toronto, Canada",19,3.0

While in Canada I got a confirmation email saying that I had only booked for two adults. I panicked as I had my son too. So I messaged the hotel no reply, and then had to use my mobile to phone them. I got through to central reservations who could not help and told me to phone the front desk, front desk told me to contact inhouse reservations, 5 times I was passed from pillar to post getting cut off each time! It wasn't until I got through to someone else at the front desk she was able to say it wasn't a problem as they don't charge for children. May I say tho when we got into the room it was set up for three with towels!Check in was OK, we arrived early and was given the option of getting into the room and for $90 as it was ready (no thanks). We checked our luggage in and went exploring. Came back to pick up the room key and the guy at the desk was not pleasant at all.Our room looked on to a building site and there was a note in our room saying we may wish to lower the blinds for privacy due to the work and there may be noise which would start at 8am. The first two mornings this did not bother us as we were up early, this morning after three full busy days in New York we could have done without the loud banging especially when my son was knacked.Also I got my period by suprise one day my hubby went down and asked if they had anything to hand until we went to the shop, the hotel does not keep any incidentals like that by the way and was shown the way to the nearest chemist. As for the resort fee, yes I would say its a rip off. $135 for storaging some luggage. No water or coffee in the room (Sheraton in Nigara had water and coffee), no fridge I really don't see how they can get away with charging the extra. I would not say any staff were particularly welcoming or pleasant but to he honest this time we found the most of NY like that. Also everytime you left the hotel the front was full of people trying to get you to buy the buses, and stuff. Surely this could be moved away from the door? The room was fine although a bit dark and bed comfy Yes the hotel is in a good location from the subway and times square but really I wouldnt say I felt I had good value for my money and wouldn't stay here again.

We arrived around midnight on a weeknight and had requested a King room but were not guaranteed one. We were told that one was available with a smaller bathroom, so we went ahead and grabbed it, ready to get some rest after a long flight.After our first night in our room, we decided that while we enjoyed the hotel, we didn't like our specific room for a few reasons of our own. We approached the managers the next day to discuss what our options were. Darren helped us out and gave us some options that we could swap to within Park Central or at their neighboring sister hotel, WestHouse. He very patiently and politely walked us through each option, showed us a potential room we could move over to, and took the lead on handling the entire transition to the WestHouse the following day. I had booked through a third party, so there were a few extra steps involved, but with Darren's attentive help, things were handling very smoothly and seamlessly! He even offered us some great perks to help offset the annoyance of needing to re-pack/check-out and check-in to the new room. All in all, my fiancé and I were both thoroughly impressed!

While nothing in the US is a patch on what we take for granted in Asia, the staff at the hotel was bad by American standards as well. For instance, the woman at the front desk did not say clearly if breakfast was included in the package or not.We reached the hotel a little after noon and but there was no clarity on whether an early check-in was possible or not(we had put in a request for it).

Read reviews before coming and a bit nervous but couldn't be more pleased. Staff pleasant n friendly, bar a great place to relax and no dearer than local bars. Romm was superb. Large, clean with amazingly large bed. Very clean bathroom. Room cleaned daily. Read of problems with lifts but we had none even on the busy weekend. Cafe in lobby was adequate for breakfast/snacks, with plenty of variety locally as an alternative. Can't understand reviews complaining of views from room? You don't go on a visit to NYC for views from your room you go outside and experience the city! Only 2 minor gripes. Firstly safe in our room was broken and still not replaced when we left (room 665), but we worked around this so not a major issue. Secondly, the cafe seemed run out of lots of breakfast food by 8ish and then bring out same goodies about 9ish for lunch. Why they didn't just keep replenishing items as they run out in the morning without the pause? Most people are out and about for luncheon. Only a minor gripe but it meant people went elsewhere locally so hotel lost that revenue.Can recommend the Italian restaurant a block or so to the left or the Stagecoach Tavern to the right for local eating. Would also highly recommend Patsys on 56th st behind Hotel. This is Frank Sinatra's favourite place. Food was best Italian I have ever had, including that in Italy! Service first class and surprisingly for palace with such a history was cheaper than most places locally.Hotel is located above 57th St subway which has lined N,Q,R which get you to most places.Overall a brilliant places to stay!",,3,5.0

They are smelly and never stop the water from going all over the floor. Only one lift was working during our stay so we had to wait around for ages to get to and from our room on the 11th floor. There are no coffee or tea making facilities in the room which I have never ever come across before.

Overall the hotel is really nice as you walk in and all the staff are very helpful. A lot of people mentioned to me in the lift that they were a bit disappointed in the lack of Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room, but little did they know that if you asked at reception they could provide you with this and a fridge at your request. We were expecting to be charged for this but we weren't so take advantage of it!Being in Manhattan, be expected to pay more than usual and venture a bit out of the way for cheaper eats and drinks. The hotel itself is huge and only has two lifts which can be very frustrating at times, but people have places to go and places to be. I would say if you are feeling fit, use the stairs as there is some really nice Jazz artwork in the stairway. (Floors 3-Ground if I remember).The Room: We had a room with two double beds and it was big enough for us both. It had a few flaws which I would have expected better from a posh hotel. The drawers did not close in the chest or bed side tables. The bathroom mirror wasn't glass, but a sticker which was peeling off and the bathroom also smelt a little bit damp.Cleanliness: I am a bit of a neat and dust spotting freak so I was dusting myself most of the time. I also left a hair on the back of the toilet to see if this would be cleaned...it was there for 3 days!However, we were only sleeping in the room, so to me they are all little things to me, but could be big for others.What I also found weird (may have just been because I have never experienced this before) was that if we did not want our room cleaned for that day, reception left us a message advising that if they did not come the next day, we may be ""charged""? So keep that in mind if you want a lay in!It is a bit on the pricey side for hotels, but it is worth the pennies as it is a nice hotel and the staff are always very eager to help and chat.","Warwick, United Kingdom",7,4.0

Our problem began with the elevators - they were a big pain because out of the two, one elevator was out of service and the other one was extremely slow. Every time we had to wait for at least 10 -15 minutes to get into an elevator. Plus, the elevator would stop at every floor making it very slow and time consuming. The exteriors had scaffolding all over - presumably the building was under repairs!The room size was rather small for a Double room to accommodate four adults - we felt very cramped as there wasn't enough space to keep our luggage and move around freely. Add to it the lighting in the room was very poor and dim because there were inadequate lights! There was no brightness in the room and the dull atmosphere was depressing.The room had no view. The 1st room assigned to us had a very small - prison cell - like window which opened to a wall outside! When we requested for a change, another room ""with a view” was assigned to us, but it was marginally better. The window's size was a little bigger and the view was of the terrace of the adjoining building and the scaffolding of the hotel.The hotel staff declined our one-time request for some empty plates and did not assist us by providing any connectors/sockets to charge our cell phones. Water bottles in the room were also at a charge! Some of the staff 'demanded' tips which was surprising as to tip is the guest's discretion - cannot be demanded nor should the guest be forced to tip.This was the 1st time ever and hopefully the last time that we will patronize this hotel.

Stayed around this area in various boutique hotels as well as UES because it’s close to Central Park. We checked in to this hotel with my husband Saturday afternoon and our worst NYC hotel experience started. When we arrived at the valet parking, there was another car pulled up in front of us, so we were ignored as if the valet boy couldn’t see a full size SUV right in front of your hotel door. We had to take out all of our own luggage, no trolley for us to use, and no help offered. We dragged our luggage inside, it’s only when we got into the line to check-in, a man hurried over and gave us a slip - which they charged us EXTRA because our car is bigger than standard. See the irony here? When it’s your turn to service us, you couldn’t us even if our car is ‘XL’, but when it’s your turn to charge us, all of a sudden our car is ‘XL’.Fine, a little bit extra, who cares, let’s move on.We dropped off our own luggage in the room, and headed out to Broadway show. BTW highly recommend To Kill a Mockingbird in Schubert. We returned to the hotel room 11:30PM. When we got into the room we heard a high-pitch squeaking noise from the bathroom. Went in to check what’s going on , turned out the shower faucet was making the constant noise. It was so loud that with a closed bathroom door we couldn’t even hear our TV. Called the Maintenance number, lady on the phone told us she put in a service ticket but no ETA for the fix, and that most likely tomorrow morning. I turned on the speaker and asked if she could hear the noise herself. She confirmed she did - so she sent a guy here around midnight. The guy checked around and said there’s nothing he could do right there then. He suggested us sleeping with a closed bathroom door. We asked him to try it himself to see if it’s possible. He realized it’s still crazy loud but he couldn’t do anything. We told him to report this to the front desk and we would need to change rooms.Then the front desk called us, saying they are 100% booked for the night, and no other room available. We offered to pay extra for an upgrade but were refused. The lady offered to waive our resort fee - which is really nice of her but didn’t solve our problem. As we were not ready to repack our luggage again and try to find another hotel room in NYC after midnight, she said she would send us some earplugs. Then a maid came with ONE pair of earplug , when on the registration it clearly said TWO guests. She whined about how she had to go back and get another pair for us , and made us wait until 1:30AM. We were both too tired with the drama for the past 2 hours so we fell asleep with earplugs and headphones of our own music.The next day around the plumber banged on our door SO loud when we were still in bed. Understood he's got his work to finish off as well, we hurried out of the room.When we returned the same night, we didn't hear the noise again so we assume it was fixed. Oh boy were we so naïve. It was only the opening to the worst hotel drama ever. 1:30AM when we were asleep, the Fire alarm went off - wasn't a loud panicking noise, and it only went for four beeps and stopped. Assuming everything was fine, my husband and I tried to go back to sleep because we didn't hear anything in the hallway. However the concierge started to speak on the broadcast saying 'Attention Please! Attention Please! Please Disregard the fire alarm.' It served as a trigger for EVERY SINGLE HOTEL guest to start running around. We could hear footsteps upstairs, screaming in the hallway all of a sudden after that broadcast. The concierge went off to broadcast the exact same message 4 TIMES within 10 minutes. Come on, obviously your message is NOT understood by the guests (otherwise they would have stopped running), say something else? Use some empathy please? Most of your hotel guests are from places where English is not their first language. All they heard is 'Attention……. Fire alarm' , of course they would run!Finally it took him 5 times of try to say 'It is a false alert'. But people were still running, and the chaos finally died down around 2:30AM.Finally we thought we would get some rest - until 4:01AM - the high-pitch squeaking noise in the bathroom CAME BACK - so loud that it scared me and I jumped out of bed. I went to shut the bathroom door and had to put on my headphone + earplug to sleep through the rest of the night.The next morning at 10AM AGAIN, a guy came banging on our door when we were still asleep (after only being able to sleep for 6 hours). Said he was the plumber and tried to fix the problem. My husband was polite enough to tell him that Service Request was sent on Saturday and someone already showed up yesterday - but the problem was not fixed. He immediately took off without even further examine it. Good luck to the next guests in our unit - you are going to have quite a few more nights of high-pitch squeaking noise in the middle of the night from the bathroom.In short, the reason why I wrote out my entire horrible experience is to help some other people to NOT experience it again.

Keep in mind that individually, these items are not that bad but all together, they made for an unpleasant experience when we were expecting a seamless stay.1. Room change with no reason provided. We arrived in our room and promptly received a phone call from the front desk telling us that our room needed to change. No reason was given. We were told someone would be by with our new room key. We waited a few minutes.... no one came. We were just sitting there with our 4 year old, waiting to unpack.... So we called down and were told someone would be by shortly. When we met the employee, he asked us why we were moving as even he didn’t know. This was disappointing after we had waited around most of the day to check in and all we wanted to do was unpack.2. Elevator out of service. 1 of the 4 elevators was out of service for our full week stay. We understand this happens. There was no warning at the desk however and waits for the elevators were quite long every day. To make it more annoying, there was a sign on the elevators telling guests to use the service elevator unless they were carrying luggage. Quite an interesting experience when you get on the service elevator and surprise the employees who are moving dirty dishes and had no idea guests would be using the elevator. Employees we met on the elevator were very nice and we just made a joke out of it. Still, not a great experience.3. TV not initially working. When we arrived in our room and when we arrived in our second room (see point 1.), the TV’s were quite fuzzy, to the point they could not really be watched. Only after we spoke with the front desk, and they sent someone to look at the TV, were we told that they had just changed to a new service and the TV would work fine after being on for a few minutes. Would have been great to receive a warning at check in. Completely understandable if we had known in advance. 4. Under Construction. As many buildings in NY seem to be going through, this building has scaffolding everywhere. Not an ideal view. Would have been nice to have this at least acknowledged at check in. I know the staff cannot prevent this. 5. Tub drain plug kept coming out. This seems very minor, but we had to fiddle with the drain plug to get it to actually work. This was necessary for me to bath my 4 year old. This is the sort of thing I would expect to not have to deal with.6. No floor mat. Some days we would have a floor mat for the bathtub and other days, there wouldn’t be one so I used a hand towel to step on after getting out of the shower. Again, quite minor but annoying when added to other things.7. Key deactivated early. On the day we were set to check out, my husband went to the gym at 6 am. When he came back about 45 minutes later, his key did not work. I’ve never had my key deactivated prior to actually leaving the hotel. Not sure if this is normal?Overall, the hotel was clean and many of the staff we ran into were pleasant. But based on other reviews and the level of hotel, I would not have expected these items to happen or at least not be acknowledged prior to.",Canada,1,2.0

We saw all the attractions on our list (love that they give you a free hour bike rental w/ purchase of one hour from the place in the same building) and the super sweet concierge gal helped us with questions about the subway and bus (which is free in the summer!). The subway/bus to La Guardia was $5.50 for the two of us versus $60 for a cab. The hotel manager, Daron, was very present and helped when the front desk was busy and when one elevator had trouble (showing us to another). They gave us two queen beds instead of a King (which we preferred) and an end room so we had windows on two sides. Rooms are small as is customary in NYC, but I did not find them cramped at all, and in fact, felt the design was great.

The hotel is close to Central Park and very close to the subway. All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly and accommodating. Our room was large for typical city size-this is one of the few hotels in the city that actually had 2 queen beds. The room and bathroom were clean and the beds were very comfortable with king sized pillows. The downside was that only 1 (ONE!) elevator was working to get guests up to their rooms. This became extremely frustrating as we had difficulty getting both up AND down to/from our room. (Especially in the 98 degree heat when all you want is to get to your room and relax.) They offered the service elevator for guests to use but that was glitchy also and our average wait for an elevator was ridiculous. Also, the ice machine on our floor never worked, despite letting them know it was down. However when I spoke with a manager about the situation and asked what they were doing to remedy things or to compensate guests, she made an offer that I felt was fair, which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.

Chipped, water damaged wood in the bathrooms.4. There is no restaurant and breakfast is minimal.5. Windows without a view, overlook, what I can only describe as a junk yard and views into other guest rooms. So had to kee p blinds down most of the time for privacy, which left the room without any natural light.6. Not enough lights in the rooms - very dark.7. Air conditioning was very noisy (huge, old floor units). 8. Location is great. Walking distance to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Macy's, Empire State Building, Central Park and other popular tourist attractions.9. Check-in and check-out was relatively straight forward.10.

Food at meals was generally not great - greasy sandwiches, wilted salad (one meal it was just lettuce ... really just lettuce), but let’s put that on my company versus the hotel - since our one dinner there featured a surprisingly perfectly cooked filet!I valet parked on arrival and - it turns out at $60+ a night ... ouch, even for NY... and was blessed with a small scratch on my car when it got delivered after a 30+ minute wait.

We waited the housekeepers to “clean” our room and they said we will call you when your room is ready. (Which they never did.) After 2 hours we FINALLY checked-in and we went to our room.

I stayed there for 6 nights and the Facility Fee was nearly $250. That then pushes the cost of the hotel into another price tier and it just doesn’t offer enough amenities to warrant being in that tier. After a conversation with Elizabeth and Nancy at the front desk they agreed to waive it. Thank you to them both. The good: when you take the fee out of the equation there is great value for the money here. The basic room is adequate size for 1-2 people with an average hotel size bathroom. It’s nothing noteworthy but it’s very reasonable for Manhattan at the price point (excluding the fee of course). There’s a lounge area and a gym but not a restaurant or much else in the way of amenities (for instance no in room fridge) but again compared to what other nearby hotels are charging, I’m ok with those not being there. The location is perfect for exploring midtown. A 10 minute walk will get you to Times Square, Columbus Circle, Central Park or 5th Ave. There’s a good mix of restaurants within walking distance, both in terms of price range and cuisine. Carnegie Hall, Broadway, Radio City are all within walking or short cab ride distance. Were it not for the Facility Fee I’d probably give them a 5 star rating but I’m taking a star off because when you factor in the cost of the fee, the amenities and size of the room are sorely lacking for what it ends up costing. No fee: 5 star. With fee: 3 star, so I’ve split the difference and given it a 4. ","Chapel Hill, NC",14,4.0

It’s far simpler to include them in the room rate, paid up front. I understand it’s not just this hotel, but all NYC hotels, but nevertheless it’s extremely irritating. Park Central did include some extras though, such as a discount at the hotel bar, which was nice. The fittings are in good condition, albeit somewhat dated. If I could point out something, it’s that the shower curtain in the bathroom was too short. We enjoyed our stay in a family room with 2 double beds. The staff were pleasant and friendly, and went out of their way to make our stay easier. There are no coffee and tea facilities in room, but there is a Starbucks on the ground floor, and the hotel lobby also has a small coffee shop. The best thing about our stay was location - Central Park is 5 minutes walk away, the major museums like the American Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are reasonably walkable distances away too.

It is very convenient to the Theater District.The property is an older property but has been very well maintained and it did not feel like an older property. The rooms were clean, quiet, and more than adequate.There is no on-site restaurant, but there are many restaurants within a block or two for breakfast or lunch.The Bar area is very upscale and comfortable. The bar hostess, Nancy, made us feel very much at-home and treated us like family. Meeting her was one of the highlights of our trip!The only real negative to the property is the elevator situation. At one time it appeared that this property had a total of 8 elevators, 4 for each side. There are now only two elevators per side. One side serves the higher floors, one the lower floors. This works OK when the elevators are all working. During our visit one of the two elevators serving our floors was out of service for about a day and a half. This caused major queues to access the remaining elevator.The outside of the building is also under some sort of refurbishment, so our outside view was somewhat blocked by scaffolding and safety screening. We were not in the room much so this was not a major issue.This was our third visit to NYC and our third hotel. If this hotel is available, we will likely stay here on our next trip!","Hudson Oaks, Texas",3,5.0

We had booked two rooms ideally adjoining or at least next door or opposite as we were travelling with our two daughters. Whilst I appreciate that these things cannot be guaranteed it was confirmed on our booking. When we arrived we was not even booked on the same floor. The hotel was fully booked and the best they could then offer was to move us to another floor but both rooms were king beds and meant my daughters sharing a bed. The lady checking us in was understanding and went to see a manager. Initially the response was well we don’t guarantee it but it was clear and then they showed us our agent who was far less helpful hadn’t actually even made the request. They offered to move us the following night into the rooms we had booked, whilst waiting only 10 minutes for our temporary rooms to be made ready they gave us complimentary drinks at the bar and vouchers for a breakfast in the morning and were really helpful.The hotel itself is lovely and it’s location is great for exploring the awesome NYC, we especially wanted to thank Nancy who oversaw the bar & took great care of us in the evenings especially our young daughter who she really looked after. We normally stay at a more expensive hotel when in NYC but this does all you need when visiting and will certainly get our business when we return.A great find.","Hadleigh, United Kingdom",25,5.0

The location was perfect for us - about 3 blocks south of Central Park and 6 blocks or so north of Times Square. There was an initial mix-up with the room.

Initially they put us in a handicapped room with a King bed and a pullout couch (and tried to convince us that this was just as good as two queens). This was remedied fairly quickly when I said I wanted the room that I had reserved. The beds were really comfortable and the bathroom was clean, but there was an odd smell in the room (like old socks) and the bathroom definitely smelled like mildew. The rooms were quiet, and overall we were satisfied. I have seen the reviews about ""surprise charges,"" but that wasn't our experience. I was advised at the time of the reservation, and by email on two different occasions thereafter (and before our arrival) about the ""facility fees.""

The hotel is very conveniently located across the street from Carnegie Hall, just south of Columbus Circle and Central Park South, and about 10 blocks north of Times Square.

The staff at the hotel has been excellent, and I especially want to acknowledge the expert assistance from front desk personnel Nancy and Darren, and the cheerful housekeeper named Kim. I also wanted to give an honorable mention to another housekeeper who turned in a set of Lincoln Center tickets that I had mistakenly left behind during a room change (complimentary upgrade)! What an unexpected relief it was to get those tickets back in time! This would be a 5-star rating but for the often poor elevator service. The hotel is host to many tour groups and large choruses visiting Carnegie Hall, and the elevators can get very backed up. One additional tip, get the $1.00/day breakfast option if it’s offered.

First of the location is a few blocks from Times Square and Central Park and the Subway entrance is literally 20-30 feet from the front door. Upon arrival we were able to checkin fairly quick ( less then 5 mins ) My room was upgraded one level up and we took our luggage upstairs. The room was king size bed. Very neat and contemporary style. Loved it!! The bathroom was a bit small but that kinda given when it comes to majority of NYC hotels. After staying there for a couple of nights we wanted to change the room because we were facing the 56th St with a office building across from us, I went down to get some bandaids from the front desk coz my girlfriend new shoes gave her blisters (Walking about 20,000 steps) I see a guy by the name Darren at the front desk, after getting the bandaids I brought up my request to him thinking he probably will tell me that he can't do anything blah blah and to my surprise he turned out to be manager and an awesome dude. Very professional yet very helpful. He said he can't guarantee anything but he did make all the necessary notes and suggested that I call the front desk in the AM. Which I precisely did that and than I was transferred to Guest Services, at this point I find myself speaking to another gentleman by the Quimby T. who's in charge of BRAND INTEGRATION AND GUEST EXPERIENCE ( BTW I grabbed his business card don't know what all that really means lol) He was very polite, professional and helpful as well. I was still skeptical until the point he said, I see all the notes made by the manager Darren. He said no worries. we want you to have a pleasant stay and put a room from us with a King size bed for tomorrow ( couldn't do anything for that day because all King Size bedrooms were booked ) on the 16th floor with partial views of Times Square. I was so impressed with the genuine urge to help a guest staying at their hotel. Also when I walked into my new room I can't help to notice a bottle of Champagne and couple of champagne glasses and some chocolate. They really didn't need to do that but the fact that went out of their way specially Quimby to make our stay even more pleasant I can't be appreciative enough. Bottom line is the location is just one of the best traits of staying at this hotel but they have truly exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay here on my next visit to NYC and recommend this hotel if any of you ever stay in NYC because I for sure am.

I was absolutely disgusted, and after speaking to front desk got moved to another room which was great. However my issue is that I’m not too pleased about the level of customer service provided. I think the hotel staff hide behind the exterior of “I work at this fancy hotel and you should appreciate being able to stay here” type of attitude. On the night of being moved to another room we had spoken to one of the managers at front desk, I believe his name is Darren and I told him that I was not happy about the cockroach, especially because I’d found it in the bathroom I felt that I couldn’t use any of my toiletries and replaced my toothbrush amongst other things. I explained to him that I felt it fair to have our room fees waived for the duration of our stay. He agreed almost instantly, told us it would be absolutely no problem and to me that was the end of that. Fast forward to the next morning, and I have an email from another manager summarising the events of the night before. The only difference is this new manager claimed that Darren only offered to waive room fees for 2 nights and not the remainder of our stay. When I replied to correct him he disagreed and stated that this was not the case. Even after going down to speak to him at the lobby it was as if he was explaining the conversation I had with Darren as if I had not been there. I even explained that as a business focused on customer services and hospitality they should honour the agreement originally made. However instead we had a manager speak to us in nothing but jargon and try to find a way to okay finding a cockroach in our room. I have to say I’m not happy with this. Especially as I felt that I was made out to look like a liar. What shocked me the most is how kind and helpful Darren was when I had spoken to him, only for him to tell the AM manager a completely different story. Aesthetically the hotel is gorgeous, however their customer service, and ability to keep to their word has a lot of improvement to be made.",,2,2.0

We were told it was quieter and would be better for our longer stay (8 nights). Not sure it the reason was true, but it was quiet, away from any stair wells and lifts and though our view was uninspiring (just looking in to a 'well' of other bedroom windows) we were not in the hotel much at all. So quiet...suited us very well. When there we just wanted to rest and sleep. Room was very comfortable and perfect for our need. The breakfast is from a small shop in the foyer if you choose. You can prepay for breakfast and collect from here but we did not include breakfast in our reservation and were glad. We were able to catch breakfast on the fly, depending where we were going and what we fancied. The shop had a good variety but when buying adhoc, it was expensive. So buying a croissant and tea outside the hotel from a little cafe was much cheaper than the shop in the foyer. I think they had the most expensive banana's anywhere!Hotel was great for us, we slept very well and the couple of occasions we used the hotel bar it was pleasant. Though we did encounter a waitress, who seemed to think an apathetic attitude still justified a 20% service tip.....having ignored us for over half an hour and not just once, I disagreed and she was not happy, but it did not taint our stay.

We were pleased to walk in to a beautiful lobby. Check in was fast and friendly. I wish I could remember the front desk associates name; she was so helpful and friendly! We needed two beds so we chose the Premium Corner Two Queen Room as it advertises higher floors 8th-18th, and would be an exterior room, with some kind of view. Initially during check in, we were informed that there was no guaranteed minimum 8th floor, but she would try and accommodate us. No problem as we were placed on the 11th floor, but this is a disconnect from what is advertised. The room was very nice; windows on two sides (corner room) with a decent view, bright and airy. The room wasn't wide but longer than a traditional room, with an easy chair and desk/chair, and was clean and comfortable! Just like the website photo. This hotel, located on 7th at 57th, is a couple of blocks from Central Park and a short walk to Times Square, Broadway theaters and many restaurants! When looking for hotels in Manhattan, just remember that the Avenues; 5th, 6th, 7th, Broadway, 8th, for example are very long blocks.

Our friendly concierge was very helpful for restaurants and subway directions, however, be aware the concierge is only available until around 6pm, so help with dinner has to be done beforehand! Upon departure, the doormen were helpful securing a cab, and helped us with our luggage. Additionally, you can store your luggage before check in and get started having fun and leave it there after checkout before you depart! Overall, this was a very nice hotel. Really, everything we hoped it would be! Hints: Use your mobile device for reservations to get the best rate! Be aware there is an approx. $30 facility fee per day. Sign up for The Guestbook and you will get the option of getting ""cash back"". Our credit card was credited in just two days after our stay! Great stay!!!","Houston, Tx.",20,5.0

The bathroom shower curtain smells terrible like it hasn’t been cleaned in years and needs to cleaned/replaced.

By far the worst experience I've had as a traveler. Three things: the place smells like weed, hotel staff is rude and hostile, and there's absolutely nothing in the room - yes even water. I checked into the hotel around 11:30 pm. The entire 11th floor smelled like weed. I thought the smell would get better in my room but the smell was no different. In fact, the smell of marijuana worsened throughout the night. Within 2 hours into my stay, at 2 am, I started having a really bad headache due to the smell and went to the front desk about this matter. The front desk gave me two options: clean the room or go to a different room. I requested housekeeping to clean the room because it was 2 am in the morning and I've had a long day due to flights/meetings. The housekeeper spoke to me in a very hostile and threatening manner as she entered the room. She said, ""The room doesn't smell. What are you talking about? Where do you want me to spray?"" Further, she sprayed the odorizer DIRECTLY on my pants as I was standing right next to it. It was an extremely unpleasant experience. I didn't expect this from a 4-Star hotel. I talked to Darren, the manager of Park Central hotel, about this incident. While he provided a waiver of the facility fees, this was NOT a 4-Star experience.

Reception staff rude, not willing to assist in anyway at all, all round lack of professionalism towards its guest. Booked a premier room at this property and the final outcome was a standard room, good start, and the continuous attitude from reception just made everything worse. Air-condition and heating system is non-existent in this property. Made a complaint about the cold and the hotel just provide me with a portable heater in the room, a heater that is from the 60s. Another complaint and again no response what so ever. ""This is what we have"" was the response. Again we go back to the professionalism of the property, just does not exist.Various amenities mentioned on the booking were not available in the room. Event the simplest of requirements in a floor towel in the bathroom. The various contacts with reception just pointless. Surprised that this property is still in existence and the star rating is well up for a review.Not sure it is worth discussing any other aspect of the room as it is well below the rating. Dated, in need of an update and requires a complete change in staff.Concierge, water of time. The concierge usually within the hotel chains is one of the most knowledgeable members of the team. This property offers concierges who know very little about the tourist sites and whether or not they are open or not. Was sent to an attraction, only to be informed it was closed based on the time of year and weather, is such not something a concierge should know.Give up. Will not visit this property again, simple.

The lobby and check-in experience were reminiscent of a Four Seasons, and seeing the flashing lights of Time Square down the street seemed almost too good to be true. Little did I know, however, that my first impressions of the hotel were not characteristic of my stay. Here is a list of things I felt took away from my New York vacation. Housekeeping: By far the worst housekeeping I've ever had in any hotel, ever! The rooms were clean enough--my person forgot to clean my restroom several times, but I can look past that. What I can't look past is having housekeeping staff outside my door every morning and every night loudly talking on their cell phones. My first morning, I was awoken by someone screaming ""SISTER, SISTER!"" Curious to what was going on, I peaked out my door only to discover a member of the housekeeping staff shouting on their phone. This happened on more than one occasion, with a different staff member each time. Other members of my party, who were staying in completely separate parts of the hotel also experienced this. This is an easy fix, and I hope this review changes that. Construction / Lack of Soundproofing: Be warned, the hotel is undergoing construction and is wrapped in scaffolding. The noise can be inconvenient to guests, especially considering that the windows of the hotel are nothing near soundproof. The walls are also paper thin, and I could often hear the conversations of my neighbors (and the hotel staff!) late into the night. Worst of all, the lack of soundproofing meant the rock band from the nearby club often made its way into my room--even at 1 am.Lack of Food: For a hotel that advertises itself as 4 Star, the universal expectation is that it has some sort of restaurant option for its guests, especially for breakfast; the Park Central, however, has none. Even Holiday Inns and other 3 star hotels have some sort of breakfast spread for their guests--it's not that hard! The only thing the Park Central has is its overly priced Central Market, where you can buy $12 mediocre grab-and-go sandwiches and $6 bottles of water. As a side note, a staff member informed me that I would be FINED if I brought in outside food to eat in their vast, empty seating area. Another staff member told me it was fine to being in outside food. Regardless of whoever was right, this is of evidence of a clear lack of communication between management and staff.The Elevators: This is the first time I've ever found fault with the elevators of a hotel. The Park Central's elevators are bizarre, inconvenient, and in need of repair. Namely, pressed-buttons don't light up, causing a sense of momentary anxiety as you wonder if your elevator will really stop at your floor. Additionally, the layout of the elevators is so confusing, that it really needs a map--somehow, the elevator directly outside my room took me the lobby of a different hotel? Most inconveniently, there is not nearly enough elevators for the size of the hotel. I would often wait 5 minutes for an elevator, only for it to be full. The moral of my stay: take the stairs! But this shouldn't have to be the case for handicapped people who don't have the option to take the stairs (or the time to wait 10 minutes for an elevator!) Overall, the Park Central Hotel has a great location and is affordable when compared to its competitors in the area. But considering that a night's sleep is nearly impossible, I wouldn't risk staying here.","Westlake Village, California",59,1.0

The staff was friendly and gave me a temporary room key so that I could use the restroom off of the lobby. We checked in our luggage and went about our day. We didn't return for hours. We had originally wanted two Queen beds but could only get a King Size. We asked about Queens but were told they were sold out. As we were standing there, one became available. The desk clerk seemed almost as happy about it as we were.If you need to get any work done, the lobby bar area is comfortable. The store downstairs has better prices on their coffee then the Starbucks next door.

Wow- Park Central looks amazing.Upon arriving we were very tired but again, excited.When we entered the ‘lobby’ it smelt incredible.. reminded me and of mother’s perfume. It was clean, gorgeous and very impressive. Reception are a little frosty- not mean, just not very smiley and we were told ‘stand in between the ropes’ (where you wait to be seen) check in was quick and we were on the 7th floor. Only two small lifts to our floor but no wait- quick and up to our room in no time. The room itself was next to the ice machine and behind the elevators - I’m a light sleeper, so instantly I said ‘ohhh, I hope this isn’t noisy’ :/..The room was big, had a comfortable bed, huge tv, small bathroom (but well lit and all you need- bath shower sink etc). We were very happy!We came back later that evening to relax after being out all day and we were tired! I had ear plugs from the flight and because the windows were not double glazing- you could hear the streets. It’s New York! However, we kept hearing this god awful sound that I thought was someone dragging a big table above us- turns out it was the lift whenever it went past our floor .. this was loud and did annoy me.

Because I am from New Jersey, and having worked in Manhattan, I know that New York is very pricey. I was so very happy to see that Park Central Hotel had an amazing nightly rate. I also knew that because of the rate charged, that the hotel would more than likely be less than stellar. This was absolutely NOT the case. I felt safe the minute I walked into the hotel each night - there is security at the door of the hotel and they take the time to discreetly recognize you. The staff (in all areas of the hotel: front desk, bar and lounge area, convenience store downstairs, maintenance and all those on the phone that I didn't have the pleasure to meet) were pleasant, professional and genuinely happy. The room was modern, clean, quiet - just everything I needed. The first night I wanted an additional blanket (I'm always cold) and I called the service number to ask for a blanket. Immediately, not one - but two warm blankets were delivered. I then received a call from someone in maintenance confirming that my blankets arrived. What???? Who does THAT anymore? The attention to detail is wonderful, especially the lovely lights which adorn the entrance to the hotel - this helped me recognize my hotel when I was returning in the evening. This hotel is a 10 insofar as customer service is concerned - especially since customer service seems to be less evident in these times.

First of all, this time the room had more synthetic pillows! Yay! I also felt that the elevator situation wasn't as bad as before, but maybe that's because I was on a top floor, so the elevator was always empty when it got to me. It appears they had just re-grouted the bathroom tile from the room I was staying in, because some of the stain from the black grout ran down the side of the shower when water was splashed on it. The bathroom door could use replacing for sure. In fact, in a small bathroom like that, it would be smart if the hotel went to using pocket doors! Now, in terms of complaints, I will say that the only reason I didn't rate this hotel higher has to do with their front desk. We encountered a few issues with our check in and reservation, and the attitude that the front desk took with me didn't help. They claimed that we didn't pay ahead of time for our group rooms, which we had proof of otherwise. On check out, we requested a late checkout for one member of our group who was sick, which they gave us, but again, there was definitely some attitude.

Its 10-15mins walk from Times Square and the shopping areas along Fifth Ave.The room was clean, and room/bathroom had reasonably modern décor and amenities, however there was a couple of things that dropped the experience a bit.First there was no luggage service that we were aware of – we hauled our luggage to our room ourselves and upon checking out brought the luggage down ourselves as well. There is a concierge so not sure if they offer this service or not.Second the lifts at this hotel area absysmally slow and inefficient. There’s no other way to put it. From what I understand, this is a large hotel (around 600-700 rooms) but there were only 2 lifts servicing the floors. Each day we’d have to pass up multiple lifts to get one that is suitably empty. (going down to lobby). This was only an issue in the mornings. In the evenings we got an empty lift first time each time, but they were still slow…Finally heating/cooling unit in the room was quite loud when it was on, it sounded like the motor was installed somewhere nearby which is what was audible rather than just loud passage of air.Other than that, this hotel wins on location and convenience and if you’re intending to be out and about the whole day and using the hotel just to sleep, it’s a suitable place to do just that.","Perth, Australia",29,4.0

Nancy then told us it must be a different hotel because were in the Park Kitchen and the Instagram picture said Park Lounge, the drinks menu in the bar had the words Park Lounge written on it. So either she just didn’t want to ask the guy behind the bar or clearly wanted to push something else on the menu.

We secured an early check in no problem. Check in took only took a few mins and the staff was very friendly and helpful the entire weekend. We grabbed a couple drinks in the lounge after bringing our things to the room. The 2 bartenders were awesome. Very friendly. But not cheap. But hey. It’s a NYC hotel near Times Square. Lol. The room was very nice. Looked line it had all been upgraded recently. Very clean except we did see some hairs in the shower that were not ours. Not a game changer since it was our only complaint. Great location. It was loud at night because of the construction going on all night across the street But the convenience of the location made up for it. A couple great bars right across the street.

There were just so many of us waiting and only 5 or 6 people fit at a time. Then we have the problem with the room not having heating. We spoke to guest services who told us the previous occupant didn’t want heating on and therefore they turned it off. Well I’m not the previous occupant. They supposedly turned the heating on but the room was still freezing so we slept with hand warmers in the bed so our teeth would stop shattering.

At check in we have a credit card to authorise incidentals, but I asked if I could pay on a different debit card at check out instead. The hotel receptionist said this isn't a problem and off we went.The last day, we awoke to invoice of having charged $325 USD before we'd checked out. I asked them to reverse it and charge the debit card, as agreed and requested, which they did. On my return home I have discovered they have charged the debit card the right amount but charged me $400 USD on my credit card. No response to emails or phonecalls.

The ONLY good thing I can say about this hotel is the location.... and thats literally it. My mom and I just visited New York from Jan 4-8 as a celebratory trip, and this hotel ruined our experience. We had been in touch with the hotel prior to our arrival, and we were ensured that the staff would do everything in their power to ensure a special visit. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a rude woman who each time we saw her she would hide her name tag so we never got her name despite speaking with her on several occasions (was working Jan 4 at 230pm). She had an attitude each time we saw her and seemed as though she despised her job.Upon reaching our room, we were immediately disappointed. The room itself was tiny, despite upgrading to the King room (I forget the specific name of the room), but for some reason had a long, strange hallway. The hotel faces itself, so everytime we looked outside we could only see other people in their rooms, including a couple that made us very uncomfortable as they would be intimate by the window. This resulted in us having to keep the window shut. Additionally, the thermostat needed a new battery, so we had to call down because the room was way too hot. We had to wait a long time for someone to come upstairs to replace the battery, despite being told he would be up, ""immediately"". He ended up opening our window to which it became way too cold, but whenever we would shut the window it was way too hot. Additionally, the sounds of New York (i.e., sirens, music, honking, etc) would keep us up.Additionally, we had requested extra towels, a coffee machine and fridge upon avail... none of which was presented. Two days in a row (Jan 6 & 7), we were woken up at 6:00am on the dot by the alarm on the end table despite us never touching it. We suspect that when it was cleaned something was hit by mistake. Both days we were up late the night before, and after it went off we were unable to fall back asleep. Completely exhausted us. When room service came they did not replace the soap or hand towels. We asked for hand towels and were told, ""there were no more"" and that, ""once the next load of laundry was complete, we would receive them"" (we were on the 16th floor and this was at 9am....?). So, we went out for the day and returned in the early evening and still did not have towels or soap. The little cafe or whatever it's officially classified as in the hotel lobby is extremely overpriced, and the staff there are extremely rude as well. The woman working there (again, didn't catch her name but she works the morning shift and has should length strawberry blonde hair), just like the woman at the front desk, makes it extremely evident that she hates her job. She literally rolled her eyes at people and maintained an extremely rude attitude. There were two groups of children who were running around the lobby and each floor (they would take the elevator down one floor at a time) who were screaming and laughing late at night, holding up the elevators and waking people up. The lobby also had many people who were not staying at the hotel, some of which creeped my mom and I out. For a contrasting point of reference, I have stayed at the Sheraton one block down who always have staff and security members in the lobby. On multiple occasions I have walked past them politely, maturely, professionally and respectfully asking people to leave. It always made me feel much safer staying there. The bathrooms in the lobby are also always filled with people who are not staying at the hotel waiting to use the bathroom. I have never witnessed this being an issue at any other hotel in New York. For another point of reference, the Millennium at Times Square will not even let you approach the elevators unless you present your room key (or they recognize you). This hotel did not present adequate procedures as such. Anyone can walk in at any time in the lobby and hang out for as long as they wish. As if this wasn't enough, the elevators are also ridiculous. There are only two in the lobby, and the wait time for one to come would sometimes be up to 10 minutes long. They are also so tiny that once an elevator finally came, you couldn't squeeze in. Not only that, but the elevator would stop at every single floor despite there being no room for someone to fit on. So, you wait ten minutes for an elevator to come, and once it comes you most likely can't fit on. If you can, it takes another 5-10 minutes to finally reach the lobby because it stops at every single floor with disappointed people. Each time we were in the elevator (10+ times a day), people were ALWAYS complaining. I've never seen such tiny, poorly operated elevators in a hotel in my entire life.... and we were only on the 16th floor... I can only image how much more frustrating it was for people higher up.There are many more reasons, but this review is long enough. Do NOT stay at this hotel- you will just be frustrated and disappointed. There are countless hotel options in New York in every area, choose another.",,1,1.0

So, we arrived at 2pm and waiting in a crazy line to check in. Only to be told to come back at 4 and leave our luggage. Well, the luggage like was also very long so my husband and I went to the bar. About an hour or so into our wait someone told us to give the front desk our phone number and they’ll call when our room is ready. I wish they had told us that when we first checked in, but I went back up and did it again. About 15 minutes later I noticed people getting keys and heading for the elevators. So I went back to the front desk just to check. Turns out our room was ready...but we did not get a call or text. We went to the room to drop our stuff and meet up with the family. The problem with the staff telling everyone to come back at 4 means there are now lines for the elevators...Other than that debacle the room was fine and clean just for one night.

The man who helped us check in, couldn't be more awful. He was so rude and dismissive. We were there at 3:30. He said your room won't be ready until 4. He was still able to check us in, and took the credit card info. But once that was done, he just stopped talking to us. We observed others coming in and going to a desk to get door keys so we figured that is what we would need to do at 4pm.We opted to store our bags so we could get coffee after a day of traveling. This is an amenity that you pay $35/night plus tax for. A man standing at a different desk literally takes your bag and throws it into a room 2 steps behind a door. When we came back a little after 4 to get our room keys we picked up our bags. The attendant literally said ""I would like a tip"". I wasn't happy with that as $35/night is excessive and the only 'amenity ' we would even use would be the bag store service. Not the attendant's fault for the hotel policy. However, the attendant didn't do anything to get the tip. If I could get my own bag from behind the door, I would have. Its not like they put them on carts or carried them for us. Nothing to me that was 'tippable'. And I'm typically a generous tipper. Elevators always seemed congested. We often had to wait more than 5 minutes, mostly less than 10 minutes for an elevator. We were on the 10th floor. Our housekeeper/maid Mariska or Marisha was the nicest person we met from NYC. She was so welcoming and helpful, and so positively happy with each encounter. We left a tip the first day and requested some extra towels. She delivered wonderfully. Talking about tipping, I do feel bad we didn't leave a tip the 2nd night. Our Lyft came a lot quicker than expected - within a minute and we knew the elevator situation so we grabbed our bags and flew down 10 flights of stairs to catch the Lyft. In the shuffle we forgot to leave money for her.The restrooms on the ground floor are clean. The lobby shop has a good selection but closes early. It is a great location to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. Small rooms. I was in a room with 2 queen beds. Overlooked an alley. Could hear the garbage trucks, horns, etc all night. Even 10 floors up. If we were to go back, I think I would try to find a nicer hotel. Again, the housekeeper was great, and the nicest person. ","Canandaigua, New York",16,3.0

My family and some friends checked in several days early to enjoy the city before the rest of the tour came in even though there were several large groups check-in was painless we didn't have adjacent rooms like we agree quested but when we got to our room and had some issues with the view asI had an elderly person who was going to be staying in the room most of the week so she could have a better View and we were accommodated immediately. Staff at the front desk also made arrangements so that we would not need to change rooms when our tour group arrived. Due to health issues we were accommodated with a fan, a mini fridge, and coffee maker we even got a call making sure we got let me ask for and if we were satisfied. We cannot say more about the staff from the minute we checked in we were able to leave our bags and had a recommendation for a place to eat nearby from the Bellman and also a great recommendation as to where to stand for the Thanksgiving Day Parade viewing. I cannot give enough praise to Quimby in customer service he always greeted me everyday and inquired about my day activities when we came back from the Thanksgiving Day Parade Frozen he greeted us with offers of hot coffee or a bottle of water. Such a very kind man representing that property amazingly well he also told me the history of the hotel and what famous people used to stay there it was very interesting. Carmelo (I have misplaced his card) the doorman was wonderful. We became friendly also and I looked forward to seeing him and visiting with him even though I generally used Uber he still helped me watch for my car He did give us help and tips regarding the cabs as we did Dean ever use them a few times also. Several days I traveled solo he would always say make sure if I'm working you check back in with me so I know you're okay. They both made me feel like I was almost family for them. I would pick this hotel again just because of the level of service that they displayed. It's an excellent location very walkable to many of the areas people want to do in New York City. Have a wonderful Premier Deli across the street with excellent food and a block and a half down Applejack Diner and McGee's Pub were wonderful recommendations all by the staff. I feel I left friends at this hotel I hope to return to the city. Our room was large the bed was extremely comfortable. The only issue we had is it could use some brighter lighting. We did request an additional floor lamp and it was brought in so my elderly friend could read. if you're looking for locations close to Central Park it's very close and Time Squares about a ten-minute walk very safe area to explore and enjoy the neighborhood.

Arriving to a less than warm greeting where we were told we had already checked in at 10:30am (we were at 41,000 feet and over the Atlantic at this time so check in would have been difficult) this confusion took 20 minutes to sort and was largely the colleague at the desk frowning at the screen in complete silence with a couple of “Card Please” and “Name Please” thrown in for good measure. The room itself was great, a nice big bed, really clean and a lovely view of the Xmas shop on the street below. A little bit noisy but you don’t book New York for a quiet getaway. The bar was also a great chill out spot for us too.Back to the staff at the hotel though.....I spoke to a guest relations about how I was planning to propose to my girlfriend and could she recommend any nice restaurants to celebrate. “No, you’ll have to speak to concierge was what I had as a reply and we actually counted in passing how many times this lady actually smiled when passing (It was zero) In comparison the concierge shook my hand, congratulated me and took the time to tell me about all of his favourite spots.We also went to ask about the hotel facilities but noticed the person at the counter was actually shopping for dresses on our way out of the bar which must have been why she didn’t make eye contact or acknowledge us to the point where we walked away.On checkout we had our bill posted under the door at 6am with some lovely additional charges from the person who had been checked in under our name in error. These were removed after we proved we weren’t even at the hotel at the time.So the common theme was the service here. The hotel is really nice and in a great location. A handful of the staff clearly love their jobs and work hard to reflect well on the hotel. The rest of the people we encountered didn’t represent the hotel well at all and left me feeling annoyed on more than one occasion.","Woolsington, United Kingdom",5,2.0

Nearby restaurants - Applejack Diner which is good for breakfast, and Serafina - good Italian, both about 2 blocks from hotel. (Hotel does not have a restaurant. There is a place to purchase coffee, muffins, pastry, fruit, small snack items, but we found it expensive. (2 medium lattes and 2 muffins were almost $20. You then can then take it to the bar area to eat.)Our initial room was a king room (1408) and the light in the bathroom mirror was so dim, you could really not see well. There was no chair in the room and it was tight between end of bed and dresser. We called for maintenance concerning the dim light, and they said this particular room had “different bulbs” in the bathroom mirror than most of the other rooms and nothing could be done. After speaking to guest relations, we were able to move to another room 3 doors down. This room was larger, had a chair, a well-lit bathroom BUT, was very hot and stuffy, even though we turned the temp down. Maintenance was called to this room and they explained due to age of building, they either had to have air conditioning or heat on, but could not switch back and forth; and since it was now winter, heat had been turned on, so only way to cool the room was to open a window. (A little noisy, but we did this to cool off the room.) Totally understand that this is because of age of the building, but just something to keep in mind.

The ladies at the desk were delightful, informative, and genuine as well as quick which was very much appreciated! Making our way up to the room, the halls seem a little narrow, but then you open the door to a large room which, compared to other places we have stayed, was a pleasant and welcome surprise! Comfortable and clean it lends to an air of quiet ambiance (of course if you listen closely you will remember what a busy area of a major city you are in)but that can'tbe helped. There are so many choices to get a bite to eat, and as for an adult beverage...I suggest the lounge! Perfectly mixed cocktails and a relaxed yet sophisticated feel! The next day sealed our Platinum stamp of approval. Check out was simple and easy, however, we needed to have our bags held for a couple of hours while we took an early afternoon stroll to the Central Park Zoo and surrounding park. Not only was it not an issue, Quimby Hightower made it a delight! He gave us his card for our bags stating that it isn't an issue at all and when we returned had a Park Central Hotel tote full of goodies for the ride home and a balloon, and presented it to our little guy for his birthday!

Moreover, throughout my entire stay at this terrific hotel, I was always in such a very good mood and I attribute this at least in part to a most welcoming hotel staff. Obviously, this hotel is located in one of the best New York City zip codes, which undeniably is the main attraction for booking a reservation. However, there are other good reasons as well to stay at the “Park Central Hotel”, which include: the hotel is extremely well run, immaculately clean and the daily room rates generally do not fluctuate much in comparison to other NYC hotels’ daily room charges. Although this hotel is very busy with over 900 guest hotel rooms, not once did I ever encounter a problem with hotel management when requesting to extend my stay and I did this at least several times while I was a guest. The hotel lobby is quite grand and has a lounge area that includes a huge bar with lots of banquet seating and where seasoned bartenders make excellent mixed drinks. However, there is no restaurant at this hotel but it is easy to order in food from several nearby restaurants. Also in the hotel lobby is an excellent coffee/pastry shop with very fresh daily selections. The coffees offered are all excellent and Gina who works there has to be one of the nicest people you will ever encounter. In addition to this, the hotel reception staff all are completely organized and sincerely friendly. I did want to specifically mention Angela as she made certain that my check in went smoothly and that any special requests I had were met. She was as perfectly pleasing as possible and this is an employee who obviously excels at customer service. In summation: The Park Central Hotel is an excellent yet less expensive hotel in comparison to other nearby hotels that are all in a prime NYC location and is an ideal choice to stay at. Many of the guests staying there that I spoke with indicated to me that they felt the same sentiments as I did and absolutely enjoyed the overall experience of being a patron at a hotel that knows exactly how to treat all their guests in a most special way. I highly recommend this hotel inasmuch as staying there made me feel as if I had escaped the busy outside city life in exchange for the serenity that awaited me inside at the very special “Park Central Hotel”! Thanks again to the entire hotel staff for making my stay most enjoyable. Jeff M.","New York City, New York",38,5.0

It’s a nice hotel – with a strange setup. There’s no restaurant and consequently no room service either. This I have no problem with – generally speaking Id rather go out anyway and for some reason or another, hotel breakfasts in the USA are notoriously bad. Never quite figured out why – but rarely is it worth the money or the bother. The room we had was large with two double beds – in New York hotels rooms are not large in general. This was perfect. Either you could face inwards – with 5 meters to the next building/window – or outwards towards Carnegie hall, with the noise from the street as an added bonus. Again – this is New York, so it should come to no surprise to anyone. Only two elevators served our floor – and since the hotel was pretty full – at times you could expect to queue up for elevators. All in all I liked the hotel – there’s always a but, there were a few things I did not like. Some of the staff was great – in particular the concierge, the doorman getting taxis was absolutely great (didn’t catch his name) and the assistant manager who assisted me when we had a check out problem with the credit card charges. But the check-in and check-out staff were at best not interested, at worst rude. And not New York arrogant – I mean rude. Strange that the front desk from left to right can be so different. Our wedding anniversary was during our visit, so I picked up flowers – but the hotel could not offer up a vase – not in any shape or form. For what is supposedly a first class hotel - that’s a first for me. And the final part that I did not appreciate – although I liked the room size – it was far from clean. Im not particularly sensitive, but when I see the sense in going to buy a box of Clorox to wipe down the surfaces you get the picture. Picked up old bottle tops from the floor underneath the desk, etc. You get the picture – it just generally did not feel clean and wasn’t either from the look of the used Clorox wipes. That is certainly not acceptable. Will we be back – perhaps. At the right price … sure. At the price we paid this time around, no.","Hollviken, Sweden",68,3.0

We stayed Nov 5-10 and the hotel was super nice, clean and well maintained. Yes there is no coffee maker, microwave or fridge but I think u can get that if requested but why would you want to since everything is so close to the hotel you can get coffee downstairs, across the street, next door or two doors down (Starbucks). And yes there is no restaurant but once again, so many great choices so close to you. Go out and explore. The hotels location is perfect, far enough out of Times Square to get away from the crowd but close enough you can be there in a few mins. Central Park, broadway and 5th ave are only a few mins away, and also subway stations super close (and super easy to use). The beds are so comfortable and the rooms are much more spacious than lots of other hotels we looked at that were more expensive than the Park Central. Even though a lot of reviews say upgrade to get a room on a higher level to get a quieter room and a view, you don’t need to, my husband and I booked the classic king room and we ended up on the 6th floor and it was perfect, you could hear a bit of noise outside but we had the fan on our heating/cooling system on and it was perfect. My parents booked a classic king room as well and ended up on the 5th floor and they had no complaints either. And if you book higher for a view I don’t think you would get much a view cause you are surrounded by taller buildings. Don’t trust a lot of those negative reviews, I am a very picky person when it comes to where I stay and this hotel met my high standards.

Housekeeping did a good job, they cleaned daily. However upon arrival when inspecting the bathroom there is some sort of something on the walls that doesn’t look like there has ever been any attempt to clean it off. We stayed for 8 nights, on night 2 we reported that our room phone wasn’t working and nothing was done about it. On day 3 we reported the phone again and nothing was done about it. The night before the Marathon my husband tried to call reception to request a wake up call and AGAIN the phone still wasn’t working. Numerous times we had to go looking for housekeeping to advise them they could make up our room because the phone wasn’t working and we couldn’t call them.Finally my husband for a 4th time went and requested for someone to fix the phone and it was suggested by the guest relations staff that we didn’t know how to use a phone and that it wasn’t broken and it was user error. This time they sent a lovely gentleman to come to the room to look at the phone, he was lovely, we’ll mannered and took a lot of pride in his work. This man is the kind of person they are luck to have working for them. He ascertain that the phone was unplugged at the back and that the handset needed a new battery. He fixed it quickly and but it would have been nice if it was fixed when it was first reported, it was a big inconvenience in our stay.Would I stay here again, no and my suggestion to others is factor in the “facility fees” to your budget as the faculty fee plus costs to stay at this hotel you might be able to find somewhere that doesn’t have the fee for the same price.Please note that all issues were raised with Guest Relations who committed to responding however at the time of writing this review upon checking out no response has been provided.

We were in line for at least 15 min while the bellman went into the back room to track down a package for someone in front of us. Frustrating. Our room was good. We had a premier double queen room on the 14th floor. We overlooked the backside of the hotel, which was actually great because I think it was quieter. The room was clean and decent size. We had 3 suitcases and no issue storing things in drawers or even just in suitcases on the floor/bench. Decent closet space and there is a safe for securing valuables. One issue was AC. It was really hot in our room. We took to opening the window while we were out so it would cool down and we set the thermostat really low. It wasn't a huge deal because it's November, but I can imagine that being an issue in hotter months. Excellent location! We were a couple blocks from Central Park and about a 10 min walk to Times Square. I was not pleased about the $35 ""resort fee"", but it's not uncommon among the NYC hotels. We just didn't use many of the services that this supposedly paid for.","Chantilly, VA",22,4.0

The only fault with the rooms is that the lighting wasn't great. The bathroom was very bright but the room itself was very dim at night.

The class took place in the hotel bar and was hosted by their mixologist Jason, who was very professional and personable. We learned to make three delicious whiskey cocktails. I usually prefer gin or vodka cocktails, but the drinks definitely wowed me - our group agreed that the sage blood-orange one was hands down the best one. As someone who's never tried making cocktails beyond simple mixers, it was really satisfying making drinks that tasted like something I'd pay $20 for at a bar. More than that, it was such a fun way to spend an afternoon with friends (even our NYC native friend was impressed). We were shocked that the class was only $45, considering all the drinks and the charcuterie plates they brought out for us as well. A class like this could easily go for $100+ in LA.

The lift access is dreadfully slow and insufficient in comparison to room and guest members.My big issue with the hotel is that despite them issuing a final invoice for the agreed value for my stay I'm still yet to receive a refund of my $200 deposit for incidentals. Be very aware of this. it's not particularly clear at booking that this is required, but you get stumped for it when you check in. also consider that this may be a reasonably sized chunk of your spend budget if you go with X amount of USD to spend. also if you're visiting from outside the US be aware that they advise in their small print it can take up to 30 days to get this back. this in my view is complete rubbish as after speaking with both my card provider and MasterCard they suggest a refund should be much quicker. I've written several times, and have just been fobbed of with '30 days'. I'm now at 27 days and nothing, and I hold no hope for it turning up, so the inconvenience of having to persue a chargeback seems likely. all in all not fussed on this place and feel we could have done better for the money. can't recommend.","Trowbridge, United Kingdom",5,2.0

I visited the hotel website & struggled to find any mention of this charge, but eventually found the information in the FAQ section, which reads: 'WHAT IS THE FACILITIES FEE?The mandatory Facilities Fee of $35 plus tax per room per night provides guests with the following amenities: - Unlimited Local and Domestic Long Distance Calls - Unlimited use of the 24-hour state-of-the-art Fitness Center - Luggage storage on arrival and/or departure up until 9:00 PM - Apple workstations with printing, faxing and scanning offered through our Guest Relations Team - 10% off your experience at our lobby bar Park Lounge - 1 hour free bike rental with 1 hour purchase from our partner Fancy Apple, showing your room key.**Please note, the facilities fee is not inclusive of service gratuities.'So there you go, We are now preparing to pay an additional sum of $140 (plus tax) at the end of our stay for facilities which we will not be using (apart from possibly having to store our luggage before our departure - $140 (plus tax) for that seems a bit steep!) Quite why establishments insist on doing this is beyond me, as there is clear evidence from previous reviews that all it does is create 'a bad taste' and deter guests from making a return visit. If you must charge people for facilities they don't use, then bury it in the room rate - ignorance is bliss, as they say. Better still, charge guests for what they use, when they use it.Anyway, let's see how the visit goes in December & I'll return with an update on our stay. Perhaps the hotel will redeem itself - it will have to do well to convince me that I haven't been ripped off.","Sunderland, United Kingdom",2,3.0

If you’re not familiar with NYC, it’s a fabulous location - easy walk to Broadway, Central Park, west side, east side, etc. the lobby is lovely - bright and inviting. Contrary to a few negative reviews, I found all of the staff helpful and friendly. I had booked in advance for the rate that included the possibility of cancelling. 3 days before, when I knew I wouldn’t need to cancel, I changed to a non-refundable rate for a significant savings and got a larger room. In fact, a nice sized room for NY, street view and higher level. Street noise and hallway noise were all acceptable.Now the negative and why I won’t return. As stated on other reviews, the room doesn’t feel clean. While the bed was clean and comfortable, the room felt musty and the bathroom had an odor. At first I thought maybe it was the plumbing, but I think it might have been dirty rags. Management needs to have the carpets cleaned well. There is what looks like dust on the floor by all of the walls. Also, it is strange that there is only one heavy, opaque window shade. With office buildings directly across the street, that means that the shade must be kept completely closed for privacy if you’re light is on Most hotels have an additional curtain or shade that allows light to come in, but can be closed so people can’t look in.It was also surprising that the lovely, large bar off of the lobby doesn’t serve any food at all. However, there is a small take out cafe, but closes early.The elevator security is misleading. As long as one person uses a key to make the elevator work, you can go to any floor. At most hotels with an elevator key slot, a key is needed to get to each specific floor.Location - perfectStaff - responsive Noise level - good for NYRoom size - good for NYRoom cleanliness - needs improvement ",St louis MO,62,3.0

We came here last month and it still sticks out as a sore thumb in my memory. It is a lie to call this a 4 star hotel.Issue 1: Facilities FeeThis ridiculous policy they have of $35 plus tax PER DAY ""facilities fee"" which covers the gym and concierge and newspapers - all the things that should come as part of a decent hotel anyway without extra charges. I don't understand why it's not already part of the room rate. We definitely didn't know about this prior to checking in. Is it so they can keep a lower rate on search engines and then spring the fee on unsuspecting guests? We took up issue with this and spoke to the manager, who was very rude and said that it's a standard practice in all New York hotels. Having stayed in New York hotels many times before, we knew this was a complete lie. Her rudeness and dishonesty, coupled with this unreasonable policy, were an awful way to start our stay.Issue 2: HousekeepingThe housekeeping is abysmal. Every single day we had a different standard of housekeeping. Once our towels were taken and not replaced. I had to call and ask for new towels. Another time, the housekeeper knocked the door and actually asked me to bring our garbage to the door for her. What kind of housekeeping standard is this? Ridiculous.Also they do not have any slippers and bathrobes at all. I have never been even in a 3 star hotel that refuses to provide these basic comfort items for guests.Issue 3: FacilitiesThis is an old hotel and even though attempts have been made to modernise it, you can still see the upkeep is poor. The window shades in our room were blackened and tattered on one side. There are stains all over the walls, especially in the bathroom. The hallway carpeting looks old and tired and there are even glasses left all over the floor by housekeeping I presume. It is not a pretty sight. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything your neighbours are saying and doing. The elevators take forever, be prepared to spend 10 minutes waiting each time you need to go up or down. There are also no mini fridges or coffee machines in the rooms. What are the facilities fees paying for if these guests still have all these inconveniences?Issue 4: Staff AttitudeAs mentioned above, the manager's response to us was unacceptably unprofessional and housekeeping is pretty bad too (see the staff asking me to carry garbage to her for her own convenience). We also needed to pick up a package and we were told that we could pick up from the concierge 24/7. So we got back around 11pm and asked for our package and then we were told the package room had already closed and we had to wait til the next day. Why were we being told different things by different staff?The only thing I liked about this hotel was the seating in the lobby. It's a nice place to sit and have breakfast or meet with people. However this one aspect is not enough to redeem all of the others that went wrong.The location is also rather undesirable, it's located in what feels like tourist central with food carts immediately outside the door and homeless people on the corners. Some might like this environment because it's close to other tourist hotspots but I did not.In conclusion, do not waste your money on this hotel. There are much better experiences to be had at many other NYC hotels and there's no reason why guests should put up with all of the issues I listed above.",,4,1.0

To be more specific: common four letters starting the last name. How about having someone who might actually pick up the phone, instead of minutes of numbers to push to try to do do it yourself?3. Something not easily fixed: the incredibly narrow elevators!4. Maybe if you can get this hotel at $200, it's a good deal, but we paid $300+, and then, we get hit with this ridiculous $40 or so ""facility fee"" which did nothing for us.

The off-site Reservationist mentioned a rate stipulation that was not referenced anywhere on the website. Repeated attempts to explain my point got me nowhere. I decided to contact the hotel directly and had the pleasure of speaking with Tony Cunaj, Complex Director of Reservations. He actively listened to my comments, graciously took time to straighten things out and made the reservation for me. I so appreciate Tony's assistance.

It's nice. It's clean. It's actually quiet - at least on the 11th floor. It's as tourist central as it gets. A place to lay your head and then get out and go. Next to zero amenities for most. Example, no coffee in rooms (must request a pot), no 'real' housekeeping, no room service, no food, and for me, no real concierge service. My room had a faulty bathtub and a missing closet door (I would've never noticed the door - but the maintenance folks noticed when they fixed the bath - no complaints there. Tom was great).None of this is a deal breaker, but when my rate to stay longer due to an extension of meetings went from 400 per night to 1,000 per night, I skipped on out to a new location. It was mainly just odd. Never saw a bellman - just a doorman to hail a cab, never had a cleaned room - meaning, they make the bed and empty trash. NOTHING ELSE. Not a wipe down, not a straighten up, nothing. I never even had food I'd had delivered (no food in the hotel) removed. It was always just left on the desk (no trashcans big enough to place containers in)... I'm no slob, but I think stacked disposable dishware and empty water bottles/juice/ in room glasses would be an obvious thing to remove? Maybe not. I asked the concierge about recommendations to book me for a massage. He informed me he could 'google some places in the area"" - no thanks, I have the googles on my own phone. They do allow delivery of food. You can go down to the lobby to meet the delivery driver. I had no use for 10% off of a hotel bar (it's like the heart of the city right here), and I had no need for a gym, There's no pool or 'amenities' other than a 'business center' - but that 40.00 'resort fee' they charged was still front and center. Trust me, if you can buy in the same price range elsewhere, I would. You are only paying for location, not another thing. And 400 plus a night is a LOT for a bed. It's a 3 star hotel - but pretty - hence the rating. I requested a room with a view - and I got it - as I was told - of the building across the street. Fun watching people work! The photos show rooms with views - but I don't know that is the truth... I prob won't be back, but I guess my expectations of paying premium for premium services are too high. Pretty disappointing, but nothing to remove stars about. Simply having a few things that make visitors stay a bit pleasant and not 'work' to do anything hotel related would change it up a lot!","Little Rock, Arkansas, United States",26,3.0

I found a pretty decent deal through expedia.ca and booked with Park Central based on the location and pretty good reviews regarding their customer service. It was just okay overall. The room was cleaned daily and replenished with fresh towels, which was nice but I wouldnt say they were deep cleaned, even upon arrival. Dust in the corners, left over hair in the shower, etc. The cards for the rooms are frustrating and do not often work properly...I had made it clear we were celebrating our recent wedding and were told we would be ""taken care of"" in terms of a nice room but that didnt happen...we ended up with a room with two double beds :S so confusing. Nothing else was done, not even a congratulations at check in.They also have a VERY steep daily fee, so expect a large bill at the end of your stay. I had been aware of this but for the dated nature of the hotel, the issues with the room keys, etc. 10% off at the hotel bar isn't exactly worth it. They charge resort fees in vegas but that is because they all have pools, etc. That being said the location is excellent, a few blocks from Central Park and Times Square. Would I recommend it? maybe, for location if you get a good deal.Would I book again? probably not, would rather pay a bit more for an initial cost at a more modern place with no hidden fees.",,4,3.0

For comparison only, I usually stay in places like the Lotte NY Palace or one of the Kimpton branded hotels. I chose this hotel as it was close to a conference site and NYC was incredibly booked up that night so there wasn't much available. I booked and paid for the room in advance to save a little since the rooms were so expensive ($550/night plus taxes which took it to over $625). That being said, the hotel was a lovely surprise. Large, modern-decor lobby and swift check-in. I liked that you needed your room key to access the elevator. I asked for a quiet room and got just that. Yes, it did face an interior courtyard area and all I saw was a brick wall in the distance but hey, it was only for one night. It was blissfully quiet which is always a plus in NYC. The room was modern and clean and the bed was incredibly comfy. Large TV, enough conveniently placed plugs for charging and well lit. Was it worth that large sum of money? Not sure but I think I caught NYC on a particularly bad Wednesday night so I was grateful to get a room. It is convenient if you want to hang in that part of town and there was a Starbucks just steps from the front door. Yay. Would I consider it again? You bet.","Wilton, Connecticut",103,5.0

Certainly not what we expected for the price we paid. I immediately called reception & asked if we could move to a room without an interconnecting door, I was told the concierge would come up & take us to another room.We sat there for 45 minutes & no one came so I called again, this time they said that they would get the manger to call me ""right back"" Meanwhile our friends were waiting downstairs so we could go out as we'd had nothing to eat since we'd landed. Another 20 minutes go by so I called again, this time I was eventually put through to the 'manager' I explained that this was the third call to reception with regards the room & she said she knew nothing about it ? I tried to explain the issues but she butted in to say there was nothing she could do as they had no other rooms available. When I asked why I had been told on the first call that the concierge would come up to move us she said they couldn't have done that as they were finished for the night ! She said the best she could do was move us to a 'deluxe' room the following day so we couldn't unpack & eventually left to find a restaurant 1 1/2 hours later than we could have done had we been told this in the first place.We did get moved the folllowing day & this room (652) was far better but not really what I expected for the price. Oh & the toilet seat was cracked in this room & the heaters in all 3 rooms did not seem to work. We then found on the second night the bar closed at 11.30pm, the 4th night it was closed completely for a private function & the day we left it was not open while we waited for our airport transfer ( between 1pm & 3pm) There is a little shop that sells very limited food, drink & coffee but that's it. No idea how they get 4 stars. No kettles in the rooms, no fridge ( unless you ask for one ) not even a bottle of water. As other guests have said the facilities fee of $35 / night is ridiculous & should be included in the price as it is compulsory. We had no use for anything it offered ( apart from luggage storage which most hotels offer for free ) & it didn't even include the wifi ? To recap, we found the staff on reception unfriendly & unhelpful, rooms with interconnecting doors could be very noisy, poor facilities for the price, a bar that's not open very late or not at all, standard room very poor, deluxe room just ok, nothing special or deluxe about it.The location was the only thing really going for it, 3 blocks from Central Park & 10 mins walk to Times Square.

Only downsides were that there was no basic coffee of tea facilities in the room so there’s no morning tea in bed option (no doubt to encourage you to go downstairs and buy a coffee).

She was very accommodating to us, as some times we had to sleep in after a long day exploring the city the day before. She was so sweet, and came back at another time to service the room. When we returned to our room at night, the beds were always made to perfection, with clean fresh sheets, and we never had to use the same towel twice. So a big Thank you to Mesina for looking after us. Also to Ally, Don, Quimbl for treating us with such kindness, it was our first time in NYC and you all made it one of the best holiday ever. So thank you to all. I cannot fault the staff, the hotel, and the location. We were close to everything. The hotel is located minutes from Central park, its also close to times Square - we could see it partially from out hotel room.

On November 4th, 1928, Arnold Rothstein walked into the Park Central’s front door and few hours later he spilled out of the service entrance with a bullet in his gut. 29 years later, the Park Central would see blood again, but this time in its barbershop. October 25, 1957, Albert Anastasia strutted into Grasso’s Barber shop in The Park Central Hotel. The mobster took a barber chair with his back facing the door. The attack was a classic mob hit. Two identically dressed gunmen hidden beneath aviator sunglasses, fedoras, and scarves wrapped around their faces walked into the hotel lobby. A wheelman and lookout in the lobby were waiting for them outside. Five bullets tore into the mafia chieftain. The police never apprehended the mob hitmen and the crime remains unsolved. The barbershop is now, like everything else, a StarBucks.The rooms are nice. The old bathroom means the door doesn't open all the way, instead hits the toilet before even halfway open. The seat has a big crack in it after everybody hits it with the door over and over. Every day when I returned to the room at 4:30, the maid had not cleaned yet. Rather than have to leave for an hour while she cleaned, I called the front desk and told them no need for towels and making the bed, etc. This continued 3 days in a row. Then I got a message that I must allow cleaning or the management will be forced to open the door to inspect. I guess I understand, after all. the Vegas bomber refused service for days, but it was the late cleaning every day that upset me.

The hotel is surrounded by places to eat/bars/shops. It is right in the heart of New York. You can see Times Square when you step out the door and Central Park is a 5 minute walk in the other direction. On arrival, our bags were taken to the room by staff and they told us if we needed anything, to call to reception. I found that this was very slow and we ended up spending the first night without a cot for our baby, even though I had sent an email in advance to confirm that this would be in the room, as were arriving late. Our room didn’t have enough towels for the family and we had to call to reception again! The beds were comfortable but the duvets had no covers and were instead put between two sheets. The room was extremely muggy and unpleasant, as the air conditioning was incredibly weak and made a loud noise when turned on. The bathroom has absolutely no ventilation so the mirror gets all steamed up and this contributes the humidity in the room.In general, the hotel is perfectly located but the hotel itself could be better!

Amazingly, the Westhouse exceeded my already high expectations. Upon being dropped off at the main entrance, my wife and I were promptly greeted by a team of doormen. What I immediately noticed, and then what I discovered to be a theme throughout our stay, was how genuinely friendly the staff is. Not the ""I'm friendly because it's my job"" friendly, but the ""genuinely happy to see you"" friendly. Doormen, front desk, housekeeping, terrace staff: every single person we encountered was super friendly and accommodating. The hotel manager, Petr, checked in with us throughout . After learning our tastes and preferences, Petr made spot-on restaurant recommendations. Not the touristy ones the everyone already knows about, but the small hidden gem restaurants that could otherwise go unnoticed except for a dedicated local following. Clearly, Petr genuinely listened to us. One of the many amenities that comes with staying at the Westhouse is the morning breakfast and the late afternoon ""hours of indulgence"". Going in, I thought wrongly - oh so very wrongly- that this would be a generic continental breakfast and a little meat and cheese spread in the afternoon. The breakfast always had freshly made eggs, meat and lots of other goodies. The coup de grace was the afternoon hours of indulgence. In addition to a wide selection of cheese, Italian meats and very delicious wines was a daily, freshly made hot item worthy of New York's best restaurants. Once, manicotti was offered, and on another day, the best seafood paella that I ever had the privilege to savor. I have been to NYC dozens of times in my life. I have stayed at quite a few very fine hotels. Without a doubt, my most enjoyable and most memorable visit was our stay at the Westhouse.

We stayed at Park Central and I'm so glad we booked here. We arrived early so expected to just drop off our bags, but they allowed us to checkin early as there was a room ready/available. Upon arrival, we were greeted with exceptional hospitality and asked if we needed any recommendations on places to eat/things to do, and given a city map. Once we went up to our room, we noticed a smell (like a musty/wet mop smell). It was quite strong, but we figured that room was just cleaned and that the smell would go away. Approximately 10mins after checking in, someone knocked on the door to inspect the room and make sure we were happy with it. We noted the smell and she figured out that it was the shower curtain and said they would replace that ASAP for us. We left for the afternoon and when we got back the smell was completely gone and the curtain had been changed (we were more than impressed with this service). Despite some comments, I did not find the room AS small as most people stated. The A/C worked amazing, the beds/pillows were extremely comfortable, and to top it off, free wifi was given (which appears quite hard to find in NY).

We were on the 20th floor with an amazing view and a large room. But the A/C was broken and it was 90+ outside. (tried switching rooms but that one was broken too) We were not fans of sleeping in sweat so we moved hotels to the Park Central and booked it through Hotel Tonight. Daphne at the front desk was awesome. Pros: Easy check in, friendly staff, huge lobby, nice people working lobby bar, plenty of space in lobby bar to relax and mingle. A/C in room was cold and worked well. Great location. 4 subway stops virtually on every corner leaving the hotel. 1-2 blocks north was Central Park. 5-6 blocks south was Time Square. When you walk out of the hotel and look right you see the main lights of time square and the new years eve ball. Close to Premiere Deli. Awesome inexpensive food and if you order on grubhub they will bring it to your lobby. Cons: They are doing construction at Carnegie Hall and we were on the 4th floor. It was kind of loud during the day with jack hammers. We only really noticed it on check out day because we were out of the room most of the time. Room size is small. Bathroom is small. View is average. You may want to request a higher floor for less noise and a city or park view if they have it.

Checked in on 7/13 and then on 7/15, I realized that two pair of very expensive glasses were missing from our room. One pair of Ray Ban sunglasses and one pair of prescription Tom Ford glasses that were tucked away in our suitcase were missing when we went to pack our stuff. We searched the room up and down, all over the place and nothing was found. These glasses were both tucked away in bags and did not leave the room. Saturday morning before leaving, we locked our valuables in the safe and left the glasses tucked away in our bag and suitcase. On Sunday, we filed a report with security, who was completely unaware of protocol and the appropriate procedures in this situation. He advised us to ask Customer Service about the next steps (because he was unaware of them himself). When we checked out, we stopped at Customer Service before leaving and they were of no help either. Quite frankly, they were condescending and patronizing towards us saying that they would ""check the footage on security cameras"" and the ""card access history."" Then when I asked up front what would happen next, they said their ""head of security"" would not be working until the next day, leaving us with no further information. Out of all the hotels I have stayed in, I have never thought twice about having my glasses STOLEN. In addition to this very disappointing event, every time we would come back to the room in the evening, the entire third floor reeked of marijuana both nights. My only hope is that there is some sort of resolution/recovery when/if I hear back from the security director. We will NOT be coming back to this hotel.

My lady friend and I went here in April of this year as we were looking for a nice hotel that was close to the Metropolitan Opera House and other major attractions and this perfectly met our expectations. From this hotel, Central Park is about a 10-minute walk, Times Square about 15-20 minutes, the Lincoln Center, a 5-minute taxi ride. There is also an entrance to the subway conveniently located outside the hotel for those of you who would like to use public transit to explore other parts of the city like Brooklyn or Lower Manhattan. Customer service at this hotel was friendly. When making inquiries about buying tickets to the MET Museum and Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises, the staff were always willing to answer our questions and help us out. They also have a printing station conveniently located in the lobby that is free of charge if you need to print any personal stuff. The man who served us our drinks at the lounge area also made us feel very welcome there. On our last day, they also had a desk where we dropped off our luggage for safe-keeping, since check-out was in the morning and our flight home was not until the evening, so that we were able to continue with some last-minute adventures in the city.Our room was clean and had a nice view of the city from our window. I loved the wall divider that separated both of our beds, which gave each of us that extra privacy. Wifi signal was fast and easy to set-up as well. The furniture, decor, and the hallways also had a nice New Yorker vibe to it. We paid a lot of money for this hotel but it was well worth it. Overall, I would definitely stay here again the next time we need a hotel in the city.","Toronto, Canada",3,5.0

The hotel is surround by numerous options of great places for breakfast or lunch and close to great restaurants for dinner (all price levels.)

Because we checked in early, she was only able to provide us with 1 of the 3 rooms to secure our luggage, but assured us we’d be fine when we returned from our conference that night.When we got back to the hotel at 10:30 p.m. that night 1 of the 3 additional rooms had been cancelled. The desk attendant called over the manager on duty, Nahn. From the beginning he was combative. He rudely asked me what the problem was. I explained the woman at the front desk told me my male students room had been cancelled. As a female educator traveling with students, this was alarming being so far away from home with no other options. Than went on to rudely say the room name was not in the system. I kindly explained our morning situations as well as the fact that the front desk attendant had just told me the room had been zeroed out when I gave them Justin’s name.Than became even more condescending explaining to me that Park Central is a luxury hotel. He never once stopped to assure me he’d get the situation resolved. Instead he kept rudely asking me questions for another 20 minutes only to later find Justin a room on the ninth floor.When I got back up to the room I called the front desk to ask who was the manager on duty. They refused to share his name. I got in my pajamas relieved we were all in our rooms after an 18 hour day and crawled into bed. My phone rang and a condescending voice asked me to come back down to the lobby to run my credit card on the room. I explained I was in my pajamas after an 18 hour day at which time he got more combative trying to explain to me that he was doing me a favor. I’m not sure what the flavor was. I asked him for his name and your name, at which time he told me you’d be available on Friday.On Friday when I came down to speak to the general manager, he was on the phone. Our paths never crossed because of the extensive amount of conferences we had to attend while in NYC.Each year I bring students to New York for the Columbia Scholastic Press Association National Conference. I have always stayed at the Park Central. I have also referred other faculty members that attend this conference to stay at this location. After this terrible treatment I will never stay at the Park Central again. Nahn’s lack of customer service and arrogance did not exclude the luxury brand he tried to proclaim about the Park Central. I’ve stayed at many hotels and been treated much kinder. In this industry, customer service is key. Nahn clearly are not ready for the position he has. Perhaps they should attend sensitivity training where they learns the value of customer service. As an educator I too am in the people business. I understand that kindness is a choice, it is one I choose to take. Perhaps the Park Central would be better served with someone that treats others the way they wants to be treated.","Las Vegas, Nevada",18,1.0

The person behind the desk asked for an ID which I did not have at the time and was refused service because of hotel policy. I was not offered any alternative solutions nor asked for additional information. I felt very dismissed and the experience left a sour note. So I had to wait until for the other half to return to have access to the room.2 - the room smelled musty so I had to opened up all the windows to let some fresh air in. The room my in-laws were in had the same must odor. They had to request for a new shower curtain because the smell was soo bad.3 - the windows of this hotel are not sound proof meaning get ready for some restless nights. Sound from the street carries and you can hear it from you room. If you plan on a quiet night and this hotel, don't count on it.4 - the hotel does not come with its own refrigerator. So if you need one, you have to ask for it and count on a couple of hours or more to have it delivered to your room.5 - walls not insulated.

And as some reviewers have mentioned the $35 nightly fee for “free” WiFi and gym (which we didn’t use) seemed expensive particularly if there for almost a week. That said, everything else was fine. The staff were friendly, prompt and helpful, the room clean and the location fantastic being two blocks from a subway, five minutes from Central Park and Times Square.

Another member of our party booked the room.. when we arrived they asked for a 50/per night deposit on a card, First red flag, most hotels that actually care about their guests and trust them enough not to utilize advance holds. Although I didn’t book the room, I reluctantly agreed to allow the deposit on to my credit card. I will say the room was clean, comfortable, and stay was otherwise fine. The real problem came at checkout, when the front desk person then asked to put a 35/night “resort fee” on the same card where my $150 deposit hold lay. I had never been informed of this (granted I didn’t book it). The fee is supposedly justified by several amenities, such as fitness center access, but this is something I did not use, (and something most hotels don’t charge for). The place is not a “Resort” by any means, it’s a normal hotel. The combination of the deposit hold and resort fee, Felt like I was getting a little swindled. They use a barely visible after booking fee, and they take a deposit to make sure they get. Maybe I’m a little old-school when it comes to hospitality, so I don’t like the feeling of being disingenuously “nickel and dimed” by a place I choose to rest my head. I know plenty of other hotels in NY, with admittedly better quality and similar prices that don’t take the hidden fee route.

Spacious room - at least mine was - with 2 double beds, decent bathroom with tub/shower combo, desk, dresser, plenty of closet space. Also toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, gel, soap and lotion all very decent.) They have a blow dryer and iron - and that's good. Plenty of hangers too. And that's where the 'what's good' ends.Improvements needed: Clean up the rooms - shades soiled, carpeting dirty, walls dirty. Bath towels thin and way too small. HORRIBLE LIGHTING! For women this no-decent lighting in the bathroom pretty much means you can't see jack-all when trying to put on makeup, etc. - so you leave the hotel kinda scary looking! THEY HAVE NO RESTAURANT ON PREMISE! AGH! You cannot access any food or drink 24 hours there - not at all. They have a little market in the building that is open some hours - but NOT 24/7. NO room service. So at normal NYC time - you've got no access to anything in hotel so must leave premises to get food/drink that you want to have back in your room. Concierge NOT friendly or helpful - and the right hand mos def does NOT know what the left hand is doing. Everyone gives constantly conflicting info! First they told me that the restaurant next door, the Redeye Grill, was closed. Then they said no it's open. Then they said no it's closed. But wait there's more! Then...they told me I did NOT have to come and re-key for my 3rd/additional night in hotel. Then they told me I did need to come re-key for my 3rd night. Then they said I didn't need to. Then they said I did. My gawd - no one knows what's going on. The have no umbrellas to lend/charge to your room if needed. NO bathrobes in room. AND EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE DO NOT DISTURB ON YOUR DOOR - MAIDS KNOCK AWAY! Do not disturb in ANY hotel that I have EVER stayed means STAY OUT. But they don't care there - they knock anyway. What's more is that if you just don't want maid service at all - doesn't matter - they will NOT let you go more than one day without maid service. They call you and leave you a message that they MUST come into the room to check. Lord. I also asked for a late checkout - I don't mean hours late - I mean one hour late - and they wouldn't do it. Net is - NOT A SERVICE ORIENTED HOTEL and little to NO amenities.In the more ramble category - do NOT let the door man get a taxi for you. He's getting some payola with the taxi drivers and he won't put you in the next one - he will put you in the one where he gets his payoff.

And I was going from Park Central to EWR and the door man put me in a city city city taxi - teeny weeny - the plexiglass burglary bullet proof glass was RIGHT IN MY FACE - it was hella claustrophobic - and for a NYC to New Jersey drive - they should have put me in a larger taxi or SUV. And well here again - I really should have gotten out; but I followed the instructions of the door man - but never again.Also, you could die of exhaustion or starvation, and *will most definitely be late for any meeting* you have, waiting on the elevators! Geez louize! The elevators are slow as molasses.Net net net is - the hotel is grossly overpriced for a little to no service, no amenities property. No room service. No 24/7 room/drink access without getting dressed and leaving the hotel. Horrible lighting in room and bathroom. No robes. And don't let the door man get you a taxi; get one yourself. And rooms majorly need a face lift. I would say most of the clientele are not very high class - so neither the hotel or guests are elegant by any stretch of the imagination.

They said the room would take longer to be ready but they could hold our bags, which was fine. But then our room was not ready until after their normal check in time after 4 PM. After finally getting to our room, we had so many problems. The toilet broke 3 times in two days, and the phone in the room was broken so we had to go to the lobby each time to tell someone.

This hotel is rated at 4*, I would say it is probably around 3*.The good points are its excellent location, very comfortable beds, very clean.The bad points are BE WARE there is a compulsory $35 plus tax charge per room per night for the complimentary services that we did not want to use, so the price we paid worked out around $500 more than advertised online by Hotels.com; very tired drab décor, all gloomy grey and brown colours (not a modern take on those, but closer to the 1980s), not powerful showers but they seem to have been refurbished, so are clean. The customer service is rubbish in practice but excellent in words. We wanted to change the location of our interconnecting rooms as we had a noisy bin lorry under the windows throughout the night (although we were on 11 floor, the windows are not very well insulated so can hear everything) ,so asked if anything can be done, the manager on the front desk offered to change our rooms to the opposite side of the hotel. We specifically asked if it would be possible to have interconnecting rooms (we had children with us) and not be near the lifts. So after spending an hour packing and waiting for new keys we were told our new rooms were ready, imagine our surprise when we found out that the rooms were not interconnecting, one was near the lifts and the other on the exactly the same side of the building as the original rooms and both on the lower floor, so closer to the lorry! We then spend 30 min more unpacking in our original rooms and were wondering what the manager was thinking in offering to change the rooms and offering exactly what we did not want! A waste of 2 hours of the evening.Overall a disappointing hotel as it is definitely not 4 stars and the additional compulsory charge was a real turn off.",UK/Russia,25,2.0

This was the latter,Going to be as concise as one can be.Pros:Location - that's it!Cons: 1. Check-in is at 4pm. This is unheard of. I've never experienced any hotel in the world that has a 4pm check-in time. I tried checking in at 2p and 3p, my room wasn't ready. Was ready by 3:45pm.2. Rooms are OK, at least mine was. However, I did not get any sun whatsoever during my 4-night stay. The closet has no light. Rooms are very small. 3. On the day of check out, I called at 8am for a late checkout, they said they'll let front desk call me back to confirm. They never did. I called back at 9am, and they told me the same thing. They never called back. I called back at 9:45am and complained, they apologized saying they can't give me a late check out. So after waiting for almost 2 hours, I still couldn't get a late checkout. I explained how bad their service was, so they gave me a checkout till 1pm. So so generous of them.Class ""A"" Thieves:1. First day at the hotel, I asked guest services if I can ship packages to the hotel and they said yes. I asked if they charged, they told me it was free. (This can be verified with their phone records as all phone calls are recorded). Upon checkout, I was charged $30 storage fee. I had 3 packages come in, and it turns out they charge $10 per package. Again, I've never seen this done by any hotel whatsoever. We went back and forth about the charges for a good 5 minutes and asked them if they could waive it, they were so adamant that they wont, and never did. 2. Resort fees. Beware. They charge you $35 + tax per day per night (excluding the room rate). 90% of people won't use 90% of what is associated with those fees. I clearly explained upon checkout that I was unaware of this and it should've been mentioned clearly upon check in, and see if they can (partially) waive it. But It's like watching paint dry, they are useless. I spoke to their guest services manager (forgot her name, of Asian descent), and she was probably one of the most useless individuals I have ever came across, in the likes of which, I've never seen before. I came to find out that my friend stayed in the hotel next to Park Central who also had similar resort fees but they were nice enough to give him a one-time waiver as he was unaware of them. I paid almost $200 for resort fees and storage fees extra upon checkout. Never experienced such thing. I hope whoever reads this change their minds about staying there. I am more than willing to provide info about other hotels around the same area. Just please stay away from this.","Chicago, Illinois",25,1.0

I know that at times, it is hard to keep up an impeccable level of service when managing a large staff that serves hundreds of rooms. However, this hotel has left me and my family impressed at how bad our overall experience was. From reception to our room to the disrespectful and dismissive manner of the manager on duty, I genuinely felt that they were trying to make our stay as bad as it was.First, when we arrived with our reservation, they told us that we had to pay a resort fee of $35 per night. When my husband asked what was the fee for, the agent said he wasn't even sure.When we tried to take the elevator, we didn't know how to use it, it would have been appropriate if someone explained this, but no big deal, we figured it out and brushed it off.The room. WOW!!! Nasty is not enough to describe, endless stains on the carpet, the walls, paint peeling off, the toilet paper holder was broken, the phone only worked on speaker mode. UNSAFE! We had our two little kids with us and they like to explore drawers, to their surprise, the drawers very easily come off to the floor towards their precious feet, not one, three of them! (make sure to scroll through the pictures on their profile, only the nice ones show up first, I guess paying yelp a monthly fee to enhance their profile goes a long way!).Even more disgusting: when we came back from our day out, I found a nasty smelly wet rag under our clothes. Obviously not ours.TWICE I had to use the stairs all the way up to 7th floor due to their failing elevator system. One morning we got stuck trying to go down to start our day and ended up waiting 30 min for the elevator (which never came). I had to use the stairs all the way down to ask for help, since I've worked in hotels I knew they must have service elevators, however, the ""manager"" apologized and said there was nothing they could do, she quickly blamed a guest for ""pushing the wrong button and breaking the elevator "" and proceeded to tell me it was gonna be 30-40 min before it was fixed and suggested we took the stairs with our two little kids and their stroller. Her manner that day was arrogant and I felt that she was very annoyed with my observations. After I ran back all the way upstairs to get my kids and husband, there was another family waiting for the elevator. Luckily, there was a staff member who overheard our situation and offered to let us use the service elevator, it was appalling to me that he quickly figured out what to do vs. his manager. The next morning I looked for the hotel manager again and tried to explain in very simple and friendly words our disappointment with the service and room. At first, her manner was again rather serious and non-empathetic, until I showed her pictures of the nasty rag we found and the drawers that easily come off potentially injuring our kids. At that point, she became very friendly, she offered a room upgrade, free breakfast, and to waive the resort fee. We didn't want to change rooms because it was more of a pain with our stuff and the kids than it was worth it, we didn't want to eat breakfast there, and she only waved 2 days worth of the resort fee instead of 3 as she said she would.When I mentioned that when we booked we weren't aware of the resort fee and kind of room we'd get, I explained we did it through Hoteltonight.com, to which she had the need to mention 3 TIMES that they had the lowest rates around. To this, I responded ""do you mean that we paid for what we got?"", of course, she denied it, but it was well implied. So yes, we got a cheaper rate, we still spent about $600 for 3 nights at this hotel, and we felt it wasn't worth it. These rooms are supposed to be $400 per night rooms, how do they get away with this is beyond me. Please save yourself the frustration and the extra few bucks and book elsewhere.",,3,1.0

Speaking of NYC hotels, the room was pretty big for a Manhattan property - the size would be considered adequate or better almost any place, much less in the Big Town. Check-in was quick and friendly, and the staff helped us immediately when one of our key cards decided not to work in either the room lock or the elevator (the key card is required for access to the guest floors, a good security feature). The neighborhood was very safe, and there were plenty of places to eat close by at OK prices. The hotel has a very attractive bar/restaurant, but we didn't eat there.For the record, because we were traveling in a large group (about 70 of our chorus members were staying there), we got a very favorable rate - but the rate would have been reasonable for NYC hotels in any case.We enjoyed our stay here very much and would be happy to stay here any time...","Washington DC, District of Columbia",17,4.0

The tickets we paid 149.99 each for had a face value of 89 each. I asked about the 60% markup, he said they got a deal, that was not what the tickets were really selling for.

The staff is quite friendly and accommodating. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms are quite spacious with a safe available in the rooms. Unfortunately there are no mini fridges in the basic rooms. It was very clean and comfortable and has a lot of amenities such as a lounge bar, computers with printer service, and a fitness facility. I think one of the best things about this hotel in particular is the location which is along 7th Ave. not far from Time Square, Central Park, and Carnegie Hall, and the Rockefeller center. There are shops, bars and restaurants all around so you have a very good selection of choices. A subway stop is right nearby the hotel making it easy to get to and from there with public transportation. One thing I really enjoyed was the complementary luggage storage which is great if you have a later departure and wish to see one more day of New York without having to worry about carrying around your luggage. The service is free and holds your luggage until 10:45PM. The area was quite safe, moderately quiet, and clean. It's a very good value for you money. Keep in mind that there is a facility fee which can cost a bit more money depending on how long you stay. All in all it was a great hotel and I would definitely stay there again.","Roswell, New Mexico",29,5.0

I generally try to avoid staying in (or going near) that part of Manhattan when we visit except to see a show and after this past visit I realized it was with good reason. I guess because the hotel is reasonably priced and close to Carnegie Hall and Lincoln center we experienced a constant cycling through of huge groups of teenagers who were there to perform for various events- the lobby was constantly crowded and there was almost always a wait for the elevators. We asked for a quiet room at check in and were given a 5th-floor room facing a wall with an adjoining door - we had to listen to our neighbors as though we were all sitting in the same room together. On our last night, our hall was overrun with teenage boys who seemed to be without adult supervision- it was 1AM before the manager and security were able to get them quieted down for the evening and when we left for our flight at 6AM the next morning there were pizza boxes piled up everywhere. The very comfortable bed and bedding, and spacious, clean room along with a reasonable stretch of quiet time at night on every other night made the stay bearable.

The hotel situates close to the parade route and right on the marathon route. Front staffs were handling big crowds efficiently, so check-in was quick. We arrived early in the morning, so our room was not available. I requested lower level of room for the reason of accessibility. However, we were given 16th floor when we came back @3 p.m. to check in. I thought that it was very busy weekend with groups, so they ran out of lower level rooms. Our room 1628 was a ""cave"". It locates very end of the hallway and the view from large window was literally brick walls of next building because it faces inward. Quiet... yes, because we are the end of the hallway. Dark... very much because no sunlight could come through due to the hight of next building. Even with all room lights on, we felt like the room was at night. The room seemed to be remodeled recently, but not completely, I saw chipped paints on the front door, the corner of windowsills, bathroom floor... felt like that we were assigned the left-over room. We used ""Roomer"" to get discount which actually was from Expedia. It was discounted, but no less than hotel's advertised rate of $175/night. Luckily, we did not stay in the room too long, and again, knowing how crowded the hotel was, I did not make effort to request for another room. Bathtub stopper did not work. Water pressure for shower was sufficient, but as many reviews mentioned, toilet water pressure was weak. Plenty of towels, but all shampoo, conditioner, body wash bottles are mounted on the bathtub wall. I prefer individual travel size bottles for sanitary reason. No plastic linings for trash bins. Overall, the room amenity did not justify the price they charge. It should be less than $100 per night for what they are.Elevators: Although there are 4 elevators, only 2 were working. As many reviews, I agree that the elevator size was small. Extra security of activate floor stop with your room key was Okay... One elevator's bottom did not light up for the floor selection, so it was confusing. The speed was sufficient. However, considering may guests, especially international guests with large suitcases, the elevator filled up very quickly. They should have a bell service to bring all large suit cases with flight elevators to each guest rooms. Billing: unknown charge appeared from hotel twice without explanation from the front staff at the time of check-in, so I had to call back and to send email to billing department.The location is vey convenient for Upper Westside tourism.

Park Central guaranteed, and confirmed in writing, that all rooms would be on the same floor, and that we would have ""deluxe queen"" beds for our student rooms. This would allow them to share beds.It wasn't until we checked into our rooms that we realized that wasn't true. Many of the beds were double beds -- and 17-year-old high school boys particularly weren't able to double up in such a small space.The queen beds were the perk that Park Central used to persuade us to stay with them, rather than our original choice. The floor of the hotel was the same one they agreed to, in writing. And they were apparently waiting to see if we noticed the contract was broken. I let them know on March 1st, shortly after our arrival.I reminded Park Central (as per our original agreement) that we needed to be on one floor as a group, as students needed to remain near chaperones. The next morning, they told us that one of our rooms would be exchanged for an actual Double Queen room, and that the girls in it needed to move out immediately. They did -- and still hadn't been given a new room by late afternoon. That made changing and preparing for our competition throughout the day -- there were a mix of committee sessions and NYC tours -- much more difficult and rather inconvenient. Finally, in the evening, they received their room.Eleven days later, I am still waiting for a refund -- both for a discount on the cost of the rooms (as they were not the rooms we paid for) and for a room refund that we let the hotel know a month in advance (after our early payment) that we would not be booking. For each, Park Central assured us there would be a refund. Since our stay, I have not received a reply.I will be happy to update this review if we receive a reply and refund. It's unfortunate that what could have been a pleasant stay was marred by dishonesty and lack of follow-through.PS: One other thing worth noting is that the rooms, which we arranged in advance of the trip to have refrigerators, did not. We reminded the hotel before our arrival, after arrival, and on day two of our stay. By day three they all had refrigerators.",,3,1.0

As NYC residents, I wanted to book a nice hotel room to feel like we were on vacation for one night without having to leave the city-and it was all going to be a surprise! This is not the right hotel for a nice night in the city. I figured for paying over $300 for one night, the room would be at least a little special. The room was small, had no qualities that I think made it a ""premier"" room as it was advertised on the website, and the cushy chair in the room had a large brown stain on it. When I went to turn the TV on, half of the channels did not come through because of 'poor connection.' My premier room was also directly across from the elevators, and I could hear everyone on the floor coming and going during the few minutes I was in the room. I called down to guest services to see if we could switch rooms to another room within the same price-the guest representative said he had to speak to his manager and would give me a call back. After waiting 20 minutes and not hearing anything, I decided this hotel reservation as not worth the cost and my husband and I would be more comfortable staying at home that night even if it meant eating the money I spent on the 'surprise.' I went to guest services, and as I expected since I was cancelling my reservation within the 24 hours window before my reservation started, I would be charged for the night. I also found out when I thought I would be charged $305 for the room (as per my confirmed email from Hotels.com where I booked the room), I would be charged $395-between mandatory charges for amenities I was not even using and taxes I was way overcharged for what that room would have been.Lesson learned-don't book at Park Central Hotel when wanting a nice hotel room for the night. Very disappointed as a local in the city that a hotel would overcharge SO much and have poor customer service for a not satisfied customer.",,2,1.0

Just below and close to Central Park, and close to Broadway etc. The room price seemed good value first but there is an additional fee which is mandatory, and the idea is sold as you would be getting something great additions to your visit. Well, I think getting wifi should anyway be complimentary, and also keeping your luggage few hours after your check-out at the hotel if needed. The breakfast still sounded first as something worth something. How wrong was I. It was ridiculous. You get a coupon to be used at the take-out kiosk cafe. You can have a croissant, one hot or cold drink and one more item which was specific (I don’t even remember what anymore as I didn’t want it).I did not want croissant, but sandwich. I also wanted both the orange juice and the coffee. With those three items and I had to pay almost 10 dollars extra. It was printed in the coupon, so the kiosk followed the rules. Still, just ridiculous.The room was just average. It delivered though - like a bulk business hotel does.The lounge downstairs behind the reception desks though is excellent. Big and still private tranquil oasis to work, meet or relax.With the basic amenities included in the price (even with then higher price) and better breakfast offering, and this would get one more star.","Boston, Massachusetts",107,3.0

After making a shortlist and reading 100s of confusingly conflicting reviews, we settled on Park Central and it was perfect for our stay. We wanted a handy central location, ideally near Central Park. Tick! Park Central is one block from Central Park, enabling me to go for a morning run, adding an exciting (and freeeeezing!) post to my Strava profile and easy walking distance to Broadway, Times Square and other major attractions. It needed to be clean and well maintained. I didn’t mind about it being especially ‘fancy’ but I didn’t want to spend a special two days in an amazing city and come back with my children to a room that was grotty. I was a little concerned before our arrival about a number of reviewers that reported damp rooms, disrepair, slow/bad service, rooms not ready. I think maybe there has just been a major refurb recently if older reviews are to be believed or I don’t know which hotel they were reviewing at all! We found Park Central to be very well maintained and spotlessly clean. The whole hotel - lobby, lounge area as well as our room and bathroom - were classy and elegant, far more so than you’d get for the price in London and very spacious too. We were greeted by the most friendly, cheerful bellman/Porter/valet Parker who took all of our bags and greeted us in and out of the building every time we came and went. We were hours too early for our room so intended to leave our bags and head out to explore. However, reception staff quickly checked us in and we were shown straight up to our beautiful room in minutes. Quick turn around an we were dressed for the weather and out on our adventure. We chose a dual aspect room with views over the front corner of the hotel, towards the park and it was beautiful. We had two double beds, and armchair and footstool, desk and chair, clothing storage and a good sized bathroom with a bath and shower. There was good free WiFi, a pad and pencil and some lovely (local?) aromatherapy toiletries in the bathroom. Other than that, nothing else included in the room - no drinks making facilities and no free TV as far as we could make out. But for our visit, these things didn’t matter. The Park Market in the lobby was very well stocked with quite a good choice of breakfast items - fruit salad pots, yoghurt, pastries, cereals, juice, hot drinks and packed lunch items - crisps/chips, sandwiches... All a little pricy but everything we had was nice. We asked about bringing takeout food to our room one evening and they said it was fine and even offered to find and order what we wanted. (We stepped out ourself and found a great pizza place a few yards away on the same side.)All in All, for a very busy few days with young children, Park Central was a great location, a standard of style to make it feel really special, clean and comfortable to collapse after a long day and well looked after by professional and extremely friendly staff. Would thoroughly recommend it to couples and families. The ONLY thing I would’ve added to make it perfect was to be able to have a coffee in bed, made in our room.

We had two for our block and they were very small. Often we had to use the stairs because the elevator was already full.

We stayed for seven nights while visiting New York. I'll split my review into different parts for ease of reading:The roomWe didn't spend a lot of time in the room as we wanted to maximise our stay in NYC by being out and about. The room had two double beds, a TV, fridge and a bathroom. The side tables near the bed had outlets which were handy for phone charging. The shower was a lovely pressure and the bathroom was large enough for getting ready each day. The only main issue was that there was no overhead light which we found quite strange - you had to rely on the lamps in the room to provide the light. Even opening the blind over the window did not assist as the sun was blocked by the rest of the building. However, this is not a dealbreaker - the room was wonderfully comfortable for our needs - it was always made up when we returned and the beds were super comfortable.The Location:Central. Convenient. If you are looking for somewhere convenient to stay, this is definitely it. A block from Columbus Circle/Central Park, a 10 minute walk down to Times Square and on the same block as a main Subway line, this hotel was super well located. There were always taxis waiting outside and plenty of room for an uber/lyft to pick you up. The coffee place next door made amazing coffee and was a good first stop for us each day before we headed out. The Service:The front desk was lovely and we always got assistance when needed. I ordered a pair of shoes online and had them delivered to the hotel and they held it for me BUT they charged a holding fee so beware of that. There was always a welcoming face upon our return - regardless of how late/early it was and checkout was a breeze.Extras/Hints:There is a $70+ resort fee PER day, so just a warning. There are two lifts to access and they are always busy - if you don't have bags, use the stairs it will save you so much time! (we were only on the third floor, so this was easier for us, this won't be the case if you're higher up obviously!)We did a hop on/hop off tour on our last day for fun, and the hotel has a little history we didn't realise - definitely worth googling!Overall I would likely stay here again/recommend to a friend.","Sydney, Australia",36,4.0

Our room was nice, clean with modern decor, however, it lacked modern facilities you might expect in a 4* hotel such as USB plugs or a mini fridge which was disappointing for the price we paid (about £1200). As expected, the hotel shop where you could get water/drinks/snacks was ridiculously expensive, I think we paid almost twenty dollars for a few bottles of drink and a bar of chocolate the first night! Needless to say we didn’t shop there again, there are plenty of shops locally. Another disappointment was the hotel lifts. For such a large hotel they had very few lifts, and all very slow, which always seemed to result in a lengthy wait and then letting a couple go by as they were too full.One evening we were staying we went down to the bar to find out it was shut for a private event. When we enquired when it was opening we were quite abruptly told there had been an email about it (although not everyone checks these while away) and that it was closed all evening, no apologies for any inconvenience caused or anything. However, on a different note the waitress at the bar (Nancy) was great the few times we did visit, although she always seemed to be the only one serving so service was slow, but she was always very polite despite being rushed off her feet!Overall we had a nice stay, the location of the hotel is brilliant as you are never far from anything including the subway. However, for the price we paid (including hefty facilities fees) we would stay somewhere else if we were to return to New York. We had previously stayed at a nearby hotel for example that included two hours of drinks/snacks every evening which was a nice touch. ","Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",30,3.0

After 4 days, it gets a bit grim. Secondly, the daily facilities charge is a bit cheeky and certainly does not help create a good memory of the hotel.

In the past, we found it to be an affordable, well-run hotel at a very good location in Manhattan. This time, we were a bit disappointed.We had requested a King bed when we made our reservation, but were told at check-in that, despite our reservation made weeks in advance, none were available. The front desk receptionist made no effort to accommodate our request. Unlike our experience before, the front desk agent was unapologetic and condescending.We finally settled for a double queen room on the seventh floor. We were told that we had to wait until 4 pm for a room because they were all being cleaned. When we finally got to our room, we found it to be only marginally clean. The carpet had not been vacuumed. The glasses had obviously been used by the previous occupants and were not replaced. The beds were obviously made up in a hurry as the sheets did not stay in place when we retired for the night. We had to remake the beds. The bath tub hardware was broken and laying in the tub. The room attendants had made no effort to repair the tub and had not reported it to maintenance.To be fair, when we reported these inconveniences to the manager, he promptly took care of the issues and offered us compensation. We had no further issues until check-out day when our room keys were electronically deactivated an hour prior to checkout time. When we returned from a late breakfast, we were not able to access our room even though we had more than an hour before checkout at noon.We hope this was an unusual stay that will not be repeated when we return because the Park Central's location - close to Central Park, Time's Square, Rockefeller Center, Carnegie Hall and our favorite restaurants and shopping - is excellent for our purposes.","Austin, Texas",11,4.0

HERE'S WHY!On July 24th a lightning strike burned my house down. Since then life has been rough to say the least as I’m a single mother of twin 5 year old daughters. So, I booked a 4 night stay at Park Central Hotel (12/8/17-12/12/17) even though it wasn’t really in the budget because I really wanted to surprise my daughters with an amazing Christmas time trip! I thought a few days of ice skating in Rockefeller Center and Macy’s Santaland would be just what we needed to forget about having lost everything in our worlds. I thought, do it now, money is money, memories are forever. So I got down to the business of planning!I booked my stay online and specified I needed TWO QUEEN BEDS AND A ROLLAWAY. Then I called because I wanted to make sure we got a rollaway and I knew that was a request only item and this trip was VERY important to me! They confirmed all was great and the notes were on my reservations, they said “make sure you call the hotel directly just in case.” So I DID! I called the hotel DIRECTLY! Spoke to the HOTEL STAFF DIRECTLY and confirmed TWO QUEEN BEDS AND A ROLLAWAY! I felt confident and went about making reservations for the rest of the trip.Fast forward to arriving at the hotel. We walk up to the desk with my, now exhausted, twin 5 year old daughters in tow, at around 6:30pm. The RUDE woman at the desk says that she has me down for two queen beds. I remind her of the rollaway I’ve called about and she says “no way ma’am, that’s a fire hazard, you can’t have a rollaway in ANY of those rooms”. WHAT!!! I tell her I’ve called the hotel DIRECTLY and they’ve told me that it’s on my reservation and won’t be a problem at all. HERE IS WHERE IT GETS CRAZY! She says “yes ma’am I can see that you called, I have that here, but we can’t put a rollaway in those rooms so it’s not happening. It’s a fire hazard.” Again, WHAT!!!! So I tell her I need the bed and they already confirmed it, if it couldn’t be done then they SHOULD have told me ON THE PHONE. I tell her they need to put us in a room with enough space and she says “sorry, we’re fully booked.” Agaaain, WHAT!!!!! I am about to cry at this point because I’ve literally used all the money I have to take my daughters on this trip and we are now in New York and it is too late to undo anything and she says “you can have a breakfast voucher.” !!!!! WHAAAAT!!! The voucher that pays for a muffin and a juice! REALLY! The room was $450 a NIGHT!!!! So when I start to freak out she says “look I can move you to a queen bed with a pull out couch, we can fit a rollaway in there.” I tell her if that’s the case I need to have my room fee adjusted because I paid for two BEDS, not a bed and a old couch, and she smirks and says “no. That’s a suite, your lucky we can even put you in that.” I WAS SO UPSET!!! She did not care at all! NOT AT ALL! No apology! NOTHING! I asked if they could apply an active duty military discount (my travel companion had his ID present for them to view if needed) to offset costs and she laughed and ignored me! So...what? You also don’t care about the military?? I was desperately trying to fix what YOUR STAFF had ROYALLY messed up and was getting mocked in the process! I gave up and spent the next 20 minutes waiting for one of the TWO elevators that service all the floors of your hotel to have room to carry us to our 6th floor “suite” with one bed, a pullout, a rollaway and a $450 a night price tag. (Oh and I didn’t even get the “breakfast”, the RUDE woman in the HORRIBLY OVERPRICED shop said I couldn’t have “that muffin” bc it “wasn’t covered by the voucher” and I “had to choose from those ones” so I got mad and gave up.)Well, Park Central. You should be ASHAMED of yourself!! Your behavior and treatment of my family and I makes me SICK TO MY STOMACH! I hope that those among you that own and operate your facility never find yourself standing in front of your home watching everything you love and worked so hard to acquire burn to ash in front of you! And I hope than that if it does, when you finally see a crack of light peeking through the clouds, there isn’t a smirking rude monster of a business that doesn’t care about its customers AT ALL waiting to crush you even further down. You took $2000 dollars from me and I slept on a piece of garbage uncomfortable old pullout for four days.My only question:ARE YOU PROUD OF YOURSELF?!","Leander, Texas",6,1.0

I appreciate that if you are after a hotel in a convenient location in mid-town, then the pricing is not bad. But what a price to pay. The good points: good location, it is clean, and the room cleaning staff were an absolute delight - simply lovely. That's about it on the plus side. On the negative side: the rooms are small and cramped, and the lighting is woefully inadequate - in particular the desk area where you can work is almost in complete darkness. They do not even provide shower caps, which I would have thought was standard. The plug in the bath did not work properly, but at least they provided two flannels, one of which could be used to bung it up. The lifts are very slow and do not have enough capacity, leading to long waiting times. I usually bond with the reception staff, but there was none of that here - very much lacking in any charm. Then there is piped music everywhere - you cannot get away from it. When I came to check out there was a very long queue and one person on the desk when there is provision for three. I actually thought of calling the hotel on my mobile to see if they could put more staff on to hurry things up. This hotel left me feeling cold, and despite having meetings after I checked out, I preferred to carry my luggage around Manhattan rather than having to face going back to the hotel.

Simply put it is the Park Central's way of offering a low rate when you search for hotels and then adding the balance afterwards.On top of that the quality has dropped as noted by others the concierge service was pretty substandard and their is no food service in the hotel.

While there is both a thermostat and a fan unit of some sort in the room itself, nothing we attempted caused a change to the room temperature. When we went to the front desk to inquire about the in-room air conditioning, which is an advertised amenity on the hotel website, the clerk behind the desk advised that it was 62 degrees outside and ""it would be stupid to be running the air conditioner."" Her appalling lack of customer service and inappropriate conduct aside, it doesn't take a great deal of wisdom to determine that the outside temperature does not necessarily dictate the temperature of an interior room, on the fourth floor of a large hotel. I made several phone calls attempting to reach a manager both that evening and the following evening, was told each time that a manager would get back to me shortly and I never received such a call. What was ultimately ""explained"" was that, despite their advertisement to the contrary, the hotel runs on one, old pipe, so, it's either air conditioning or heat or nothing at all for everyone in the building at the same time with no variation or individual room control. We were offered another room; however, given that there was no air circulating anywhere in the hotel, the room change made absolutely no difference.

I was overly impressed that whenever I needed something, they truly were at my service. Made life a lot easier when I was in NYC for business and needed to have certain amenities and services. I stayed 6 nights and at first didn’t have a mini fridge. I asked and they delivered. I also had a very important package delivered - my wedding dress - and it was well taken care of and I didn’t have to worry. I lived close by when I lived in NYC a few years back. The area is perfect and easy to get to all the transit options. Being so close to Central Park and Columbus Circle are a plus and not far at all away from Times Square but far away enough from the craziness. I was upgraded and my room had a nice view from the 14th floor. The room was large for any standard let alone New York. The room and bathroom were stylish. The hotel did a nice renovation. The bed was huge, King size, and plush. Wonderful to sleep and felt rested. The area wasn’t very loud at all. The staff is great, absolutely professional and friendly. I really loved my experience and would highly recommend. Only a couple of inconveniences: no restaurant on property. There is a cool lounge for drinks though. They also do not offer room service. These are not that much of a problem when there are many options close by. There are great convenient stores/delis next door if you want a less expensive option for wine, breakfast or lunch.

Typical for an older hotel, the air conditioning/heater was very loud and kept me awake at night. Room was freezing when I arrived and no extra blankets in the room.Walls are thin... luckily I was at the end of the hall and nobody beside me but I could easily hear the room across the hall.There were several things that I assumed would be available that were not. Now it's on me to check but I travel a fair bit and usually these things are.There is a bar but no restaurant in the hotel. This means no in room dining! I'm a social person but sometimes I like the option or eating alone, in my room. There is no mini bar in the room, no bottled water, no coffee machine. Because the location is good, there are places near by where you can buy super expensive water, drinks and take away for your room (Starbucks on corner). After having travelled, the very least I expect is a bottle of room temperature water!I bought a bottle of wine to enjoy in my room one evening. There was a tiny ice bucket but no cork screw... I called the front desk to have one brought up to my room and was told because there was no in room dining, there was no cork screws! But the bar would open my wine if I took it to them. The bartender happily did so but it was an inconvenience.The first day I arrived there was no bath matt, the final day of my stay there was no hot water so I was forced to take a cold shower!Seeing that what I consider the basics are missing and the hotel is still pretty expensive, I wouldn't stay here again.

However, location is the only positive thing in this hotel. It starts with a broken mattress and the process of changing it. Then, they don't clean the rooms as any 4 stars or even 3 stars hotel. I believe they don't vacum as some breadcrumbs from previous nights still there. Also, the sheets are never changed no matter how many nights you stay ( I stayed for 4 nights). The staff is not friendly despite the long wait to ask simple question in the reception. Also, I never met the concierge as they work for short hours.

We chose this based on location mainly and very happy with our stay. We arrived to a lovely receptionist who was friendly swiped our card and gave us information on WiFi and our room cards. There are only 2 lifts which on 3 occasions were either busy or 1 out of order I had to walk up 11 stairs one day which wasn’t the best Our room was spacious, the bed was amazing comfiest ever queen size! We had a side street view, sometimes noisy at night with sirens and cars but we were always that tired from the day we would fall asleep straight away. Shower was great and what I loved is that they have a bath in the room which you rarely get in city hotels it was nice to get in from the day and relax in a hot bath! Room was always cleaned daily fresh towels and bedding and friendly staff.Hotel is close to everything; subway, Central Park on your left, Times Square on your right. Food places all around and bars. In the room is a ice holder and down the hall is an ice machine which we used for water and drinks in our room. We used the market on most mornings, fruit cup, yoghurt and croissant will cost around $12. Starbucks next door is cheap for morning drinks. On our last night we gave the hotel bar a try, cocktails are $15 excluding tax & tip 3 drinks set us back almost $50.. We bought New York passes before arrival and picked them up down the road just before Times Square which I would recommend if it’s tourism your going for and for a week+ gets your moneys worth out of them!

I'm a military veteran and had just graduated college; my commencement ceremony took place in New Jersey and we decided to spend the rest of the weekend and Monday in NYC to celebrate. First the positives... hotel was nice, very conveniently located in midtown and offered easy access to many subway stations, restaurants and Times Square (which is literally just down the street). Room was clean, we had our own private bathroom and the staff was generally very pleasant (with the exception noted below). Unfortunately, I was caught by surprise by the ""mandatory"" facilities fee; this is disclosed to you upon check-in and I was forced to have $150 debited from my card before even receiving my key. What were we to do at that point, cancel the reservation and try to find another room in the middle of NYC on a moment's notice? I had made the reservation weeks in advance and felt we were stuck either paying up or finding a bench in Central Park to sleep on. Their notion of ""mandatory"" is, in my opinion, fraudulent practice and an easy way to bilk guests out of more money regardless of what amenities they use. I don't know if this is just the way hotels do things in NYC in general but I was not prepared for it. Unlike many of their guests (presumably), we are not extremely well off, even booking this trip really strained our budget to begin with. But we wanted to do it because we love NYC and hadn't been there in years. We did not use a single extra amenity during our entire stay - we used the room to sleep, shower and dress before going out into the town, that's it. Upon checkout, I asked the clerk if there was any flexibility on that mandatory charge since we literally didn't use anything and she rudely replied that its mandatory, no exceptions. So this hotel basically took $104 from me in exchange for absolutely nothing. Regardless of whether or not this is common practice with NYC hotels, in my world I call that stealing. Furthermore, the ""amenities"" described by their disclosure are mostly things that other hotels simply include in the nightly rate (i.e., fitness center, parking, use of computers, etc.). We didn't even use the hotel's wifi. I paid nearly $800 for our 3-day stay only to be charged another $100+ for absolutely no reason whatsoever. If we had used any of those things, fine - but we didn't. Yet it is still somehow mandatory. This facilities fee is a complete scam. Perhaps those guests who are a bit more affluent aren't bothered by this but folks like us who stretched our budget quite thin already in order to experience a much more comfortable stay in NYC are getting ripped off it. I left feeling very aggravated and disappointed overall with this hotel. It put a damper on our enjoyment of the city overall and those extra charges prevented us from doing a few of the things we had wanted to do while there. I feel that charging for extra services that a guest actually uses is fair, but to charge them regardless simply because somewhere it's hotel policy that it be ""mandatory?"" Theft. Plain and simple. They took money from me and for things I or we never used or even touched. It should be illegal, this policy. Should we ever go back to NYC this hotel will NOT be on our list of places to stay. We will find someplace that doesn't bilk us out of additional money in exchange for nothing.","Tampa, Florida",1,2.0

The hotel location is great, near to subways. Definitely a good hotel for those who likes to venture the city.Cons: Service is way below the average, receptionists were unwelcoming. Honestly, I feel that the service staff at the concierge and guest relation counter did not go the extra mile to help the guest, for example when I was standing at the empty guest relation counter, the conceirge staff was just there at his own counter pretending not to see us. We did not expect him to serve us but atleast just acknowledge our presence or to assure that someone will be assisting us soon.Twice on different occasions, we were being directed from one counter to another just to receive our parcel from amazon that were being charged for handling fee per item. (There is no information and clause on this. We ended up paying US$50 just like that. If we have known, we would have asked the deliveryman to call us directly instead)And this may sound surprising but for a big hotel like Park Central, I have observed and experienced myself that different guests were being treated differently in term of customer service. As long as you look asian or tanned looking, you will not be treated equally like other guests, which is very disappointing.Overall, I was happy with my one week stay in New York but the service experience of the hotel is definitely not my top five. It would be a waste for a nice hotel like this to be tarnished by staff that are not well-groom with customer service knowledge and skills. Whether a guest is wearing a well tailored suit or a baggy t-shirt with bermudas, all guests needs to be treated fairly.","Singapore, Singapore",38,3.0

It's just that in the same price range, there are so many hotel choices in mid-town Manhattan, and so many that are better in many ways.First, there is a lot to like about the Park Central Hotel. The property is centrally located to all things mid-town. The theaters, Central Park, Times Square, Carnegie Hall, and several museums. The property is very well maintained. The public areas are newly appointed, modern and accessible. We had a room on a lower floor so I can't comment on views, but I can say an interior facing room is quiet, unlike what I imagine with street facing rooms. So, we appreciated the quiet. As with the public spaces, our room was also very clean, upon arrival and after every day's housekeeping.In one way the Park Central Hotel was a standout. Service. We were guests for four nights so we had many occasions to interact with a variety of staff. To a person they were helpful, professional, accommodating, informative and simply nice people. And I'm referring to housekeepers and maintenance men on up to the desk agents and managers we encountered. The staff is well trained and it seems like they enjoy working at the Park Central Hotel, or at least they don't hate it to the point where guests suffer from their annoyance with management.The reason I wouldn't consider the Park Central Hotel for a return visit seems down to management actually. Or at least management policies and practices that directly impact guests. When we arrived we immediately noticed the room lacked several amenities one would expect at this price point. There was no coffee/tea maker, no refrigerator and no self-service food/bar items. And the ice maker on our floor was inoperable upon our arrival. To their credit, the machine was quickly repaired.Also, several lamps were missing from the room. There was a reading chair, but no accompanying reading lamp. And there was no reading lamp on the bedside table of one of us. I immediately requested a coffee maker and lamps. The coffee maker was delivered immediately. The reading lamp came the next day. It took quite a bit longer to get the bedside lamp. Only after requesting it several times, and after the personal assistance of a maintenance person was the lamp delivered. We learned that lamps are often broken and thus swapped around from room-to-room. I put this issue down to management not supplying a sufficient numbers of lamps and not keeping sufficient replacements on hand.The other troublesome issue that I also put down to a management practice is the ""mandatory facilities/resort fee"" of $31.00 per night. For the mandatory fee guests receive:1. Unlimited domestic phone calls2. Unlimited use of the nearby 24 Hour Fitness Center3. Luggage storage upon early arrival or late departure4. Use of computer workstations in the lobby5. Daily USA Today newspapers6. Printing, scanning and faxing available through Guest RelationsRather than comment on these ""amenities"", I'll leave it to the reader to determine if there is value in these items.Room service is not available at the Park Central Hotel. This was the most surprising deficiency.","Oakland, CA",85,3.0

On the final day we were able to leave our luggage in storage after checking out as we had a late evening flight.The room was very clean, comfortable and a good size. We were on the 3rd floor and there was a bit of noise outside during the night, but hey ho, we were in New York, what do you expect?Checking in was a bit slow and the staff weren't very welcoming but we were pleased to be able to get into our room even though we arrived a few hours before the official check in time. We asked for a fridge which never came but there was an ice bucket in the room and an ice dispenser outside in the corridor which was quite satisfactory. Many people mention the facilities charge which does feel unfair when we are told there is ""free"" wifi. However, we factored this into the price when we booked and the actual charge ended up being less than expected. Overall I was very satisfied and would return and recommend it to my friends.","Guildford, United Kingdom",55,4.0

I would have never booked this place if I had the choice. The hotel on the outside and the inside look visually appealing. It looks like a nice hotel. It's when you settle in and start looking closer at the hotel when you start to see the problems. The checkin person wasn't rude, but they also were not nice/welcoming. The checkout person was much nicer. The elevators were small and slow to operate. I wasn't in a rush, so it didn't bother me much, but it was still an inconvenience. The room: when I walked in, I initially felt pleasantly surprised at how nice it appeared. However, when I opened the closet door, there was a soiled towel on the shelf. It was still wet. There was dust and debris all along the baseboards that were both visible to the naked eye and visible when standing. The floors were dirty all over and it immediately made me worry about my belongings. This was the first time I've ever felt an urgent need to protect my luggage from pests/bugs and the hotel environment in general (above and beyond how I normally protect my stuff when traveling). I sealed everything tight and put it all in the tub hoping that nothing got in. The air conditioner also did not work at first, but after a call to the front desk, maintenance came and fixed it. All in all, I wanted to like this place because it looked really nice, but I was left with an overall sense of disgust and some worry.

We immediately reported this to management and filled out appropriate forms and were told luggage room footage would be reviewed. Despite approaching staff several times, nothing was sorted before we left and the security team said they were not permitted to tell me what they found on cameras.

A very short walk to Central Park, 2 mins from 57th street subway station, numerous restaurants and an easy walking distance to 5th avenue. Of all the places we visited in NY it was our ideal place to stay, in the heart of everything, easy to access the whole city via the subway but also away from the bustle of Times Square and other more busy areas. A simply perfect location. For us personally, being located right next to Central Park was a priority and you can wake up and run round the park each morning as a perfect start the day. If not run, you can walk or cycle (bikes for hire) and just enjoy the beauty and atmosphere of the park. The best bits:Amazing location! See above. The rooms are very clean, the housekeeping staff are very efficient. All staff are friendly and helpful.Rooms are very comfortable- large comfortable bed, large TV, clean adequate bathroom and decent shower, overall very clean and well maintained. Wifi is accessible everywhere in the hotel.Great selection of Diners and other food options very close by. We liked the diner directly across the road (Park Cafe) best for a quick breakfast or lunch - fast service, good value and decent American style menu. Views of Central Park (however you must pay extra for a street facing room).Great gym facility in the hotel.Central Park is a 5 minute walk and has everything you'd expect. It has a dedicated running and cycling track if that's your thing and endless footpaths for walking. A great place to start your day or simply escape the hustle and bustle of the city streets. To be aware of: Upselling - The daily room rate advertised is not the total price you will pay. They add taxes plus facilities charges of $31 for each night you stay. Make sure you book and pay for a street facing room, or you will face internally into a block and see no natural light and the room is dark. The upgrade fee for a street facing room is approx $40 per night but worth it. If you arrive before 4pm and want to check in to your room, you'll be charged an upgrade fee for early check in at approx $61, again worth it if you've been on a long flight and want to shower and freshen up. They do offer a bag drop service also to store your bags if you are happy to wait.The hotel is approximately 1 hour from JFK airport, approx $55 in a yellow taxi. There is a lot of traffic on the way, be prepared with water and snacks if you've come off a long flight. There are no fridges in the room but you can request one. Stock up with water and other drinks at a shop nearby.There isn't a coffee machine in the room either but they sell coffee in the shop downstairs in the hotel lobby and there's numerous coffee shops close by.

There is no restaurant attached to this hotel, but they do sell snack & pastries in a kiosk. Good diners close by for breakfast and good restaurants for dinner. The bar/ lounge is nice but the prices for drinks are very expensive, forcing us to drink elsewhere.

Super close to Central Park and subway. Walking distance (or 2 Subway stops) from Time Square. Close enough to enjoy but far away enough to avoid the craziness. You can access the 57th Street Subway Station without leaving the block.Cleanliness was good enough. Location and cleanliness were my priorities when searching reviews prior to booking hotels and this lived up to the reviews I viewed.Lovely bathroom with really hot water and a shower plus bathtub. Superb Wi-Fi which was heavenly for contributing to a great holiday: easily able to locate venues and services, book tickets, checkout opening times…When I had a problem with the bath plug, there was a service man there within minutes. He said they work 24/7. Extra glasses and towelling were not a problem.Included: iron and ironing board; Hairdryer; Reasonably quiet air conditioner.Fairly quiet for sleeping. There were the regular sounds of sirens and car horns, intermittently, but only a few times in the week were they really loud. We were on the 7th floor facing the street – so all in all, pleasant. Fabulous lounge behind the foyer. Good for getting away from the family. Booths for eating in if desired as the rooms were a bit too small for all of us to eat in.Considering you are in the heart of the city, the room is really well organised and quiet.Minuses:No fridge or any coffee making facilities in the rooms. If you and those with you like a couple of cups of coffee a day, be prepared to purchase from cafes or the many Starbucks nearby. Could not keep any leftovers from meals or have something as a middle of the night snack.A microwave for general use would have been great on many occasions. While there are decent pull down blinds, these did not completely block out the bright lights of outside well enough for me. I only slept well when I was wearing my eye mask.In regards to the lighting within the room, there was definitely not enough. Only a couple of lamps and a faint picture light. Not good enough for reading unless you were right under one of the lamps. Luckily we had a window with some natural light during the day.A gorgeous bar but way too expensive: almost $15 each for a small glass of red (after tax and gratuities). It’s no wonder it’s mostly empty. (There’s a lovely little liquor store diagonally opposite the Starbucks downstairs that sells great wines, some between $15-$20 a bottle.)","Sydney, Australia",18,4.0

The location is very good between Time Square and Central Park and is handy for a number of Subway stations and a good selection of bars and restaurants. Got a very good headline rate for the area, however this did exclude the facilities fee (although I did get a couple of emails highlighting this) even with this added the price was still fairly good.Arrived mid evening to discover that the room (king size) which I had booked a couple of months earlier was not available although I was offered a twin queen with the facilities fee waived, which softened the blow. The room itself was pretty good, had a view of an internal court yard, which while initially disappointing was probably a blessing in disguise as it was free from the usual NY chorus of taxi drivers sounding their horns! There were no facilities for making tea or coffee in the room (not sure if that is the US norm?) and there was only a little shop in the hotel for drinks and breakfast. The lounge is very pleasant with excellent staff, they are missing a bit of a trick not doing food, particularly breakfast, which even the ropiest UK hotels will have a go at, and after a hard day doing the sights one or two quiet evenings eating in the hotel might have been nice.All in all I would recommend Park Central if you can get a good deal, but wouldn't recommend paying over the odds.","Woking, United Kingdom",8,3.0

Our overall impression of the hotel with its correct and professional, but not always friendly, personal and staff is very positive. We had a room on the 9th floor at the hotel backside. Consequently our view below was a kind of inner court (roof of hotel spaces) with hotel installations on top of it. The installations made a monotonous noise, but we didn’t consider that as annoying. The room with perfect beds and many wall sockets was spacious enough and was perfectly cleaned daily. The same counts for the bathroom with a shower in the comfortable low bath, that made it easy to get in. A point of improvement is the poor lighting in the rooms.The location of the hotel couldn’t be better. A subway station is around the corner and at about 400 meters there is the south entrance of the Central Park as well as the Columbus Circle subway station with many main subway lines. Attractions like Times Square, Museum Mile (incl. MOMA), 5th Avenue Rockefeller Building and even Bryant Park and the Empire State Building are at walking distance (if you like to do some walking). The Circle Line Cruises at the banks of the Hudson river is also at walking distance getting you through the Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood with some nice restaurants, which are much cheaper than restaurants near the hotel. To get to other neighbourhoods/ attractions like Coney Island, DUMBO / Brooklyn Heights, 9/11 monument, Brooklyn Bridge, Lower East Side, etc. the nearby subway is perfectly suited. By the way, we bought the NY Explorer Pass online and built our own attraction pass which worked perfectly (skipping the ticket lines!!). Two final remarks: (i) the hotel breakfast, if you booked it, is just 'grab and go';(ii) at arrival 300 dollar is put on hold on your credit card and refunded 4-5 days after checking out (we had never experienced this at a prepaid trip)","Nieuwerkerk aan den Ijssel, The Netherlands",26,4.0

The location is very convenient to go to many places, near to a few subway stations. The hotel is clean and big (as compared to other hotels in nyc).However, there are some negative points for the hotel.1) there are 2 lifts but they can take very long to come down. We have to take the stairs for a couple of time as the wait was long and lift was full. 2) One of the last few nights, we actually didn't ask for housekeeping and put a do-not-disturb at the door knob. However, our room was cleaned despite putting the sign. Yes, it's nice of them to clean but there's a reason why we left the sign outside in the first place. 3) Housekeeper cleared the plastic cups and didn't replace it with new ones. The body shampoo was emptied but not refill throughout the stay. 4) Almost one month after checking out, we realised that our card was charged with a fee. We were told at the reception that it's a refundable hotel deposit. Insisted that we have to use a credit card instead of cash if not we'll need to put a larger amount of cash instead of the original amount. During the last night, we received a piece of paper that said credit the amount, so we assumed that it's the refund of the money. Until a month later, we noticed that our card is being charged and there's a fine print that said we agreed to pay some facilities fee (though nothing was being signed). We felt cheated since we were unaware of the facilities fee and nothing was mentioned; other than the deposit for the hotel. It's not a small amount, 30usd per night, which can total up to be about 270usd for our 9 nights. I think it's about being honest and informed correctly.

I had very little time to unpack and freshen up before heading to dinner and the theater. Therefore, on my way out I explained the problem to the front desk and was expecting to see a lamp in place when I returned in the late evening. There was no lamp.The next morning, Friday, August 11, I telephoned Guest Services from the room while preparing to go out for the day to inform them a lamp had not been delivered. They apologized and assured me a lamp would be placed in the room. Upon my return in the late afternoon, a lamp was still missing. The message light flashing on the room phone was from Guest Services. They wanted to confirm the delivery of a lamp and make certain everything was to my satisfaction. Frustrated, I telephoned Guest Services. They were surprised to learn a lamp had not been delivered. They assured me they would send a lamp right up. A few hours later I again received a call from Guest Services to confirm delivery of a lamp. I told them that a lamp had not been delivered and asked if there was another Room 1010. At this point I was extremely furious, as I had waited for delivery and missed getting a quick nap before showering and going out for the night. I was now told a lamp would be sent up as soon as one became available. Became available? I told the representative I had checked on-line and there were available rooms from which they could have an available lamp. I also stated that housekeeping should have noticed the missing lamp and reported it when the room was being prepared for my arrival. I would presume the duties of housekeeping is to ensure all furnishings are present in a room and functional.After this conversation, there was no further communication with Guest Services. This saga shows a lack of professionalism and organization within the hotel. Who is telling whom a lamp has been delivered? Who is responsible to ensure a guest’s request. I wrote a letter to the hotel, but to date have not had a response. I frequent this hotel and absolutely love the location to my favorite restaurants and the theater.

The hotel was in a great location and was really a great place to stay. Check in and check out was very quick. The front desk staff was very professional. Elevators were quick. There is a small shop to purchase a quick bite to eat in the lobby. They also had a huge bar in the lobby. The room was clean, bed was very comfortable, bathroom was a good size, shower was big and water pressure was great. The offer their toiletries already built into the shower to use (similar to how a cruise ship does), rather than the standard little bottles. The only small bottle you get is lotion. We heard no noise from the hallway or other rooms. Our room had no view other than the rest of the hotel rooms windows. Seems to have been built in a courtyard/atrium type of configuration but with no outdoor area. They do have WiFi, but you also pay a $32-$33/day resort fee for that privilege as well. I think a lot of NYC hotels and other big city hotels charge this feel anyway. The only thing that we felt was a little off was the lighting was very dim in the room. Not a big deal if you're just there to shower and sleep, but if you're there to do any kind of work it would be a problem. There isn't any type of lamp on the desk where you would be working either. Just two lamps, one on each side of the bed. This wouldn't deter me from staying here again, but it was just something we noticed.

We've always liked it (which is why we kept going back). But the current situation leads me to decide none of us ever will again. I used the website on Aug. 23 to reserve a room for myself, Sept. 6-13. The rate was $177 per night, plus the usual taxes etc. I didn't get a confirmation, so I phoned and left a message about having one sent to me by e-mail. No response for a couple of days, so I phoned again. After a runaround, being switched from one office to another, being promised a call-back that never came, I finally got some information. Apparently, Reservations had booked me for a stay on Aug. 23, and made no record of the Sept. dates that I actually wanted. Then they marked and charged me as a no-show for Aug. 23, a date on which I never wanted to stay there -- in fact, the date on which I made the reservation from my home on the West Coast. They agreed to cancel that. Because they had neglected to reserve the room I wanted for a week in September, they were willing to make that reservation now -- at a charge of more than $320 per night. I remonstrated that the reservation I had made and they messed up was at the much lower rate, and the answer -- put very politely, but in effect meaning: tough luck.If this is their idea of customer service, that I should pay through the nose for their error, I want none of it for myself or my family in the future.",Vancouver,2,1.0

Yeah, a while ago, but I copied this from a review I made on another site. I was on the 11th floor room 1153 (I think) it was a corner room with a view of 7th avenue. I managed to get a good deal (with breakfast) on Expedia for about £95 a night (a steal, wow) a four night for three night deal. This hotel was in an absolutely perfect location. It was a five minute walk to Central Park (hence the name) and a ten minute walk to Time Square. If I hadn't been there with my teenage daughter I probably would have stayed in the Soho/Greenwhich area which is more my style but I enjoyed the buzz of this area. The hotel was very smart and the room we ended up with was big, clean and spacious with a view of 7th Avenue. The bed itself was also very, very comfortable. We were originally given a room facing some inner square looking opposite other bedrooms but after a quick word with the receptionist we were switched to a room with a view.Online it listed breakfast as continental so I was not expecting much. In fact it was a full and very tasty breakfast with bacon, eggs, pancakes and lots of fresh fruit and yoghurt. The breakfast room was bright and airy with huge windows with a view of the New York streets lined with yellow taxis. A perfect start to the day!!The staff around the hotel and in the breakfast room were really nice and polite. The rooms were also cleaned adequately every morning to a high standard.My only criticism is the lifts were VERY slow. Being on the 11th floor this was quite irritating. We were told by reception they had installed some new system which gives priority to people going up but it seemed like they forgot about the people going down! We soon worked out you have to press to go up for the lift to arrive (sometimes empty) then when you are in you hit the ground floor button, crazy I know!! I wonder if that is now fixed.

While we have a usual hotel we book, this time we discovered that the Park Central Hotel was a little bit cheaper, and a whole lot swankier than where we usually go, and since we’d be celebrating my birthday while in town decided to try it out.I’ll be honest, having read the reviews here just prior to departure to NYC I was a bit nervous about my decision, but I have to say that I didn’t experience the major issues other reviewers have note.The hotel itself is very nice, with a large open concept lobby and a big open lounge/bar area behind reception. The staff are friendly enough, but we did find the person who greeted us at reception to be a bit short and wasn’t offering the friendliest of welcomes. We also discovered upon checking in that there was a $31(USD)/day “resort facilities fee” we would be required to pay - why this wasn’t simply included in the price I’m not entirely sure, but it did mean that when all was said and done we probably weren’t saving that much money by staying here instead of our usual place. It should be noted the website we booked on did mention this fee, but it was listed in a sidebar and easily overlooked - again why it wasn’t simply included in the price, I’m not sure.Checking luggage wasn't an issue, both on the day we checked in and the day we checked out. In fact, the nicest staff we encountered was in the luggage room.The rooms are quite nice - we had a room on the 8th floor by the elevator with two queen beds. The room itself was pretty spacious, with enough room for the four of us and our luggage. Despite the proximity to the elevator, it wasn’t noisy. The beds were very comfortable, with excellent pillows (sometimes a rarity in hotels). The bathroom was quite spacious, and the shower nice and clean. We didn’t have much of a view, in fact our room looked directly at the office building opposite us. The rooms don’t feature a minibar/fridge so if you get leftovers you won’t be able to save them for the next day, but there are ice buckets if you need to chill a beverage. There’s also free WiFi, which is always nice, though in 2017 is somewhat expected. Perhaps the only major annoyance about the hotel are the elevators. There’s only two of them and they are slow and they are small. Expect to wait. There are stairs, and being on the 8th floor meant it wasn’t too much of a hassle to just walk downstairs if we got sick of waiting (but wouldn’t exactly want to have to climb them).There’s a small little store downstairs that sells sandwiches, fruit, pastry and beverages, albeit at a fairly inflated price. You’re likely better off going to the Starbucks that is basically right next door.The reality is we were here for the location, and the price. The hotel was a place to sleep, and it was more the sufficient for that purpose, especially with such comfortable beds and pillows. You are literally steps away from Carnegie Hall, and minutes away from Central Park, Times Square, and Broadway. In terms of location, it’s pretty much perfect, but you can probably find a place just as convenient at a better price.","Markham, Canada",36,4.0

By the end of or stay - we couldn't wait to leave this hotel. Please take heed of ALL reviews here - as these are accurate and I wish we paid attention to more reviews rather than focusing on the positive reviews. I can imagine if you stayed for one or two nights - you could have a positive experience but our whole experience left a lot to be desired and the least positive by far out of 8 X Hotels we stayed in across the country. In the beginning....Check in experience was cold and impersonal - like most interactions we had in NYC - I can deal with this but when we got to our room after a full day traveling things went downhill...Our first room was on 7th floor - We made a few calls and laid on the bed to relax for a few minutes - this is when we noticed the NOISE from 7th Avenue - I figured the window was left open. Went to close - nope it's closed already. With 5 nights booked for this hotel - this was not tenable! We immediately went to 'Hotel Services' to complain and request a different room... They seemed surprised that we thought it was noisy - surely we are not the only ones to complain about this!? They commented that NY was a 'big city' and we should expect some noise....come on! I bet they wouldn't pay money to sleep in that room. Eventually they were accommodating but informed us they couldn't change our room until the following day...which was better than nothing we figured....Well that night I literally had no more than 2 hours sleep total. The street noise (cars, trucks, sirens, buses etc) was beyond a joke, I cannot over emphasize this enough - but what what took the cake was being able to hear a full conversation between 2 X people at 4am from our room from street level. Needless to say this ruined my next day due to the serious lack of sleep. Thankfully - the next day our room was ready by 3pm (we effectively checked out and in again) and this time was on 12th floor - facing the courtyard. No problems sacrificing a view to avoid the street noise. This room was much better, but only relatively speaking. We still had to deal with the sound and vibration from the room above us - think opening scene of Jurassic Park with the water rippling in the glass as the T-Rex approached. This literally happened. No cell phone service in room either. To be clear: I'm not a noise freak - but have never experienced a hotel like this, EVER! It was like a 4D amusement ride - not the good kind. The bed was terrible, my side of the bed sat at a downward angle like the springs were completely shot. Further to this - The room was tired and fittings were shabby - the toilet roll holder was broken and ignored by housekeeping daily. The fabric used in the bathroom makes the room almost impossible to keep clean. The elevators are ridiculously small and slow. Imagine the cartoons with the 50 x clowns getting out of the single clown cars!! Allow 5-10 minutes to get to the lobby. We requested a fridge - we were given one within about 2 hours of requesting - which was useful. Probably the most positive aspect of our experience! As for the location - which admittedly is good/central but bear in mind this comes with lots of tourist foot traffic. But it is NYC so this comes with the package. But - If I ever stay in NYC again, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on location as the NYC subway system is awesome and so cheap/easy to get around Manhattan (once you get your head around how the lines work and uptown vs. downtown etc). Finally - the 'Resort Fees' - absolute joke! This is simply a way for hotels like this to appear cost effective on the booking sites. We learnt our lesson on this twice on our trip, thinking our prepaid visit was all inclusive.... We got caught with another hotel with this 'tax' but honestly had no problem paying for it in Vegas given the quality of the hotel, room, amenities and staff at the Venetian.

My only complaint was that they charge $33 USD per day for resort/hotel fees for things that were basic in virtually any hotel, including basic or budget hotels. These things were use of phone, computers, baggage hotel and use of gym ( for which only 3 out of 100 people use the front desk man told me, who uses a gym while in NYC anyway, you walk so much there's no need or time!. Or if you have a gym it should be pay per use. There were no restaurants, bar only opened at 5, no extras in the room such as mini fridge, coffee maker, etc.. And forget using their little snack bar in the lobby as it is outrageously expensive. Just step out the door and get your snacks anywhere for much less!

Arrived at the hotel at approximately 11pm. Initial thoughts were positive based on the location of the hotel, with Times Square in our sights. The hotel is situated in the main artery of Manhattan between Times Square and Central Park so it's ideal for first time travelers to experience the hustle and bustle of New York City. As we walked in we were greeted by a very stoic faced receptionist. Being used to over enthusiastic greeters in most of the hotels I've stayed at, I have to say this was slightly underwhelming. However she processed us through fairly quickly and were unpacking before we knew it. The room itself is clean and the beds comfortable, but not much more than that. The views out of the room were shocking, facing a brick wall and other rooms on either side. Not great when the room adjacent to you has an old man who has no issues getting changed in the full view of the general public. However given that we just needed a bed to sleep on this did not bother us too much. Do not buy from the tuck shop in the lobby. Prices are massively inflated, charging $7 for a bottle of water, I hope the water was sourced from the Himalayas itself. I am not surprised the USA is undergoing a massive health and fitness crisis with those prices. However again given the location there are grocery stores nearby who thankfully do not sell goods at extortionate prices. The gym was okay, fitness gurus would be screaming at the lack of barbells. Frankly you're better off getting a 2 hour cardio bike ride in at Central Park every morning.It was raining on the Friday, I was surprised that the hotel did not have any umbrellas for guests but you can purchase any amenities nearby. Again it didn't help having another receptionist who was not helpful.Room service woke us up once, however in fairness to them it was 9am and we didn't have a ""do not disturb"" sign on our door. So make sure you get the door signs if you're not an early bird.I think this is the main takeaway from this review is, it's a decent budget hotel with a great location. Would I stay here again? Probably, but better customer service could work wonders for this hotel.",,9,3.0

I was emailed back almost immediately both by Melissa from the team and the director of guest experience, Mr Hightower, offering a free upgrade to a Preferred Room and assurance that the girls would be looked after. The fruit basket was gorgeous, but more importantly, the girls had a wonderful time, were given the utmost of attention and couldn't rave more about their stay.

It was a long weekend break from the UK for my partners' Birthday and our first time in NYC. The really big selling point for this hotel is the prime location - a short walk away from both Times Square and Central Park with excellent links to MTA. The hotel is well presented and the decor smart and modern. Staff were polite, friendly, helpful when required and efficient. The room was really spacious - but the bathroom a little on the tight side - and clean, well equipped and generally smart to the eye. The bed was a big plus - paid a little extra for a big double but, boy, was it worth it! Soft, comfy, big pillows and more sleeping space than I think I've ever had. As a base to explore for three nights it was perfect - the adjustable air con was a plus in August. Good Wifi once we got the right info - and that was really the only niggle, there was no guide to the hotel and it's services available in the room, meaning we had to ask at concierge/reception a lot, e.g. Wifi instructions. But we always got a helpful answer so no real issue there. All in all a really great location that helped make a memorable weekend.",,2,4.0

Upon arriving at the hotel, it was quite impressive, nice entrance and lounge, this is as far as our good experience goes unfortunately.We left our bags with the storage room as check in wasnt until 4pm. We returned at 4:00pm, lined up as everyone else did and was told our room was not ready until 4:30pm and to wait in the lounge and someone will come and get us when it is ready. No problems, we got a drink and waited. At 5:00pm I hop back into the line to get an update, and was told she needed to speak with the manager. Approximately 30 minutes later she comes back and says there is a problem with one of the beds in our room. She says she can give us an upgraded room to a Junior Suite (a room on the 18th floor) with 1 king bed and a fold out sofa which is the same size as a queen. I said no problem, we will do that and please give us an update on our Time Square Room which we had paid for. We got given complimentary breakfast at this point (which was only a pastry or fruit and a drink). Went up to room, was not happy with the 'upgrade' as it really was just a fold out sofa and a normal bed. Went back down to reception to let me know we were ok to take that room for the 1 night, however we were not happy to have that room for the entire 4 nights as it is definately not what we had paid for and was a limited view of time square also.The following day, I went to the managers desk and was told there was a room, however we would need to hold our bags in storage, come back at 4pm again and re check in. Said thats fine but we really only have 4 days in New York and we had already spent so much time wasted on this room issue. We got upstairs and started packing when I got a phone call to meet the manager on the 12th floor to see if a room was good to move to. At this point, we just wanted 2 separate normal beds to sleep on. Got to the room, even more limited view of Time Square (legit no view), a king bed and a double bed (we were supposed to have 2 queens) and later realised there was no fridge, no hair dryer, and no body wash left. The manager did advise that he would be waiving the facilities fees for the stay. In the mean time, I had called Laundry services to enquiry about getting our washing done, and they advised me there is no service on the weekends, however if you are wanting just wash and dry (no dry cleaning) that is complimentary and can be arranged at 7am Monday and dropped off at 4:00pm that day.So I called the reception on Sunday night and asked for a hair dryer, body wash and for someone to pick up our bag of washing at 7am. Again I confirmed with them that it was a complimentary service as it is not dry cleaning. I woke up at 7:45am and had to call again for someone to pick up our washing. Someone arrived and advised that the bag of washing would cost a substantial amount, to which I replied no it is complimentary. She very bluntly advised there is no such thing and this bag would cost a lot to have washed. I asked for the bag back and proceeded to call a manager. The manager I spoke to was extremely rude, kept talking over the top of me and challenged me to come downstairs to have ""this conversation"" with him face to face. After being extremely frustrated and shocked with the disgusting treatment we have had to endure over the 3 days of our 4 night stay, I hung up and was in tears for the rest of the day. When we returned that afternoon, a fridge had been delivered to our room (completely too late) and the pump the conditioner bottle was jammed so we couldn't use it. By this point, we had had enough communicating with the staff at this hotel, so decided not to even bother asking for it to be fixed.Upon check out, the only staff member who actually treated us with some-what respect, Nancy checked us out and could probably sense that we were seriously not happy. By this point I was drained, as the entire experience had really affected my trip. She said sorry for our experience, by that point I just wanted to get out of there.We were on a trip with approximately 10 other people, and ended up spending time at the Novatel Hotel at Time Square. We didnt spend any time in their rooms, however they have a roof top bar with the most amazing view of Time Square. After all, thats the whole reason why we came to New York and booked with this hotel for that view, so next time we will be staying there instead.","Adelaide, Australia",5,1.0

It was a nice and comfortable hotel, with a good situation. I paid a little extra for a higher floor, which was worth it I think though I was facing away from the park, so perhaps not as great a view as it could have been!The staff in the bar were very friendly and chatty and gave that 'authentic american bar tender' view you often see on TV and in films.There were a couple of things that didn't make my visit great though. There was a 'compulsory' facilities fee I had to pay, which they say covered the costs of using the fitness suite, and the business centre etc. As I had no intention of using those, I felt quite conned. Surely, if it's compulsory and everybody has to pay it then it should be included in the room rate. If not, then people should only have to pay it if they actually want to use those facilities. It just ends up making the price look more attractive to get you to book it.The front desk staff were not the friendliest. I went to the Concierge desk to ask a relatively convoluted question. After I had asked, the staff member just said, oh i'm not the concierge, I work the front desk I'm just waiting for my colleague to finish' and wandered off... Never mind...There was no restaurant which seemed a bit weird, but plenty of places to eat nearby. The $1 breakfast was acceptable, though only filter coffee, so I couldn't have decaf. I was hungry one morning and went for another croissant which cost me nearly $10...Overall, it's a nice comfortable place to rest your head. Don't trouble the front desk staff and budget an extra $30-$40 per night, and you'll be fine.","Cardiff, United Kingdom",13,3.0

Unfortunately, my husband and I were less than impressed. Park Central is very much a no-frills hotel, which would be fine except that they charge a $35/night resort fee that does not include anything more than what other hotels provide for free (wifi, fitness center, and business center) along with some services that might only be of value to international travelers (free local phone calls from the room). There is no bottled water in the room (free or for purchase), no pen, no note paper. No nothing. We purchased 2 beverages in the market downstairs, a Coke and a lemonade. $9! My husband walked to Duane Reade to purchase water. The room was very poorly lit and showing signs of wear. The toilet paper holder was broken and the paper was just hanging off of one working side. Instead of calling maintenance, I decided to see what would happen if I pulled the roll off so housekeeping would have no choice but to notice. Housekeeping put the roll right back on the broken holder! There was a stain on one pillow case and I took the pillow off of the bed and placed it on the floor, stain prominently showing. Housekeeping put it back on the bed! The paint on the walls was chipping and the carpet had lots of light colored stains. I did not feel comfortable taking my shoes off. Also, at all times in the day or night, if the street noise from our 11th floor room was not enough, the hallway was extremely loud, with every sound and conversation traveling into our room. For the positives: The bathroom was otherwise clean and the water pressure/temperature was good. Location was great for walking and also convenient to several subway lines. The front desk staff seemed indifferent but the concierge staff was very friendly and helpful. Based on this experience, I would not return to this hotel. ","Atlanta, Georgia",85,3.0

There's a nice variety of restaurants, souvenir and other shops nearby. Tour buses and subways are just steps from the front door. The hotel updates are attractive and very comfortable. The staff are exceptional from the front door to the concierge to housekeeping and maintenance staff. Two suggestions for the hotel. I was with a group staying there, and we all liked the hotel but commented on the poorly positioned lighting in the bathrooms which makes it difficult to see for shaving or makeup application. Lights over or beside the mirror are needed. An extension mirror with a lighted frame would be an inexpensive interim solution. There are no refrigerated mini-bars in the rooms to keep medications, etc. The $75 per day cost to rent a small refrigerator was prohibitive, and the ice buckets were poor insulators. Fortunately the staff found a way to freeze the cold pack for me for the next leg of my trip. Refrigerated mini-bars are suggested which help pay for themselves and accommodate the medical needs as well as the convenience of customers.Despite those concerns, I'd stay at the Park Central again and recommend it to others.

After reading some mixed reviews, mainly centred around the extra charges, I was a little worried about the bill but I needn't have been. we paid up front through the site and it was confirmed on there that the extra charges (tax etc) were included, but it's always a worry when you read other people saying that they had a bill pushed under their door on the last night. Yes, we did received the bill this way but it was for $0 so was very happy! There is also free wifi included, which was excellent and they also have macs down in the reception with a printer so you can go and use those for free too. This was helpful for printing out our boarding passes for the return flight. The room was immaculate and such a great view (12th floor, room 1209) and the maid kept it lovely and clean for us throughout the stay. There is also a free safe. There was no restaurant, but this didn't matter as there were far too many to choose from in the city. The bar area and lobby was always immaculately presented and very swanky. The lifts are key card activated, so you put your room card/key in the slot and you can then choose your floor. This is great, as it makes you feel secure but to be honest as there is always someone in the lift you could inadvertently pick up a hitch hiker :( There isn't really anyone ""on watch"". The lobby toilets are also a little disappointing, as there are only three and there was such a queue for them on our last day (we'd already checked out and handed our key back and needed a key for accessing them).

However... the NOISE! The rooms seriously need white noise generators which I've seen in other NY hotels to drown out the outside noise. The hotel is in a very busy area, right next to central park and the Carnegie hall, 5-10 minute walk from Times square. 7th Avenue is a gridlock of traffic 24/7, so outside, day and night is honking horns, shouting and general city noise which is frequently loud enough to disturb sleep. The walls are super thin too so you can have a chat to your next door neighbour should you wish to. This is especially delightful when someone arrives from a different time zone at 3am and has a little welcome party in their room with their friends. (yes, this IS British sarcasm)For such a lovely hotel I was surprised by the lack of mini bar, fridge and coffee maker in the room, also by the lack of white noise option and very limited lifts for such a large hotel. A small single cup coffee machine was supplied on request though.The bed was seriously THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and as someone who suffers with back pain and almost never finds a comfortable bed this is really saying something. I booked a twin room for my son and I, and we were given a good sized double queen room which looked out over the side street.Overall - It has its faults, but for location versus price I think this hotel is unbeatable. No serious complaints other than the noise and the long wait for lifts, which is tiresome, but I would stay there again.","London, United Kingdom",16,4.0

The size of the room is good enough for 3-4 persons and at most 1 extra large luggage & 1 carry-on luggage. Needless to say, the room is too small if you're travelling with more persons or bags other than what I've mentioned. Although the size of the bed is large enough to fit two persons comfortably, there just isn't enough space in the room to move around in and place more bags in the room. However, the size of the hotel room is typical for a hotel in Manhattan so it was all right.The bed was particularly comfortable and made for a good night's sleep after walking the whole day. The water pressure in the shower and sink was also excellent, and there were no issues with the water heater. The shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided by the hotel were likewise wonderful to use. The hotel's location couldn't be better as it is right in the middle of Manhattan and just a couple of blocks away from Central Park, Times Square, etc.Just one other thing to note aside from the tiny room is the fact that only 2 elevators service the whole hotel so expect to wait 5-10 minutes to get an elevator at peak times. For some reason, the other two elevators are not in service.

I booked it and I have to say, I was a bit scared! I even brought my own towels because one review said they didn't have enough. However, my experience was really great. The hotel rooms were large for NYC standard. I had a room with a King Size bed. I had a ton of towels in the room. I also read that the maid service was lacking. I was on the 8th floor and my cleaning team did a great job on my room. The shower was powerful with lots of hot water. So, let me just call out a few things that are just realizes of the hotel. No coffee maker in the room but there is a Starbucks like ten feet from the front door of the hotel. Also, the elevators are historic, meaning they are not large and it doesn't make much to fill them, and there is a short wait during peak times. I would say my excellent hotel rate and all the pro's outweigh the cons. You have to decide for yourself if coffee makers and the elevator warrant you wanting to pay $$$ more.

I had booked a hotel room for Friday the 23rd so we had a room ready when we touched down in the city. I had specifically asked to notate my account saying we were coming in at 6am. We arrived to the hotel only to receive a somewhat cold Good Morning. I chalked it up to being in the city and it was early. I gave the desk clerk my information and she asked us to give her a minute. She walked away and got the manager. The manager proceeded to tell me that my hotel room wasn't ready because I was a ""no show"" on Friday for checkin and that there were no notes stating that I would arrive on Saturday at 6am. I told the manager that this was totally unacceptable!! Why would I purchase a hotel Friday then???!!! Duh! The manager said she could put us in a temporary King room until my double queen room was ready and comp us for 3 days of breakfasts. Mind you there were three of us traveling. We went to the king room this is what we saw:-small doorway to bring in luggage- king bed took up the entire room barely could walk around it-no wash cloths -room was very warmThe desk clerk told us someone would call my cellphone when the room was ready. I didn't receive a call however someone called and left a vm on the hotel room that I couldn't even check. I tried calling the front desk and it went to their sister hotel. At this point I was very upset. We finally got our double room and was upgraded to a ""premier"" floor. Don't let the name premier fool you there is nothing premier about it. We were assigned a room on the 12th floor right off the elevator facing the brick buildings behind us! Wow what an upgrade! Here are the pros and cons of this place:Pros:- 2 blocks west of the Central Park- 4 blocks from the heart of time square- tons of souvenir shops- 2 blocks west of the famous Brooklyn diner- 3 blocks from the big bus city tour stop- next door to two coffee shops including Starbucks Cons- rooms are extremely small even premier upgrades- service is poor- no hotel restaurant bar only- market is tiny and very expensive- rooms are hot and uncomfortable - elevators are super slow- restrooms on main floor need a room key only- room keys lose magnetic strip easily had to get new keys multiple times - facilities fees are $31 a day on top of your room rate and triple tax you payAll in all I probably would get a hotel that is in the same vicinity as this one but would spring for something comparable in price to get more service and a better experience.","Seattle, Washington",1,2.0

Upon reading some of the previous reviews I did wonder if I was in the same hotel! I found it clean with helpful staff when needed, saying that we did only use the hotel as a base as we were out from late morning to evening doing things all over this amazing city. One downfall we did encounter was the darkness of the rooms, especially the lack of light in the closet space, I had to use the torch button on my mobile phone to see which numbers I was pressing on the safe! We had a room on the 18th floor at the rear, away from the street noise which was ideal. We did ask for the use of a coffee machine on our second day, which duly arrived ten minutes later with a supply of coffee, which wasn't too bad either. We purchased our breakfast from the coffee and snack bar in the lobby most mornings, ideal for a very tasty muffin, fruit and coffee before heading out to do battle on the busy streets, not cheap though, about twice as much for the same at the Starbucks two doors down the avenue, but a much nicer place than the cramped Starbucks if you ate it in the lounge area!We only used the bar once, let's just say it wasn't the cheapest two beers we had in the city, but you're in New York, so it was no surprise to be honest.The luggage storage facility in the lobby on our last day was a godsend as we weren't flying till 10pm, so we were able to check out then go out for the day and come back to use the toilets and change before being picked up by our shuttle driver at 5.30pm, beware..the shuttle drivers we had came from the loony school of driving!Overall, I'd happily come back here, ideally located for all the midtown sights, a five minute stroll up to Central Park, a ten minute walk across to Fifth Avenue and another ten minutes walk down to Times Square.

Fantastic deal. When I checked in they told me they had no more King rooms available, which is what I booked. The lady at check in said she'd upgrade me to a better room, and comp the $31 resort daily fee for internet/gym/etc. Fine by me. I was given room 426 (I think) and when I got there the A/C wasn't working despite being set to 67 degrees. It was hot. The room also had one window that faced the interior brick corridor, and the bathroom was the size of an airplane toilet. Seriously, if you stood in the shower you would bump into the walls. I asked for another room and was promptly given 1628. Same interior corridor view, but the bath was 3x the size and most importantly - the A/C worked great. Had small issue where the sliding ""barn"" door to the closet was only hanging on with one wheel (the other was in the closet on the safe) and also the conditioner pump in the bath was not working. I called maintenance and they fixed the door while I was at work, and left me 3 bottles (shower gel, shampoo, conditioner) for the bath. I didn't need all that, just wanted the broken pump replaced on the conditioner, but ok. Minor complaint... no small fridge in the room. I just kept filling up my teeny-tiny ice bucket for water/soda. Also couldn't connect to internet for some reason. Kept saying room # wasn't correct, despite double checking with front desk that my room 1628 was the one listed. They connected me to their IT people off-site and they ended up linking my IP address so I would automatically sign in without even having to log in. Bed was very comfortable. Room was pretty much 2x the size I'm used to in NYC. Loved it. 15 min walk to Times Square/Broadway shows. Easily accessible to subway, cabs were always right outside too, even in rush hour. Clean rooms. Big flat panel TV, shower/bath has 3 large pumps of shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The only tiny bottle is the body lotion. Elevators were fast in comparison to other hotels in the area.

The hotel was great. Location perfect. But being charged $200 for bellman gratuity was over the top. The bellman offered to help us with bringing pizzas for 100 kids (admittedly a lot!) to one of our rooms. We declined as there were plenty of us to carry them. The bellman insisted. We finally said ok, never suspecting we would be charged a ""gratuity"". My colleague tipped him to boot. They tried to pass a $200 ""handling"" charge from room to room. I disputed the charge with guest services. I found out the outcome when I received my credit card statement. ARGH. When our business office requested the folio the charge was listed as 'bellman gratuity'. That's not my idea of a gratuity!! Since then I've contacted the hotel and the ONLY response is to complete a form to have another credit card charged. I find this extremely unethical. Yes, I agree to pay hotel charges, but 1. There was no indication we would be charged for the bellman's offer of assistance. 2. When I disputed the charges their only response was to charge my credit card without notifying me. 3. The hotel has been unwilling to have a conversation. 4. Charging for a ""gratuity"" (their words, not mine). A gratuity is a gift. 5. We gave them considerable business.

Also, when making my reservation I was promised a bunch of perks including a $10 Uber credit, no one has answered my inquiries on how I am supposed to receive this. Not really a huge deal to me, but I'd be very cautious of booking one of the packages that includes more expensive perks like parking or meal plans.

It's a large, older hotel, but one can tell that it has been thoughtfully updated & remodeled. We stayed 4-nites on the 11th floor, & then due to a flight cancellation after ✔️-out, stayed one more nite in the 10th floor. The rooms are modern & clean, the beds were fairly comfortable with plenty of pillows, soft sheets & duvet. The bathrooms were sparkling & well-lit with fluffy white towels (not too thick, not too thin...just right :) The shower heads were fun* with plenty of water pressure. (*a shiny rectangular ""rain-shower"") Not being a morning-person, I totally appreciated having the extra ceiling light in the bath&shower area. That, + the shower head made for a happy-start to my day! The rooms also had PLENTY of outlets...We had 2-ipads, 2-cellphones, my personal hairdryer & flatiron, (along with the room-provided hair-dryer), etc. We were able to charge several devices @ the same time, while simultaneously using the hair-appliances. I didn't give 5-stars because there were a few minor annoyances. Even tho the rooms had been updated, the edges of the wall2wall carpeting was frayed, & didn't quite fit flush with the wall. (providing a visual of lint & dirt that conveniently fell into those open-spaces....not so cool) Also, the large ""floating"" mirror in one of our bathrooms probably needed 2b replaced....several chipped areas around the edges.. I lived all if the outlets, altho in one of the 2-rooms we stayed in, most of the outlets didn't work....(they ALL worked fine in the other room)Other than those small gripes, the location was perfectly placed between Tumes Sq, Central Park, the theatres, Rockefeller Ctr, and....a very big plus for me (as a sometimes solo female-traveler) several ""very-close-2-the-Hotel"" subway stations. One more thing: I cannot say ENOUGH good about the PCH-staff. Every single employee we interacted with was EXTREMELY friendly & more than helpful (luggage storage/front desk/room attendants/lobby bar/bell-men etc) We didn't have time2call re our small complaints, tho I believe if we had, the PCH would have made those issues better4us. In summary: moderately-priced, $250+/night/Standard K & standard dbl, nice clean rooms, & extremely well-trained & accommodating staff.

I was told by several friends that the concierge would happily assist with getting tickets to shows or tours, so after checking in, we went to speak with her. The only thing she was willing or able to assist with was selling us a NY Pass and sending us to an obscure place to purchase ""left over"" cheap Broadway show tickets. After getting up to the room and pulling back the sheets to the bed, we were shocked to see stains on the bed sheets! The first phone call to housekeeping said it would take 45 minutes to change them. I then called the front desk and told them this was unacceptable and I wanted it done now. After an hour the sheets where still not changed and I asked to speak with a manager and was denied because they were in the process of taking care of my problem and doing their best. The next day I noticed something gross on the inside of the shower curtain and asked for that to be changed as well...3 days later, it was changed for a shower curtain that wasn't long enough and it barely grazed the top of the bath tub allowing water to fall into the floor when you showered. Again I was denied when asking to speak with a manager. When I booked the room and a phone call made the day before our arrival, I notified them that our anniversary was at the end of the week and I wanted something special in our room to surprise my husband. I was assured they would ""take care of it"". As you can guess by now, there was NOTHING special...AT ALL! The LEAST they could have done was to leave some mints on the pillow with a special note like ""Happy Anniversary!""...Again, disappointed.This hotel is not worth the money they charge. There are too many hotels in the city to waste time with this ""4 Star"" hotel that only deserves 2 stars at best.Good things about this hotel are that it's close to Times Square, Central Park and the Subway and it's a place to lay your head at night.

I will say they seemed to have all available front desk staff assisting with check-ins, but the line still snaked through the lobby. There was also a bit of a line to check luggage. I understand this can happen with a large quantity of guests checking in and out, but it might not be something guests will think to budget extra time for, so be aware you might wait a little.The hotel is just steps from the 57th St subway station (N, Q, R, W), which was very convenient.Park Central Hotel will be on my list of options when I return to NYC, not at the top of my list, but not a bad option.","Atlanta, Georgia",82,4.0

I ended up with two beds instead of the one King which was fine but the room was small for the beds and I found myself questioning if it really was an upgrade. The room was kept very clean and neat. I found the air conditioning unit, which was one of the old school unit, very loud and difficult to get the temperature right. The other disappointment for me was the lack of customer service. In general it felt more like a factory with a ""get them in and get them out"" sort of feeling. The only time I got some help was when I asked a bellman for a recommendation for a restaurant since the concierge desk was always too busy or not staffed. The bellman was very helpful and friendly. I also needed to store my luggage since I was unable to get my room for the hour and a half longer past checkout time that I needed.

I was well accommodated and running the fan from the AC unit did a great job drowning out the city noise allowing me to sleep better than expected. The room was clean (other than the odd odor from the room deodorizer), the bed and linens were comfortable, and the seating area was a nice convenience. I did wish there were amenities that allowed me to make coffee or tea and ended up running the tap to warm up water for tea that I fortunately bring with me when I travel. It got the job done. There is a bar in the hotel, which I did not take advantage of, there is no room service or restaurant, however there is a small market with pre-made salads, sandwiches, drinks/coffee, and wine - open from early morning until 8 pm.

The security to get to the other floors was excellent, and though we were a little slow to find out that our key was required for the use of the elevator, it all worked out and this was great! One thing that would have helped was a microwave/fridge in the room. Not sure if it's because it's an older hotel, but with all of the ample portions and treats we could access on our trip, we had to leave the leftovers behind due to a lack of storage. With prices a bit higher than at home, any special help with this would have been a budget-bonus. A fridge could be requested but being put on a waiting list didn't get it to us before the end of our stay. While we didn't use the bar services nor the small deli-type area, the waiting areas by both the bar as well as the lobby was very spacious, with many seating opportunities and outlets to recharge electronics (bar area).

For me, that meant I was holding very long working hours and in the hotel room emailing/working for a lot of my time. That also meant I needed full use of the amenities available to me. The big one missing was room service when I didn't have time to go get food. They weren't super helpful with any unique requests and didn't even try to accommodate.I don't expect a doorman for a mid-range hotel, but I do expect that a hotel with so many frequent travelers to try and go the extra mile. Other than the awesome bellhop and good housekeeping, service was just so-so.This hotel is great if you are not planning on spending time here. The rooms are a decent size, the showers are hot, the blowdryer isn't a flimsy travel size, and the bed is comfortable (though the pillows weren't my favorite).

Big thanks to all of you, contributors. This is where you start your trip from eagerly reading reviews of the hotel you are about to book. First, you sift through the latest reviews (Is there something happening recently you should be aware of? Construction? Bed bugs? Mystery murder? Kidding!). Then you enjoy those good reviews - nice location, rooms of decent size, good service, Wi-Fi in the room! And finally carefully check the bad ones - noise outside, rooms small, service inattentive, Wi-Fi too expensive... So why would the same size room be considered small by some and of decent size by the others? Why some people rave about the service in the same hotel while the others find it unacceptable? May I suggest that so often this is our perception of reality conditioned by the expectations? The human factor.I was fortunate to have stayed at many top five-star hotels, among them a few in NYC. I also knew that Park Central wouldn't offer some of those top hotel perks - this is a four-star one. My expectations were realistic - I knew there wouldn't be a Nescafe machine in the room or fridge with minibar, no bathrobes or sleepers, and no turn-down service, we needed a place for a good night sleep, no frills, and yet - a decent place deserving those four stars. I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was spacious, the room design modern and stylish, gray and white colors dominating, clean lines. Two double beds with comfy mattresses and down comforters, four pillows to your taste, nice linen. TV set with good quality of picture, we were able to connect our iPad to the HDMI input and watch some YouTube movies via the channel 38 using the hotel Wi-Fi. Nice bathroom of acceptable size, satisfying shower, modern fixtures. On our next day stay the room was cleaned diligently, shower parts wiped dry, and the maid even left a thank you note for her tip - very classy gesture. The gym in the hotel was modern, of decent size, good machines.Hotel is just steps away from the central park. Starbucks at the corner of the building, our favorite breakfast place Le Pain Quotidien just a block away toward the park, Subway sandwiches across the street, and the subway station right in the corner. Yet, not too close to the Time Square and its craziness. Perfect location!Overall, the hotel fully met our expectations, and we had good two-night sleep stay. Oh, and did I mention we had it as an unbeatable deal on Travelzoo that set me on a happy note from the beginning?! Human factor, I told you!As for the wishes to make it a better place, I'd say the cheapest and the quickest addition would be a bottle of drinking water in the room, or just make it as a one time complimentary feature, handed out during the check-in.

The location is wonderful. The rooms were clean and a pretty good size for NYC standards. There is a very nice bar that we never wasn't open around 5. The staff was extremely nice although there were some issues with the front desk. No complimentary coffee or ability to make it in the room. Two big ""bewares"": There is a facilities charge that is pretty hefty. We're told that it was for wifi, the gym, and for keeping your luggage for before or after you have your room (something I've never paid for other than a tip to the porter). $70 in addition to other another services charge. Also, we arrived about an hour before check-in. The room wasn't ready but we did all the paperwork. We were told to just come back, show your ID and get the key. When we arrived back there were 15 people in line and two people behind the desk both of whom were helping one person. We waited 20 minutes in line. There was a lot of grumbling in line because of the wait, so we found out that about half the people in line had already checked in and just needed a key. Finally, my husband asked for a manager who wasn't very helpful and also not very quick to arrive. After she spoke to my husband several other people did appear to check people in and hand out keys. It was very frustrating, and obviously a huge flaw in the system. Just put someone behind the desk who is there at 4 pm to hand out keys to people. Not that complicated. To add insult to injury we received a text telling us that the early check-in fee (???) was being waived for us. Good thing because even though we may have checked in early, we didn't receive a key until a good 30 minutes after check-in. We are frequent overnight visitors to NYC as we don't live that far away.

The hotel's location is absolutely fantastic and the staff treated us very well. I came with three friends and we arrived early, fully expecting to just see if we could drop off our luggage and come back for check in, but they let us check in right away and upgraded our room without us even asking (no charge!). The room was more spacious then any room I've stayed in and the cleaning services were really good. It was so nice to return to super comfortable beds in a nice clean room after a long day of walking in the city. I was also struck by the lack of noise-- I couldn't hear anything on our floor (the 8th floor) from outside or even from neighboring rooms, despite being in such a central location. It made for some very restful nights! Also, I was pleased with how quickly the staff helped with requests. I sprained my ankle right before arriving and had to soak it every night so the staff brought a bucket and a bath bench to our room for my use as soon as I explained the situation to them. I didn't even ask for the bench so I thought that was a nice touch. Additionally, they gladly held our bags for us on the last day as we had a late flight out of the city and allowed us to wait in the lounge to rest and charge our phones even after check out. Overall, I was very impressed with every detail and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit NYC. Bonus: be sure to try the cafe right next door for breakfast (Tisserie).

I've previously stayed at The Paramount and Hotel Edison so I had high expectations for a Midtown hotel. Check in was quick and easy although the member of staff spoke far too quickly for me to understand and asked me to sign a waiver the sole purpose of which was to agree to the Resort Fee (more to come on that). The lobby was spacious and the bar area was well presented although the bar isn't manned all the time so we couldn't get a drink in the afternoon. The room we stayed in was one of the biggest I have stayed in in the city. It was clean and well presented. The slight criticism I had with the room itself, which I tried to feedback upon checking out, was that both the shower and hot tap in the bathroom took about 10 mins of running to properly heat up. Housekeeping team did a fantastic job with the room every day. The elevator situation was the most annoying aspect of the hotel (more annoying than the Resort Fee). It only served 3 floors (different elevators for different floors) but 2 were not enough. We regularly waited as they were full and they were unreliable and didn't stop on the floor we were staying. Now the resort fee. We were honestly 100% aware we had to pay it so it didn't come as a surprise but unless you go to the gym, you are paying to use wifi. There was not an option to turn it down. I think it is an added charge so they can appear cheaper on price comparison hotel sites which makes me feel it's a dis-honest act. Wi-if was patchy at best. No streaming for Netflix though. In 2017 should wi-if be a chargeable extra?Overall although clean, spacious and in a good location I have been left with an overwhelming gut-feeling that we wouldn't stay here again.","Manchester, United Kingdom",3,3.0

I will preface it by saying that we were very pleased with the rooms we were eventually given. BUT...Checked in after an early flight. We had booked two king rooms at the Premier Level and requested they be on the same floor. Were told we could be side by side if we gave up our king beds. We declined.Upon returning to the hotel, we were told to wait in the long check-in line again. After reaching the counter, our keys were issued. It was then we discovered that one of our premier king bed rooms had been swapped for a double. We explained that we had already discussed this at morning check-in and had declined.After consulting with the manager, the counter attendant gave us keys to rooms on the eighth floor, the lowest floor considered ""Premium"". We went in, spent a few seconds staring through the windows of the office building 25ft away and called the front desk to arrange alternate rooms.On the third try the manager met us in the lobby, we were given rooms on the 16th floor with a decent view of the city. One was ready, so we dropped our luggage there and made a run to the store. Upon return, we inquired as to the other room and were told that it was ready, on the EIGHTH floor. The manager eventually straightened things out, but wow, what a ridiculous struggle.To top everything off, when we arrived home we discovered they had put a $200 hold on our credit card for ""incidentals"" which no one had ever mentioned. When we questioned the hotel, they told us the money would take up to seven days to be returned to our account.

I asked her to give us a great room if she could w/a King bed and told her it was a special birthday/engagement surprise. She gave me the best room in the building, with 2 bathrooms and a lovely elegant suite, looking out beyond the city scape! My fiancee was beyond thrilled that he could have his own bathroom! He didn't have to look at my toiletries and could take as long as he wanted in the shower. And he did! She also gave us each a drink voucher for the lounge and the bartenders were outstanding! These were long term professionals 20 yrs plus, who knew how to mix a drink! WOW! It was sublime, and we patronized this bar/lounge more than several times. Ms. Elizabeth even gave us the courtesy of calling up to the room to ask if all was satisfactory. I went to many upscale Historic hotels through our visit to NYC, Boston, & DC, and no one treated us so special and important as this lovely lady, a gracious epitome of what customer service & guest relations mean. The stay was the best we had in 3 cities and 10 days, and we continued to talk about how we missed this fabulous hotel and personal treatment. Very clean, and quiet, huge suite, attentive, and wonderful space in the lounge to hook up your computer and relax. A tremendous value especially if you book with a Groupon.

Also had no issues with leaving our bags for an extra 9 hours after we checked out as we had a late flight home.The room was large, very clean (maid service very good, cleaned every day). Only down side for me was not an overly powerful shower, but that's pretty standard for hotels to be honest!We had booked through a site that paid our facilities fee for us, so we didn't have that extra cost at the end which made it even better value. As others have said, the lifts were a bit annoying - having to put your key card in just to get to your floor, which when you have squeezed several of you in, isn't great!

The desk staff and concierge were very helpful. The room was larger than many NYC rooms and nicely outfitted. We were disappointed by the $30-something per night facilities fee, which is not tagged into the price but rather added in taxes and fees to the total cost--especially since we had no need for the amenities it was to cover. I'd rather have had that be just a part of the regular price. We realized after it was kind of cold for a few nights that our window was crooked in its frame, leaving a crack for cold air and noise to get in. A facilities person, who was very nice, did his best to wrestle it in line but it was still off. I had a package delivered to myself at the hotel; the communication over that was not the best.

I had a bath and fixed shower, there was no lower shower for hair washing and plugs would not go down in the bath or basin. The maid service was of high standard, staff members extremely polite and hard working. The lifts in the building were dreadful - small and having to use an entry card to press your room number to go up in a crowded lift was often problematic. Reception staff were average in customer service, not overly friendly but ok. The luggage store man was polite and helpful. And the man who helped us get out suitcases into the taxi. The hotel shop was extremely expensive, nothing price tagged so you get a shock at the till, $5 for a small bottle of water. Pastries and cakes also expensive.

Normally, the hotel charges a $30 to $31 per night wifi, etc. resort fee but his was waived under the Travelzoo Special deal. We had never stayed north of Times Square so we did not know exactly what to expect. However, the hotel is within walking distance of Times Square at 42nd-44th Street and to Central Park and Lincoln Center. Plus, there is a subway stop right around the corner.Our check-in was fast and easy; they had a room for us at 2pm, ahead of regular check in at 4pm. Our room was on the third floor, room 323, and it faced the center courtyard room top that housed all of the heating and air conditioning fans, etc. We were not concerned at not having a view of NYC but were happy to have a quiet inner room. Also, one nice thing about being on the 3rd floor is that the fitness center was just down the hall.Bathroom. As we entered the room, the bathroom was to the immediate right. It was bright, had a large lighted mirror, a modern sink with plenty of counter space. The shower had a modern shower head by Kholer and the tub was sparkling. The shower was easy to adjust. The body wash, shampoo and conditioner are in containers on the wall over the tub and there was a nice large shelf in the shower for other toiletries. One thing we noticed and mentioned to our room attendant was that a lot of lint and hair had lodged into the back of the hairdryer. It need to be cleaned or replaced. We only used the hair dryer once and it worked OK but seemed to generate less heat than expected, possibly because of the extra lint clogged into the back of the hairdryer.The room had a king bed with a fantastic mattress. We had one of the best night's sleep we have had in a long time. The sheets were bright white and crisp; and the pillows were just right. We were pleased that the room had adequate lighting with a desk lamp, two night table lamps, and a hall light. We had to have a couple of items adjusted when we first arrived. First, there was no coffee pot or coffee. We called the housekeeping and a coffee pot, paper cups, coffee, and condiment packs were delivered fairly quickly. We were told that since the hotel has so many rooms, the coffee pots are only included in the room upon the request of the guest. Good to know. The second thing we noticed upon checking into our room was that only one of the night tables had a lamp. Again, we called housekeeping and a lamp was brought to our room that matched the other night table lamp. The hotel seems to solve problems quickly to please the guests and we were impressed.The fitness center on the 3rd floor was large and well equipped. It had several treadmills, elliptical and bicycle machines. Plus, it had two yoga mats, a full set of free weights, three benches, and other work out equipment.The lobby was clean, bright, and efficient. Behind the registration desk is a large lounge with a bar. You don't need to buy a drink to enjoy the lounge.The wifi was fast and was included free for us because of our Travelzoo special rate. Normally, the wifi is included with the $30-$31 resort fee.We would stay at the Park Central again. However, it is unlikely we would stay if we could not find a special deal that waived the resort fee because we feel that it is rather high. For us, we feel our stay was excellent but, I am rating the hotel only as very good because the resort fee is excessive for other guests that may not have been fortunate enough to have it waived.","Baltimore, Maryland",337,4.0

The receptionist was incredibly rude and was not understanding in the slightest. She asked whether I had that in cash. Who carries $5,000 in cash??!! I had to plead with them to put a $1,000 deposit down for the room and the woman shouted at me saying ‘You have to pay by 3pm tomorrow otherwise we will kick you out of the room’. Our 8 month old baby crying his eyes out at this stage but none of the staff seemed to care on bit about this, they were completely heartless and the hotel needs to properly train their staff to be far more considerate and understanding, really really rude!!! The room is basic but ok, what you would expect from a hotel really. There was a dead bug in our babies cot but they did change it, but again it needs to be looked at as they should not be giving out cots like this. I must say the conceigre when we left was very helpful organising a taxi for us and some of the staff were helpful, but the whole experience at the start of the trip put a slight dampener on the whole thing and put us off coming back here again. And NEVER GET ANYTHING FROM THE SHOP IN THE RECEPTION, THEY CHANGRED ME $8 FOR TWO CANS OF COKE AND EVEN TRIED TO CHARGE ME FOR HOT WATER TO WARM BABY MILK FOR OUR BABY WHICH WAS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE DESPITE BEING A HOTEL GUEST","Northampton, United Kingdom",12,3.0

After having a quick nap I went to explore ny to find out it was pouring rain and the hotel did not provide umbrellas.In my previous hotel there was always an extra one in the room I asked the door man for a taxi and jokingly mentioned I wish I had his umbrella where he surprised me and pulled a small umbrella from his coat pocket and gave it to me.This was amazing I then found out that my flight had been cancelled due to bad weather and I was in the hotel for an extra night . Quimby Hightower at guest services organized my extra night and a late checkout so I didn't have to panic. But I have to get back to that amazing doorman his name is Carmelo I returned his umbrella to him and then asked him if he could arrange transportation to the airport the following evening .He told me not to worry even though it was his day off he took my phone # arranged a taxi cab and texted me to let me know it was all done .I am one of thousands of people who stay at this hotel but these 2 individuals made it feel like home.I go to NYC twice a year and I look forward to seeing their friendly faces in the springtime .Sofia Ladhari ,"Vancouver, Canada",1,5.0

If you are looking for a hotel that is clean, nice rooms with good beds at an affordable price, in a great location close to Carnegie Hall and Central Park, it is a hotel to consider.My wife had a concert at Carnegie Hall. We checked into our room that was provided to us by the production company on a Wednesday. She brought with her another 140+ people who were part of her group that stayed at the hotel.On Thursday and Friday the group my wife lead had 3-4 hour rehearsals at the hotel. The hotel could not provide water for her performers because they have no services at the hotel. This was not ideal and was an issue we had to solve without the hotels help.On Saturday the day of the performance at Carnegie Hall my wife and I were locked out of our room the production company provided us. I came back to the room in the afternoon and the key did not work. I went downstairs and got another key. It did not work. I went back downstairs and the manager met me to say she had purposely given me a key that did not work because she wanted to talk with me. The issue was she stated she did not have enough contact information for us listed on her record. Now, the production company reserved our room and paid for it. We had been guests at the hotel now for 4 days. There are ways to communicate to hotel guests other than making their key not work. Leave a message at the desk or on our room phone is a suggestion. When I voiced my disapproval on how she was working with me. She turn around and left me. Please hotel, get your management education on how to deal with guests. After standing there for a few minutes not believing what just happen I went back to the front desk and ask for key that would work. Now, I never gave the manager any updated information on our room because she never stayed long enough to talk with me or ask me again. The person at the front desk told me security had now unlocked our door and she could now issue me a key.On Saturday night after the concert, many of our performers keys would not work when they got back to their room at 2 AM in the morning. It seems the keys that were given to us on Wednesday were programed to not work through our stay on Sunday. Again, this is a management issue.To review if you want a fair priced room, good location, that is clean and has a good bed, but no refrig. or microwave, it is good place to stay. If you must deal with the management, good luck. For this reason I cannot recommend this hotel, nor will I ever stay there again.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",2,2.0

Close to Central Park (obviously) and in a great position to see a lot of Manhattan Island. So what's the problem????When I paid up front for my trip I paid what they called the 'total cost'. Unfortunately they have a very different understanding to the meaning of the word 'total'. When we left they also charged us an additional (and obligatory) $224. This is for Wi-fi and Gym...regardless of whether you want to use that. They put this charge deep in the small print, far below the 'total cost'. What was even worse is that when we questioned this upon check-in we were told this was already included in what we had paid...but at the end they had changed their mind. So liars as well as thieves. We had to queue with various other unhappy customers to complain about the issue. It's just extremely underhand - which leaves a really bitter taste in the mouth.

Instead even after confirming with me that I asked for the delivery - I had to come downstairs. Furthermore the hotel's ""luggage/mail room"" is not manned certain hours so if you arrived back at the hotel at 1 am and wanted to pick up packages that were messengered to you - well good luck. The convenience cafe ( they gave no other breakfast/dining options are open for also limited hours. Craving a late night snack in the cold winter? Be prepared to head outdoors. The windows are not double paned and if you're facing the street you will get that whole NYC experience. This is not a problem for me as I'm a sound sleeper but my colleague who stayed next door had the most terrible time falling asleep and needed earplugs. The rooms are basic, clean and well-kept. My hotel experience with the staff was pleasant - my housekeeper was always warm and friendly and the staff was efficient. I just feel that this is definitely a 3 or 3.5 star hotel at most and should declare itself as such. ","Santa Monica, California",15,3.0

The staff at this hotel are five star all the way!Staying in the month of January, we found the prices to be very reasonable for NY, although we do object to an automatic $31 additional ""facilities fee"", since there was nothing special about the facilities it includes, and it is always an unpleasant surprise to think you know the price per night, only to find out is $31 higher. Make sure to look for this fee when pricing your stay.That being said, this is a very convenient and super clean hotel in a great location for getting around Manhattan. It is definitely not a hotel for a special, romantic occasion, but it is great for tourism and business.The lobby of the hotel is gorgeous, with ample seating to consume light fare from the grab and go ""market"" that takes the place of a restaurant. It is convenient if you are in a rush, and the coffee is fabulous. The lobby has the aura of a five star hotel, while the rooms are more like a four star hotel. They are extremely clean and comfortable, but lack the super comfy mattresses and bathroom amenities, like shower caps, that other hotels provide. In theory you can ask for them, but calling and waiting for a shower cap when you are in a hurry to get out is not very practical.The first room we had was on the fifth floor, overlooking Seventh Avenue, and at that level you could hear all the street noises of the city. The second room was on the seventh floor, with the dreariest view of an ugly courtyard with machinery, and rooms on all sides around you. So we closed the shade for privacy and enjoyed the peace and quiet.The room itself was very pleasant and spotlessly clean, which is the most important criteria for us.

Unfortunately, because we used the app, I was not aware of the $31 facility fee until it was too late. Additionally, I was unable to choose my room options and could not get a king bed, we had to settle for 2 queens. Still, all in it came to about 150 .. which is pretty darned good considering the location. The other pitfall of the app was I missed out on the 'breakfast voucher'. Which apparently cost $1 and gets you a pastry and a coffee in the lobby snack counter. I did not book through TripAdvisor, so maybe they have these options listed. They had no restaurant, but there are plenty of options locally. The night of the show, we ate and drank at 'Characters' which is only a few blocks away to the south. The food was reasonably priced, and we really enjoyed it. Before leaving, the next day, we 'lunched' at PJ Carney's pub and they were also a very good deal. Both had great atmosphere. I will try and get to review them separately. There was no view from my room, which was a drag, but other than that its a great place to stay.","New York City, New York",4,4.0

So there are no surprises, there is a $33.75 resort fee that is separate from the rate. (The website does note this.) A two-night Thursday-Saturday stay with the parking deal was under $400. Overall, given location, prices aren't bad normally and parking is $65/night without the package, which is comparable to other hotels in the area.The staff is accommodating and friendly but this is not a 4- or 5-Diamond hotel, so expecting that type of service may cause disappointment.

Well where do I start first of all this was suppose to be a honeymoon we got greeted by a not very welcome receptionist. we then had to take our bags to the room even though other people were being offered a porter. I'm guessing paying £2.700 is still not enough to get a porter. I had emailed ahead and said this was our honeymoon to which I was told we had been upgraded to on of the preferred rooms. Then we arrive in the room just a standard room nothing special at all about it so I wouldn't like to know what the standard rooms are if this was a preferred room. it started off with no welcome pack at all not even phone numbers to ring or anything what hotel doesn't have a welcome pack. Then we notice know tea or coffee making facilities again who has ever been to a hotel and not had that I mean that's pretty standard surely for every hotel. I paid £20 a day each extra for breakfast well if I had know what it was gonna be I woulda saved my money. so we get given these cards for breakfast, we go down our breakfast choice was one of the following;plain croissantplain muffin chocolate muffinblueberry muffina piece of fruit applebanana orangeteawaterorange juicecoffeeThat's it. I'm sorry but that is not worth £20 where is the eggs, bacon, toast. plus if you wanted anything extra like apple juice or a pan au chocolate that was about $5 extra per item.Another issue we had with this hotel is that on our 3rd day it was raining very hard allday so we have come back to our hotel room wet and cold so we turned the heating on to dry our clothes and warm us up but after 20 mins I realised the heater unit was just blowing air not hot at all just normal air. I went down to reception to be told that they don't turn the heating on through the building unless it was below 50 degrees. well what if I was an old couple that were shivering to death nope cant help you can get as much aircon as you want but no heat at all.Then to top it all off you get charged $30 a day for stuff that 90% of people will never use apart from the bag drop.these include unlimited local and domestic phone calls within the usa not internationalunlimited use of the fitness centreluggage storage upon arrival and/or departureapple workstations with printing faxing and scanning.There is no way of getting out of this charge either.The bed sheets weren't changed the whole week we were there which I think is disgusting they should at least change them once in the week. We took our own but the shower gel and shampoo were empty when we arrived so had to ask twice for these to be filled. yes we took our own but they should be provided.The location of the hotel was great right near central park a short walk from times square but that was the only plus we got out of the hotel","Bedford, United Kingdom",1,2.0

A CVS two blocks away, Wells Fargo ATM a block away and plenty of restaurants within steps. The bad: This is a non-smoking hotel, yet a room near us with a do not disturb sign on the handle emitted cigarette smoke and marijuana smoke night and day for days. The hallway reeked of pot smoke and cigarette and got into our rooms. Calls to the front desk and they're saying they'd send security as well as approaching the manager at Guest Relations did nothing to abate it. We were told they couldn't knock on the door to address it as that would be ""harassment."" They could only address it if they saw it. Never mind the stench of smoke in the common hallway. Meanwhile we suffered with headaches and the smoke. We were told the room was unoccupied, which was a joke as we saw people going in and out. When we complained again for the 3rd day, the manager told us, ""the occupants are checking out today."" Our two room party of 4 won't stay here again because the smoking and the lingering smoke that affected us all wasn't addressed. There are plenty of other hotels near here. There is no coffee maker. One must go down to the lobby market for coffee and breakfast snacks. However, there were LONG waits for the very small two elevators. We'd go up in the elevator just to be able to be ON the elevator in order to go down. Get the $1 breakfast deal as this is a huge cost saver. It includes coffee or tea, bottle of water or orange juice. apple, orange or banana, a muffin or croissant.

Near Central Park, a short walk to 5th ave. and Times Square and price. Reserved two rooms – both city view queen. The lay outs were totally different. Room 462 had two queen beds and a full good sized bathroom and the city view did face 7th ave., but the view was of the roof. There are no amenities such as a coffee make, microwave or fridge. Room 426 also 2 queen room had a view of a brick wall and the bathroom was very small with small shower and no tub. Housekeeping didn’t do a good job – it looked as though they left mid-job. One bed was half made, the towels were still on bathroom floor and they left the duster. The rooms were also short of towels on arrival. The beds were very comfortable, clean and quiet. The fact that we wanted adjoining or connecting rooms never made it to the reservation, but they would try and get us on the same floor.The lobby is nicely decorated with lots of seating. It is located behind the check in desk. We had our breakfast there. You can add breakfast when you make a reservation for only $1 per person. We were told that you could have 1 beverage, 1 fruit and 1 pastry. The choices for the beverage were water, coffee, juice and fruits were orange, apple or banana. The pastry choices were limited to muffin or croissant, not much of a choice considering they were out of croissants. The problem with the hotel is hidden charges. Tried to make reservation on line-rooms at $261, but the website wasn’t working so I had to call the hotel and central reservation said they would give me the same room for $290. I told them it was $261 on line he told me then book on line I had told him site was down. After a discussion he connected me to hotel directly. The first person I spoke to couldn’t help, so I was connected to a second person. They said they would match the price but I had to pay in advance. I upgraded room so the price became $272 per night. I requested adjoining or connecting rooms because we had children with us. He gave me the total I gave him the credit card and the reservation was made. Later I went to print up the confirmations and when I read them the prices were totally different. They were $268.50 for the first night and $295.00 for second night plus $32.66 per night per room for a Facility fee. The Facility fee cover things that even the most basic hotels give for free – Wi-Fi and gym. There was no mention of this fee when I made reservation and no mention of a $30 jump in price for second night. I called hotel about discrepancies and they said I paid in advance so tough luck. I asked to speak to manager – not any more help. They said they would do a refund, which I couldn’t do because I had paid for 6 airline tickets based on the reservation and we were leaving the next day. I decided to speak to management when I arrived, but wasn’t able to do so until I was leaving. She wasn’t the friendliest of people. She called (or pretended to call) the agent I spoke with and asked him if he told me about the $32.66 and the higher rate. She told me he said he had, really? He remembered me and the call, I’m sure. I told her that was a bold face lie. She finally said she wouldn’t charge me the $32.66 per room per night, but she wasn’t going to do anything about the room rate.

It is on the corner of 57 & 7, across from Carneige Hall. Our room request when we made our reservations (adjoining) was not granted. ( although our room did have an adjoining door to another room). The taller lady with the tight ponytail behind the counter was not accommodating to anyone. It was almost as if she were playing a control game with the customers. ( "" oh you are requesting a room with two beds? Haha , sorry, we have two rooms on two different floors.) that was an actual conversation I heard her have with the father and son checking in before us. We had to put our foot down to have our children's room close to ours! Bellmen were just standing around with their carts, waiting for people to ask them for assistance. No one was opening the doors for anyone who had their hands full. It is true about the only 2 working elevators, it is a 10 minute wait. We actually got used to taking the 5 flights of stairs. The rooms were simple and clean. No frills. Two queen bed, plenty of outlets,a safe, blow dryer. Charging ports. Tv, our window opened a few inches which we did keep open at night. The trash trucks at 6 am did not bother us. Check out is noon. On our last day, we left for an early breakfast and came back to a room with a deactivated room key!? When I called from my room to ask them to bring up an activated room key for our children's room, they sent up an obnoxious security man who unlocked the door and told me I needed to go get my new key myself, that he was just there to unlock the door?! He really acted bothered and winded. Like it took a lot out of him to take the quick service elevator across from our room. So, I called again and asked them to bring me a new activated key since they deactivated it with all of our luggage still inside and several more hours left. She could not seem to understand why she should have to bring us the key? She never brought us a new key. We took Futurelimo from Newark for $200, which included tax, tips, and tolls. The ride was a Luxury Cadillac SUV. Definitely recommend. The subway entry was at the corner of the building. The Manhattan Club and Westhouse hotel was also attached to the building. We were within a few blocks walk to Columbus Circle, Time Square, Broadway. The subways were not as scary as we thought they would be? It does get expensive but it really gets you there quickly. We just wish we would have figured it all out earlier in our trip. We ate at the Redeye Grill across the hotel which was definitely NOT worth $350.00 for French fries and a fajita skirt steak ( family of 5 without ordering anything fancy). I would not recommend this restaurant unless you are sharing a plate like we saw several young people doing. Park Cafe across from the hotel is perfect for breakfast. It does get crowded but the atmosphere is fun. We really enjoyed our New York trip tremendously. In my opinion, only the workers were obnoxious . The people we spoke with on the subway or on the streets were very nice and so willing to offer their help with directions.I was surprised by the laziness of the employees at Newark Airport. To me, if you are in a position that makes you that unhappy, leave and give it to someone who really needs a job. Yes, there is someone out there who would take it and give it their best.

On arrival I was aware that the check in time was 4pm and joined the long reception queue at 3.50pm. This is later than most hotels around the world and not a welcome start to long distance travellers, especially those travelling from east to west.Once at the reception desk I was told that they could check-in, but I would have to return after 4pm when they could allocate me a room (if one was available). Really? ""Come back in ten minutes and we'll allocate you a room"" was the suggestion. This meant rejoining the long queue and waiting a further fifteen minutes to then be allocated a room. Talk about inflexibility and sticking rigidly to a 4pm check in! Ridiculous.Anyway, room allocated and to be fair it didn't seem that bad with all the facilities one would need. However first observation was the use of the heating system, necessary at this time of the year, was very noisy. My first night was awful. The noise from the street was constant and loud, from sirens to dustcarts deliveries and car horns plus many other distractions. It's certainly time to replace the double glazing and improve the awful noise pollution. I had to ask to move rooms as I didn't sleep all night and judging from the reaction of the staff its a common complaint if your room is on the south side of the hotel.After trying another room which was again noisy, I finally settled for the third room offered which was satisfactory for the rest of my stay.Previous reviews have also mentioned the poor elevator service which is entirely accurate, meaning long waits at the lift entrances both going up and coming down.The hotel has the advantage of a great position for all of Manhattans attractions but my advice would be to choose a hotel away from the heart of the city. Public transportation is so good that reaching the same attractions is only a short subway ride away with the benefit of a calmer and more peaceful night's sleep. (Consider Jersey City on the other side of the Hudson - four metro stops out of the city)Finally the well guarded and not to be mentioned issue (until you check out) of the 'Resort fee', a charge of $32.00 per day which you aren't told about on arrival. I and my colleague specifically asked at check-in if there were any other charges that we would be liable for during our stay. 'No' was the reply. So it's a bit sly and underhand to have an invoice slid under your room door on the morning of departure requesting payment. (In my case over $163.00) Another guest checking out in front of me queried the payment and was rudely pointed out a small notice at the far end of the reception desk with the hotels T&C's including the chargeable resort fee. I'm sure its the hotel's way of advertising lower rates but clawing it back through, in my opinion, an underhand way.I probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again and certainly not at the inflated Christmas prices.

We had been looking forward to this trip for a long time only to be disappointed by the experience at PARK CENTRAL HOTEL. Here is a list of disappointments. On the first night the bar area was closed to customers, which after 9 hours of flying is a massive let down. There are not enough lifts for the amount of rooms, often spend a long time waiting only for the lift to be crammed full. So if you're in a rush to be somewhere in a morning, expect to be late. Wifi is extraordinarily slow, so despite the fact that you get charged $30 PER NIGHT EXTRA it is better in McDonalds. Television choice is poor, if you're looking for anything other than a news channel, then you will struggle. Insects in the rooms - my partner had a nasty reaction to a bite. I expect insects in my room when I'm in a hostel or a motel, not a ""4*"" NYC hotel. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room (surely this would be in the $30pn facilities fee?) Instead you can pay $20 for a tea, coffee, sandwich and a donut downstairs.. (!?!?!?)Finally, the hidden cost. At roughly 7am on our final morning, a hotel staff member very kindly slid a bill under our door for $163 as what I expect to be this hotel's way of saying thank you for choosing them, over the other thousands of probably more deserving NY hotels. After scratching our heads wondering where this 'facility charge' had come from we decided to do some research. So... despite the Park Central staff making ""every effort to make this known to guests upon check in and throughout our stay"" not a single staff member said a word. It is not the fact that I have been billed an extra $163 that is the most annoying, it's the manner in which it was slipped under our door on the morning of our last day in NYC which is the most outrageous, as if the hotel were trying to keep it on the down low, and expecting us to just keep quiet and accept it. Great way to wake up on the final day of your long awaited Christmas trip to New York.

On arrival we were met with appalled service! The lady was very rude and said we have an upgrade in room which yes sounds great BUT we went to the room and there were two double beds which we didn't even need and the room was very small considering we had paid for a large king size deluxe room we wasn't given this! On our invoice it was said our room was on level 8! Well the first room we were given was on level 3 and my other half didn't even fit in the beds they were that small, as well as we just didn't want two beds we wanted one as we booked! So we then went downstairs and asked for the room we originally asked for as this was a downgrade not an upgrade! So she then gave us a room on the 4th floor. She also ASKED FOR A DEPOSIT OF $500! We said we don't have this so she downed it to $300 which is far enough, we were great full for this, would of been nice to have known about this charge though! - We were aware of the facility fee but not for the deposit we had to pay as well!We then got this back at the end of the holiday and got out of paying the facility fee as we complained about the rudeness of staff on arrival. There were some very lovely people on the desks at reception it was only 2 lady's that we found a problem which let the other team members down! Which was disappointed as it led to a poor start to our trip! We thought the room was clean but after looking around properly there was mess around the back of desks all on the floor, the handles of doors were wonky! A very good TV though I must say and very powerful FREE Wireless internet which was great! The side tables were very dusty also, I managed to put my elbow in all the dust when trying to turn the side lamp on! The air con/ heating was a bit confusing to use! The hotel it self was way to hot! and the elevators (lifts) are ridiculously slow considering how big the hotel is they only have 2 very small lifts!! they should install more! On the last day me and my partner were having a lay-in as we had a very long day ahead of us flying back to UK as a night flight then driving 3 hours home then going to work the following day! We basically needed sleep. We were disturbed up 4 maybe 5 times by the house keeping staff wanting to clean our room even though we had a do not disturb sign on our door and check out wasn't till 12 we were a bit upset when we got woken up at 8am and again at 8:30 and again at 9! After that we just didn't bother going back to sleep!The location of the hotel was very good and in walking distance to central park and times square also walking distance to Rockefeller Centre where my boyfriend proposed to me! Which was a lovely most exciting part of the trip!! There are metro subways all over! and two within a 30 second walk from the hotel! Yellow line pretty much takes you everywhere! I would advice to get a 7 day pass if you are going for around that many days and your thinking of using it as its cheaper than paying $3 a time! For food I would recommend Black Tap which is just across the road and do amazing burgers and milkshakes, Rays Pizza which was amazing pizza I would recommend going there! For drink and snacks around times square they are very expensive I would recommend going to a corner shop near Macys Shopping Centre as there is a cheap one around that area! Just also want to add there was another couple we spoke to who have the same room type but there family came with them for 4 days and they stayed for 7! They had 3 different rooms in total and the lady had to pay a fee of $2500 at the beginning of her holiday! She was in her 20`s too! Which was awful! Lucky she had all the money on her Credit/Debit card!When visiting New York again I wouldn't stay at this hotel due to some staff members! Also the cleanliness of the hotel wasn't great! I do wish to say Thank You to the Helpful staff though! :)",,7,3.0

Would highly recommend this.Try the subway to get around much easier than you think and very safe. Central,park has various singers under the archway bridge that changed daily, worth a look as they are all very good. Would recommend the shuttle bus back to the airport.

The bathroom and fixtures were new and nice with a rain shower faucet. The cleaning staff couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. Great service that way.

So bad in fact that the lady in charge took our room numbers the Thursday night as she walked us to the service elevators. I realize these things can happen but then open up.the other elevators for us to use. They would not even credit us the facility fee stating that they resolved the problem and it was also for the fitness area. It was really very inconvenient and I can assure you that over the 3 nights I spent there I wasted more than $30 of my (our) valuable time waiting for your elevators based on hourly wages. The room was as expected, 2 queen beds which were comfortable. The dust clumps between the wall and carpet beside the desk were honestly gross. Running a vacuum and pushing the dirt up against the wall is not cleaning it. Bathroom had blow dryer, shampoo, conditioner & body wash both of which were empty and never filled or replaced during our stay. We paid top.dollar for a holiday weekend and expected top dollar service that did not happen. The area was great, subway stop right there, walking distance to major attractions and queen beds which is rare in NYC but the rude check in, elevators not working and lack of empathy of any sort towards this fact by the person in charge on Sunday, I would not stay here again.

Two adults and one toddler. Room 511.Arrival and check-in was no problem. The hotel's layout means that certain rooms are very far from the elevator. It can be somewhat maze-like.The room was tastefully designed to match the rest of the hotel's decor theme. Aside from that it was underwhelming and smallish. We had three large suitcases, one needed to be open for access to clothing. We had to walk over/around it on the floor constantly.Most noticeable is that there is NO IN-ROOM REFRIGERATOR or bottled water provided. Also no microwave anywhere in the hotel (we even asked the front desk). So you are pretty much forced to eat out, or eat from the hotel food market.About the food market - if you reserve directly with the hotel they give you an optional $1 voucher that can be traded for limited breakfast offerings from the market. Indirect bookings do not get this voucher offer, and full price at the market is VERY expensive. 1 banana, 1 blueberry muffin, 1 plain croissant, 1 CLIFF meal bar, 2 plain coffees, 1 small orange juice, 2 boiled eggs - $47!!!!!! These are baseball stadium prices. Avoid if possible.The beds were very soft; perhaps too much so - unless you were sleeping in the dead center of the mattress is felt as if you were about to be rolled off the side.Pillows were plentiful soft too.The window curtain was a simple roll screen that did not block all light. Windows blocked most road noise, but not all.The in-room safe is standard fare and worked fine. Most problematic was the air-conditioning. It was noisy and ran the fan constantly despite us setting it on ""low speed"". It overheated and then overcooled the room in 30-minute cycles. We had just come from a 2.5-star hotel in rural Missouri, which had the exact same thermostat/control panel. Disappointing to see a 4-star Manhattan property using such a system.Bathroom was typical, clean, but nothing special aside from the surround-lighting on the mirror, and separately provided zoom-mirror.

BUT!The hotel will not be happy with my giving out a secret to help ""cure"" the one issue the hotel has: elevators are horrendous. If you do not use these secrets, wait times for one could be 5-10 minutes! UGH. So here are the secrets for defeating the elevator gremlins and get up or down as you need to do. First, there are two banks of elevators, North andSouth, both have 2 elevators... North are ostensibly floors 3-9 and South for 10 and above... Almost always a wait at North bank sop here is first secret: if you are on floor 8 (I proved) and probably 9, take the South elevators and hit the 8th or 9th floor - even though the South bank is ostensibly for 10+ ... If the South only first stops at 10, it is still far quicker to go to ten and walk down 1 or two flights. Now the reverse I have not found to be true... going to South Bank on 8th and hitting button for down has never resulted in an elevator opening on 8 ... I did not try this next secret though, so perhaps someone wishes to further experiment. Now, on to the North bank of elevators. If like we, e.g. you are on 8th floor hit BOTH up and down button, and regardless of the elevator showing up or down GET ON - do not ever pass a chance to get on the elevator. If someone is still going up to 9th that will still be far better and quicker for your ""detour"" ... we have had the same elevator go up and never open for us on its way down several times therefore ALWAYS get on any elevator that opens for you... then hit lobby and you will be on your way. Long I know, but you needed all the arrows in the quiver we had to discover to defeat the PC elevator gremlins. Would we stay here again if this was convenient for our needs? HECK YES... the elevator issue was the only drawback to an excellent hotel (well, except for a loose cable connection to back of TV which stymied my wife in discerning the problem but I cured.)

I had a bad feeling upon arrival as I stood in the check in line with no one at the front desk attending to guests. When I did get up to the desk there was no welcome, no smile, or greeting whatsoever. We arrived a bit prior to 2:00 pm and were told that no rooms were available and that we'd have to wait for a phone call at 4:00 pm. This did not matter since we were hungry and needed to get food. I confirmed that it was going to be a call and not a text and she said it would be a call ( ended up being a text). The pictures of the room showed much better online than reality. We received a room with two DOUBLE beds and not queens. The reason I emphasize is that the room description speaks to accommodating more than 2. - we have 3 and sleeping has been less than ideal. I spoke to guest services the first night and the woman told me that these were queen size and I firmly said No they were not. Then she said well they are New York queen size ?!? The elevator rarely stops on our floor which is the 5th so we have been climbing the stairwell each time we return from the city. Going down obviously is not as grueling. First night we requested some extra bath towels that were never delivered and last night ( night 2) we received an aggressive knock from housekeeping that woke us up a few minutes ahead of 1:00 am that were supposed to be for the neighbor across the hall I'm spending $1,000 or slightly more for these three nights and the service here is horrible. There is one doorman and he's in the lobby more than he is outside and no one representing this hotel is the least bit friendly. It's been three years since I've been in NYC but given this experience it seems like since they have an influx of tourists they don't care about creating a positive impression. I like the location but this hotel is not one I'm coming back to. Very thin walls as others have noted. You can definitely hear your neighbors in the rooms if they are loud as well As in the halls. There's also no room in the bathroom to put much other than a tooth brush and toothpaste. The only rack for towels is under the sink. No amenities in the room - no coffee maker or frig.

I don't if this kid had a bad night but essentially I was told that he needed nothing from me, my key was fine (guess what at 10:30 I had to go downstairs again and get new keys)! I asked if there was a reason for his tone!? And he is now arguing with me, as is his female co-worker! I say, ""at this point, I think I'd rather just check out!! Because you don't seem to need my money! He says, ""if that's what you want to do, we can do that for you!""

This landed us at Park Central Hotel and overall we were very pleased with our stay. Our flight arrived a few hours before check-in, yet we were greeted warmly by staff and were admitted early to a room that was very nice -- two double beds, large tv, nice overlook to the main street of 7th Ave. and a spacious bathroom and storage closet. The room was kept very clean by hotel staff during our stay. The hotel itself looked very nice and always smelled very refreshing :) There is a classy looking bar and lounge in the lobby, although we never used it, it looked very pleasant. There is a small market place in the lobby as well that serves beverages, baked goods, etc. that was convenient. However, there is no restaurant within the hotel, which we did not realize until we attempted to order room service. Wasn't a big deal as there are many great food places within walking distance -- recommend Ray's Pizza! The only mishap we had with this hotel was with the concierge. We asked them what was the quickest way to get to the Statue of Liberty Cruises by subway. Their directions were to take the R train which was located right outside the hotel and to get off at White Hall Street. This is exactly what we did, yet we soon realized while on the train that there was not going to be a stop at White Hall. We got off and soon realized we were in Jackson Heights, which is in New Jersey! We eventually found our way back and noted it to the concierge what had happened. Their remark was that we needed to take the R train to Downtown instead of Uptown and they assumed we knew that. With hotel guests 90% of the time being from out of town and not knowing the area, it was probably not wise for them to assume we knew that. Other than that, I would highly recommend staying at Park Central Hotel and I would definitely stay here again :)",,0,4.0

Subway stops are close by on the corners enabling guests to head in any direction. Carnegie Hall is across the street and the popular Carnegie Deli is two doors down. We were told that the hotel went through extensive remodeling a couple of years ago. This is reflected in up-to-date decor and a pleasing aesthetic. The hotel is well kept and clean except along baseboards in halls and rooms. That can be off putting upon arrival. The valance in our room was broken and hanging down one side making the first impression rather questionable. The staff at PC is very good. Everyone was helpful. We especially liked the housekeeper for our room, Marissa. She was friendly, helpful and did a great job. Security was efficient in opening our room safe when it malfunctioned and the front desk staff was always pleasant even though they never seemed to have down time. Suggestions for improvement would be to install some hooks or towel bars in the bath in reach of the shower but not in it, longer shower curtains so water does not splash out of the shower, refrigerators available for other than medical reasons, and more seating in the lobby.

However the only plus was the room was to a high standard; the hotel fell short in every other aspect. For example there are no water machines on the floors (ice yes, water no) and asking for water at the bar - we were told to buy some. This was only bettered by my partner being locked out of the room and asking the maid to let her in, to be screamed at to go to downstairs (down the hallway witnessed by other people). Although I could understand this, reception would not give her a key as she had no ID to the room despite saying the room number, our name and our stay length. You just got the impression that they did not care about you or your stay. This was not the attitude of security (who kindly helped me to my room once I had collapsed from the run) or the porter who was frozen but smiled all day to get taxis for you. These two were out shone by the rudeness of their colleagues. In addition the ""breakfast market"" had expensive coffee and no real options for breakfast bar dry muffins. Great location and rooms, just be expected to pay for everything and don't expect to be treated well. Whereas two blocks down you could have free water, free coffee and staff that actually want to help you and be polite.

We selected this hotel because of its overall location to most popular New York City attractions and because we were looking for a larger room to accommodate 3 adults. We had a double room with 2 queen beds. The room was large compared to big city hotel rooms. This hotel fit our criteria well. We loved the location and walked to most things we wanted to see. It's location on 7th Avenue was great and offered a variety of restaurants with a variety of price points. We selected the ""cheap seats"" as we called it and ended up on the 3rd floor of the hotel, no view of the city, but that was okay for us. The room was quiet and we didn't hear street noise. The hotel offered options to spend more per night to have a city view room. The staff was courteous, and the room clean and orderly. The bathroom was spacious, but we wished there was more counter space to set our toiletries. The shower was modern and comfortable. The hotel sent text messages checking on how the stay was going. There was only one small annoyance, we didn't have wash cloths for the first two days of our stay and needed to request them. The staff responded positively and promptly. On the third day, I left a note on the sink and that resolved the problem for the remainder of the stay. What would have made this stay better? We decided it would have been a complimentary cup of coffee. We get it; it's New York and everything has a cost. Coffee in the hotel cafe was nearly $4.00 a cup. C'est la vie!

Our room was clean, but it did not have a coffee maker, mini-refrig, or seating (which I would expect for the price). The hotel does not have a restaurant or room service. It didn't matter to us because there are plenty of wonderful dining options within a block of the hotel. Although there were only two elevators to our floor, we did not find it to be a problem. The best feature of the hotel is the location. It is close to the park, Carnegie Hall, Times Square, theaters, and the subway.

The room was fine, but I felt as though the layout could have been better. There is a long, slim desk, but this is taken up with a very large TV and several drawers, which is great but leaves little useful desk space. There are no tea/coffee-making facilities in the room (though they did kindly provide a kettle on request) and no fridge, which is a nuisance when you could otherwise store some supplies for breakfast in this very expensive city. The beds are very comfortable but my partner and I swapped rooms twice before we found one quiet enough to sleep. The windows of the hotel seem rather old and, though they are double-glazed, you can easily hear the street outside or the AC fans in the courtyard. I noticed every day that there were not enough staff on the desk at check-in and people in line were looking quite frustrated. Otherwise, staff were very quick and helpful to provide extra clothes hangers etc. So I have mixed feelings about this place. Perhaps it is particularly good value? I hope so, but I'm afraid I can't comment on that because I was in NY on business and the room was provided for me.","Banbury, United Kingdom",9,4.0

There is a greta little bakery right outside the front door, and a Starbucks next door to that! Convenience? Yes! The rooms are larger than standard for Manhattan, and the beds were confortable.Downside: Housekeeping was terrible. They missed our room completely the first day (and we NEVER had the do not disturb sign up) and when they did come for the remainder of the week, they did only the basics: made the bed, replaced the towels. We never got fresh glasses or even replacement liners for the ice bucket. The elevators are terrible, (slow, despite there being 4 of them) and there was ALWAYS a line to go up or DOWN! Staff didn't seem to particularly care much when these things were pointed out to them.Finally, a ""facilities"" charge of $60 x2 (for a 6-night stay) essentially meant I paid $20/night for internet.

The hotel staff we encountered were very friendly and efficient. We arrived early and were unable to check-in early (the hotel was hopping!), but we did check our bags and get out to experience NYC. When we returned later in the day check in was easy and quick.

Safe in the room. Lots of plug points. Nice decor. Ice machine in the corridor.

We did peep into a bedroom on the opposite side of the corridor to ours and it was much larger, with a seating area and much more room around the bed, but the one we saw did not have a city view. I would recommend a city view for the all round experience.The reason for only giving the hotel 4 out of 5 is that although the bedroom was clean, it was not 100%, ie. shower gel mark on the tiles, a few hairs on the bathroom floor, shampoo/conditioner/body wash holder was broken, shower tap came off in husbands hand, but worst of all, we found something very 'unsavoury' behind the bed when we moved it to look for my phone case!!! We informed reception and the 'matter' was dealt with immediately.Am sure this was a one-off oversight by housekeeping and if it wasn't for that, I would have no hesitation in giving the hotel 5 out of 5 and despite this incident, I would definitely recommend the hotel to anybody travelling to NYC.The Hotel will store your bags on departure for free if your flight is late in the day.

The location is fantastic. Easy access to most major subway lines. I never had to take a taxi during my time in the city and the concierge helped to arrange a very reasonable shuttle to Newark Airport. It is close to everything and in a very safe neighborhood. I never felt uncomfortable or nervous about returning home late or walking around the neighborhood at all hours. The room was very large for a New York City hotel, and it was always kept spotlessly clean. The beds were very comfortable, which is important to me as I was staying for five nights. The staff was always friendly and helpful. Everyone greeted me and asked if they could help in any way. My only complaint (and it is minor) is that there were only two small elevators to reach my room on the 8th floor, and sometimes we had to wait as they were full with people and luggage. Also, my room did not have a fridge, which would have been nice. However, when I commented about this on an after-stay survey, I got a prompt reply from Quimby Hightower, assuring me that I would be provided with a fridge if I requested it during a future stay. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends staying in NYC, and I would be happy to return and stay there again. Because the rooms are big, it is an ideal hotel for larger families.

The front desk staff person was particularly rude and unhelpful. Our room was right next to the elevator and since the walls are thin, we could hear the beeping and other guests waiting for it quite clearly. When I requested a change, the woman at the desk first lied about it being the only one left in the entire hotel (despite the fact that I'd just gotten an email suggesting I upgrade). Instead of taking care of a repeat customer, she said there wasn't anything else available. When I asked the customer service staff, they were able to move me to another room (lesser quality and interior facing over the HVAC units or some ugly bunch of equipment, but not near the elevator). The next day, they offered to waive the facility fee ($30 for internet access and bag check - something that just comes with most other hotels, especially when the room was over $400/night). While I appreciated the gesture, it didn't erase how disinterested they initially were in making sure a repeat guest had a decent experience.

The location is superb, touching distance from Central Park, and total escape of the busyness of New York. Within 15 mins walking or so from the madness of Times Square. This review is based on a couple from England U.K, who have previous travel experience to NY and the reason I explain is the potential differing levels of expectancy based on previous reviews read. The hotel has tasteful decor. The room (7th floor) was sizeable and of great standard. Large flat screen TV, tidy spotless bathroom, and a humongous size bed. It was a fantastic haven to relax after 12 hours a day exploring the city. Some rooms are stop overs, this room welcomed you back to refresh and recharge. If your heading off early, the complimentary Coffee, Pastry, and Fruit, grabbed from the Market Place is sufficient to kick start the day. Either catch up on the news in your room or enjoy it al fresco in Central Park either or, you decide. We had a slipshod pick up from JFK to NYC using what we thought was a reputable shuttle service (which was two buses in the end and the first drop off in the wrong location). The point is when this was explained to the concierge it was no problem. They sorted our return which in the end was door to door service, with a smile and 'it's no problem' and all for 46 dollars.This is the best option, taxis are 60 to 80 dollars, we used Go Air and didn't have to do a thing.We had good speedy wi fi, no hidden bills or things charged to the room. No real wait for the lift, we did however go out early doors, and return in the main mid evening. We did call back one afternoon early and again the rooms are such that you can just relax. There are no complimentary beverages, and limited toiletries, other than shampoo, conditioner, body wash and clean towels so I don't know what more you need. There is no restriction on taking drinks or food back to you room, but we left it as we found it......with little evidence of the late snack pizza.So depending on what you expect as a couple we needed a safe haven to recharge, with a high level of comfort, central to the main areas, but with that chill factor to relax. Helpful staff, and room cleanliness. This scored in all levels. Great place, make sure you look it up.I would recommend you make this hotel central to your visit to the big apple, a great cornerstone to your stay.","Manchester, United Kingdom",151,5.0

The location, room, and amenities are hard to beat. I wanted to give it a 4 instead of a 3 but just could not. That said, there is definitely room for improvement. The toilet seat in my room was crooked(imagine that). The dispensers for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash was loose and difficult to use and was falling apart. While taking a shower one morning, the overflow cover in the tub just fell off. The desk light did not function and there was no evidence that anyone cared. But there was evidence that someone must have known. I had to wait 5 minutes or more for an elevator, more than a couple of times and consequently there were often too many people waiting to fit on the elevator once it did come. The baggage check was quite handy (and appreciated), but I had to wait over 15 minutes once just to leave my bag. This actually made me late for one of my appointments. Only 2 elevators going to each floor even though there are 4 on your floor. In addition the elevator indicators on my floor did not light, waiting long periods made you wonder if the elevator was even going to come. I am sure I would have taken the stairs had I not been on the 14th floor. Otherwise, the room and especially the beds are very comfortable, clean and inviting at the end of a long day.","Portland, Maine",3,3.0

Great to have the Central Cafe in the lobby to grab a very inexpensive breakfast so we could start our day's plans without delay. Room was acceptably quiet. One issue was the cost of the valet service to park our car. $70/night plus city & state taxes seemed rather expensive, but I don't know how it compares to other hotel's parking services, so I'm not sure if it would be considered excessive.

When we returned at 5:00pm our room had not been cleaned and there were no towels. We wanted to take showers before the opera, but the hotel was unable to give us that service.I called Guest Services, who could not comprehend the problem and were of no help. So I called the hotel General Manager and was told that the GM’s office would take care of the problem, and going forward the GM would personally supervise services to my room. When I asked to speak with Don Fraser, the GM I was told that was not possible.The next day we arrived back in the room after being out all day and once again, the room was not fully made up and there were no pillowcases. So the GM was apparently unable once again, to find a way to supervise his own staff! I talked with GM’s office and was told that he was happy I provided feedback regarding his lack of management after my call the day before. But he clearly could not offer basic room services.Management had absolutely no idea of what they were doing, and could not figure out how to clean our room unless I called the GM’s office each day! So much for having the GM promise to supervise the housekeeping in my room. It became my job. So much for service…shameful!There was no coffee maker in the room. There was no water in the room. Not only was service terrible but there was obviously a lack of procedures to remedy guest concerns. So when Guest Services fails at the Park Central Hotel, the hotel management seems to have no procedure for quality assurance or guest escalation!There are eight elevators in the hotel. As other guest reviews have also commented, only two were apparently available during my stay. And both were periodically unavailable due to the inability of the security system to read guest room keys. Throughout my stay full elevators had to be continually evacuated because of the failures of the security technology. So there were very long waits for the one operational elevator for all 935 rooms. Many people were complaining, but the problem persisted for three days. Totally unacceptable!When we could not get the elevator to work we had to go to the bar area to wait. When we went to the bar bathroom, the doors did not open, the toilets did not flush and there was no soap. Disgusting!Clearly the Park Central Hotel has service considerably below the level of a $30 country motel in every way possible. Most disturbing was the refusal of the General Manager to even constructively talk with me about these problems and discuss why he was not able to manage the property to provide even basic levels of service to his guests, such as flushing toilets, bathroom soap, pillow cases, towels, coffee makers, water, and working elevators.There are many fine choices for hotels in New York City. In spite of the patronizing comments being made by the General Manager of the Park Central, the service problems that have been going on for years at the hotel continue to be of major consequence and continue to not be remedied by the General Manager. The time for a change of hotel management is very long overdue. Until then, I can see no reason to ever consider staying at the Park Central Hotel.","Mexico City, Mexico",28,1.0

It didn't start well due to what I have been told was my mistake of booking a room for three and stupidly I expected beds for three people but apparently not you had to order them at extra cost so another £237 added to the bill but that is not a gripe with hotel but booking company. If I put a request for a quote for 3 people I expect a price for 3 but no added was an extra bed and resort tax and yes it was all in the small print so I took the hit but it sourced the experience. The room was okay the lifts a disgrace breaking down taking ages to come and I even walked the 13 floors up once as I got fed up waiting and did not trust them. Refrigerator on request - never arrived despite asking twice. Some eateries nearby were expensive but others really good so be careful.

The lobby was large and elegant. The front desk staff were friendly enough, and when I arrived out front, I was greeted curbside by a doorman holding an umbrella who escorted me with my luggage to check-in. I found the overall check-in experience very warm and welcoming. They offer a luggage check if you arrive before your room is ready and you want to leave and come back.My room was nicely appointed with a modern look. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom featured a nice rain-style shower head in the tub. The main room had a large flat-screen TV, ice bucket with glasses, and a desk area and chair with convenient outlets for things that need to be recharged. The desk lamp, I discovered, had a USB jack on it. I plugged my phone into it each night. Basically, the room had everything I needed without stuff like a minibar or refrigerator or coffeemaker that I typically don’t need, or want to pay extra for. My room was on a lower floor, and there was maybe one night that I noticed a little bit of street noise, but generally it was quiet. Air conditioner worked fine and was not too noisy.The elevators are small and can feel a little cramped when there are several guests on it with luggage, but I think that’s understandable in a building dating back to the mid-1920s. There is a mandatory per-night facilities fee (~$30+tax) that covers some amenities that I would have expected to just be part of the room rate. There may be laws in NYC governing what services hotels can and cannot include in their room rates, hence the extra fee. You can find more on this on their website in the FAQ. Overall, I found very little to complain about during my stay.Behind the front desk is a lounge area with sofas, tables, and workspace to plug in a laptop and check your email. There is no restaurant but there is room service, and the hotel has partnered with nearby Redeye Grille. The bar opens evenings 5pm to Midnight. I found the drink prices a little steep but I suppose that’s just NYC. The Central Market cafe in the lobby is convenient for grabbing something quick on your way out, but I found if you just go out the front door and down to Tisserie in the same building, you'll find better coffee, cappuccino and food selections. Starbucks is also located in the building on the corner at W 55th St. Plenty of food options can be had within a block or two of the hotel.Overall I was very satisfied with my stay at Park Central. I prefer the quiet elegance of hotels in Midtown over other parts of the city. I would consider a stay here again upon my return to New York.","Atlanta, Georgia",2,4.0

The amenities were for ""the fitness center, the room telephone"" and other B.S. like that which you are usually NEVER charged for in other hotels, or you are charged for in advance through transparent business practices.2. The room was subpar for the price. The AC is super noisy, the carpet was dirty, particularly around the corner areas of the room, I found a roach on my duvet one evening (stayed 3 nights), the room has no coffee maker or fridge, there is only one garbage bin (in the bathroom), so you have to throw all your disposables there. Basically, it includes NONE of the amenities of regular hotels, let alone a 4 star hotel as this claims to be. Plus, the room I got was all interior, overlooking a patio. I had to check my phone to find out what kind of day it was as the natural light was so poor.3. The common areas in the lobby (dining room, for example) were chaotic. Some remained closed for ""private events"", and the line at the baggage check was super long first thing in the morning.Will never book this hotel again.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",7,2.0

The reality flies at odds with the skill of the official marketing photographer. First tip: Never get a classic room unless you are a troglodyte. I ended up with a room on the 5th floor facing the inner well of the building so the net effect is that the room is in a permanent state of semi darkness even on the brightest summer day. The room's lighting does nothing to ameliorate this either as there are only three woefully dim table/wall lamps. Don't expect to get much work done. The room is small, and the grey decor works synergistically with the overall gloom to hide a multitude of dirt and stains. There's no tea or coffee maker or fridge/minibar. There isn't even free water. Appalling for a hotel of this star rating. The 2 lifts are small and painfully slow and the corridors look a lot more tired than their 3 year age would suggest, In fact, the overall hotel just seems tired, gloomy, badly and inadequately lit. The bar and lounge are spectacular but bizarrely, does not serve drinks until 5pm so if you want a mid afternoon cocktail, you're out of luck. I have stayed in much better in the USA for a lot less. I felt I had been had especially when I was slapped with a 'facilities charge' of about $40 per night on top of what I had already paid for facilities I did not use.

I would have preferred a room with more of a view (we were in an interior room that looked out on three brick walls). The location was convenient to everything we wanted to do in NYC - Park, Subway, Museums. The room was ample sized for two adults and two teenagers - and really, you are only there to sleep. There was ample storage for all four of us to unpack a few days worth of clothing.There are so many delis/bistros/restaurants within a two-block radius no one will go hungry. We discovered the corner store 2 blocks up that sold all kinds of fresh and prepared food where it seems the locals pick up breakfast on the way to work and where the prices are much more reasonable. The only downside to the room was the tight shower stall, the hook on the back of the bathroom door was broken off so nowhere to hang towels.

First, I admit I got a good rate on line and was informed my credit card was charged for 3/4 the cost. Upon arrival I was charged 100% PLUS an extra $200. All this was ""place holder"" charges which I had to challenge to find out why I was being double billed. This hotel charges a $30 ""amenities"" fee (PLUS ADDS TAX TO THIS AMOUNT). The amenities include luggage storage before check-in and after check-out, use of one of the 4 computers (that service a 28 floor hotel with thousands of guests), an exercise room that I have no need for and room wifi which I did use. This was the most expensive wifi I have ever used; and I did not actually need it since I have data on my smart phone service. NOT EVEN A FREE CUP OF COFFEE in the lobby. No breakfast facilities or cafe except for a robber-baron Central Market in the lobby. I paid more for a diet coke and a small bag of granola snacks than I had earlier that first evening for a souvlaki dinner at the nearby Greek restaurant. Then the room. The last guest's trash on the floor. Hair in the sink. A maid who would not acknowledge my greeting in the hallway on the first day, but on the last when she wanted to clean my room for the next guest stammered on about which was my room and when was I leaving, ""Mama""; this is polite in Francophone Africa, but we are in NYC. In the middle of the night a loud alarm went off with no warning, no explanation, no instructions. I tried to call Guest Relations, but as below all I got was the general hotel phone number with options. In fact ...No guest book in the room identifying the functioning of the TV or the telephone or where to find the ice machine. Call ""0"" to find out how to find the ice machine and was directed to the hotel main number automated hell. Went out to wander and bumped into other guests who found it only because they had to pass it to get to their room. No signs in the hall way identifying directions to the machine. Filled up the plastic bag provided with the ice bucket and went back to my room. The piece de resistance: In the morning the ice had melted, the bag had leaked, the ice bucket was not sealed or water proof and the tray it sits on had a lip on three sides only. Water had dripped out of the bucket, into the tray and out the back onto the floor very close to the electric plugs AND into the drawer where I had put my clothes.

I was unaware of this so on top of the hotel charge I was hit with a $160.00 bill at checkout. I think this is unacceptable and I won't be using this hotel again. Also first 2 days the one elevator was broken so there was so much traffic waiting for the other elevator. Stairs yes but with my disability this was hard. The fridge in my room that was for my medication was not working so we requested a new one, come to find out I figured out it was the plug that was not working so I had to move the fridge myself. My medication was without fridge for 1 day until I figured this out.

Ask to see the room before checking in. Traveling with 3 friends we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights with a special History Hunters package. First the good points: the beds were comfortable and the location excellent for anything mid town or uptown.Now the rest:1. The rooms looked nothing like what was posted on their website. We must have been in an area not yet renovated. The room was dark, floors filthy.2. The bathroom smelled sour as there was not proper ventilation. There appeared to be some sort of vent over the shower, but we never heard a fan. I tracked the smell to the shower curtain liner - never could dry properly without ventilation. Bathroom was clean.3. There was no mini refrigerator in the room and no way to heat water for coffee or tea let alone a coffee pot.4. When my roommate called the desk around 10 or 11 p.m. to request a bottle of water she was told she'd have to go ""across the street"" - leave the hotel to get water for over night.5. On registering we inquired about a restaurant and were told they had none, but if we identified ourselves as staying at the hotel at the Red Eye Grill across the street we would get a 10% reduction on our bill. We were horribly embarrassed when we went to pay at the restaurant to find out that was not true. The maitre'd had never heard of such a discount.6. Part of our package was to include free admission to the New York Historical Society Museum. We were given vouchers for entrance there. The ticket sellers were baffled by the vouchers as they had never seen such before and knew nothing about them. They were most kind and accepted the vouchers anyway. Oh, and the 4th floor and half of the 3rd were closed for renovations so we saw very little - the film was good.","Myerstown, Pennsylvania",6,2.0

A supervisor eventually arrived to help.Room ""ok"" though no light by the desk making it difficult to use the desk where reading was required.My perception is that this was one hotel now split into 3 and this was problematic. Most obviously the building has 8 elevators at least 4 of which are ""walled off"" from the Park central.

We were there 4 nights and the price was different every night. Same room - go figure.

The bed was a dream-inducer. The room and the bathroom were both large enough and clean. It was a long, winding walk from the elevators (only 2 for 30 floors). The elevators are small and slow, so we were caught several times having to spend a lot of time waiting for one we could get on to go up or down. The hotel doesn't offer breakfast, but it is next door to a coffee shop/bakery and across the street from a nice breakfast/lunch cafe and from a quick-order cafe (Premier Cafe) that has very good breakfasts made to order. Starbucks is also 2 doors down. One of the concierge ladies was rude and very disinterested in helping us. She was impatient with our inexperience with subways and she really needs to look for a job where she is not interacting with tourists. The other concierge (Angela, I think) was so cheerful and helpful. She really went above and beyond in assisting us to get around and to do the things we wanted to do without wasting time. Angela deserves a raise or promotion! (Especially if she has to spend time with the grouchy concierge every day.)

The best feature was the exceptionally comfortable beds (we had two rooms with two double beds each); we rested very well. The rooms we had were a little tight, but we weren't spending much time in them, so that was not an issue. The rooms and bathrooms - toiletries courtesy of C. O. Bigelow - were clean, and while there was noise in the hallway and outside (it's NYC and one would expect a certain level of city noise), we slept well. Other than that, the rooms were bare bones without mini fridges and coffee makers, nor were there vending machines in the halls (at least on our floor). Staff courtesy was a mixed bag. The bell men were terrific - helpful and on the ball. The front desk staff were a little surly and not particularly oriented toward customer service. We had arrived at the hotel prior to the check-in time of 4 p.m. and requested adjoining rooms, as we were a family of six. We had asked one gentleman to add our request to the reservation, and he said he would. When we came back at 4 to check in, we were told that no such note was added to our reservation. Although we did have rooms next to each other, we would've appreciated a less dismissive attitude from the second front desk staffer. We were told that we could 'try again tomorrow', but to move rooms during a two-night stay is more trouble than it's worth. All in all, we would be willing to stay at Park Central again.

There are no slippers, bathrobe and proper breakfast in this hotel.Unfortunately, I am really upset with this hotel.First of all, there are no slippers and a bathrobe. When we called on a reception and asked them to bring it to us they told that hotel does not provide such service.And also - don't wait much from a breakfast. I am a big fan of tasty breakfasts and I welcome a wide choice. In booking it is written that the breakfast is included, but by breakfast they mean only one drink (either coffee or orange juice, only one option), 1 croissant or muffin (but it is only possible to choose one!) and one fruit (here choice is not big: apple, banana, orange). Staff of the company and that place where ""breakfast"" is given are not really pleasant too.Besides under a door they constantly enclosed me someone's bills though I watched nothing at all and I didn't ordered any movies on the TV.And my full impression was spoiled finally when they took the sum from my deposit, for the fact that I called to international numbers from my room telephone. I argued longly and I proved that it is a mistake. And When they checked call time, at this time I was on business meeting, only this way it was succeeded to prove that I didn't do this international call from my room.

However, the expensive hotel we stayed at didn't live up to expectations. I've stayed at several hotels in the city and this is probably the worst. First off:1. The welcoming staff was brusque and not helpful. When asked: ""Is there a restaurant in the hotel?"" - the answer was a simple: ""No"". When then asked, ""is there breakfast here?"" the answer was: ""Well, I told you there wasn't a restaurant, so of course there is no breakfast."" Later we found out by ourselves that there was indeed a nook in the hotel where several breakfast items were sold. No thanks to the staff.2. The hotel appears to be understaffed. This is for example the first time we were staying in line for leaving the luggage for safekeeping at the day of departure. The guest information desk was empty half of the time.3. The internet is slow and I could only use my iphone (which is pretty good in picking up signals) on one half of the room (near the door). When I moved to the part of the room near the window the signal died. This is not the first hotel we have experienced this with, but it is the first in NYC. We told the staff about this, they said they were going to fix it, they didn't.4. There are probably subtle changes going on in hotels, it appears that the hotels are trying to decrease what they consider to be surplus service - but they don't decrease the surplus room charge, that's for sure. In all the hotel rooms I've been to there have been certain amenities, such as information about the hotel, what's going on in the city, you know, that sort of things. Nothing like that here. 5. The housekeeping people were something else. Although hotel cleanliness was OK, we tend to be hotel guests that like to sleep in, and nothing wrong with that. This is our vacation and we decide when to get up. There were constant ""housekeeping"" calls all morning in the corridor outside our door. Even though we clearly stated that we did not want to be disturbed we got a phone call twice during our stay, asking: ""Do you want housekeeping today?"". This was around noon. If we don't want to be disturbed, I think we have earned the rights to be not disturbed, right? That's why we pay those quite a few dollars to stay there.6. For a hotel of a 4 star category, it has to be said that it's quite crappy not to offer real breakfast service except or to be not related to any restaurant nearby.7. There were only two working elevators, which is too little for a hotel of this size. There appeared to be non-working elevators on the other side. This resulted in quite a bit of waiting for the elevators to arrive. Curious thing: Nobody appeared to be going above 7th floor?8. Positive points: It's clean and nice looking. The location is optimal, that's why we chose the hotel. We asked for adjoining rooms, which we got - thank you for that.However, unfortunately I cannot recommend this hotel after our stay.","Reykjavik, Iceland",1,2.0

Pros:LOCATION! We went all over the city and I'm convinced we picked the best location. It's between Times Square and Central Park - a very easy walk to both, and there are plenty of sub lines that go through that area. Plus, it's close to some great food options and Hells Kitchen. Plus we felt completely safe the entire time. Staff. The people there were great. Everyone was accommodating and friendly. Decent size. We were impressed with how much room we had (two queen beds!) for a Manhattan hotel. We had three adults and two children and we were very comfortable.We got a great deal on parking when booking on their site. Cons:Let me start by noting I'm a bit of a hotel snob. While there was a recent renovation, it's still an old hotel and when you inspect closely, you can tell. The room was a bit dirty for my liking. I think they did a cursory sweep of the room - beds, shower, sink .. the basics were covered. But the walls weren't wiped down - I'm not sure what it was (I shudder to think) but it almost looked as if someone sprayed soda on the walls - it was in the bathroom, behind the toilet paper roll (I refuse to let myself think it was anything but soda), on the bed skirt, there was something on the TV, etc. That was my biggest issue, and for the most part, only issue with the room. And if I wasn't so much of a hotel snob, I probably could have given it a 4 since there were so many other positives. One last thing - and this is no fault of the hotel, but something I should note for families - our room faced apartments across the street. Multiple times daily we could see naked people over there (changing, using the restroom, etc.) Nothing the hotel can do about it, but if you have kids with you, I'd suggest keeping the shade closed, or requesting a room that doesn't face apartments. Would I stay there again? Maybe, if the price was right. And I would recommend it. It's a decent hotel in a great location.","Valdosta, Georgia",16,3.0

Breakfast service in the hotel are ridiculously expensive. The hotel charges 30 additional usd for the gym and lugagge keeping service, using it or not. It's actually a terrible gym, Most treadmils are useless. Not even one spinning bike. Really sad to have gone though this hotel, the only person who made it bearable was James, one of the managers.

I was appalled at their imposed extra fee. I have stayed at Westhouse (which is connected) several times before, and their mandatory fee is because they offer breakfast, wine and appetizers at night, and round the clock coffee upstairs. At Park Central, however, it was called a ""facility fee"" and covered access to the gym, business center, access to local calls (apparently they think this is 1986 and hotels still charge for local calls....as outdated as cell phone minutes)...and get this: storing luggage day of arrival/departure! It is obvious they are grasping for anything they can think of to make extra money even though these are things that are included at any other hotel, and they do not legally have a right to charge for things that may or may not be used, such as the business workstations. I arrived at nearly 10pm and left in the morning - hardly a need for gym and workstations. Again, charging for day-of luggage storage is simply laughable. What is more shameful about this ""facility fee"" is the state of their facility. I walked into the room and immediately saw one of the light bulbs on the nightstand lamp was out. When I entered the restroom I was almost made sick to my stomach when I saw the dark yellow stain ring inside the toilet, and when I tried to shower the dispenser fixture was completely broken and nearly collapsed...and the soap was empty. I went to the bathroom counter to get the bar soap and the wrapping had lint hanging off. I could not wait to get out of there!How a hotel anything above a 3 star present a room in this condition to a guest....then have the nerve to charge a bogus ""facility fee"" for nothing extra on top of it, is obnoxious and shameful.

I had two problems with my stay. First, when we checked in there was a printed sign that stated a mandatory $30 was added to every stay for use of the fitness center, Apple computers with internet access, and local and long distance calls. This feels very sneaky to me. Why are these costs not added in when you book a room? I think transparency is important and every guest should understand all the fees before they confirm their room. Also, these are arbitrary fees to place on everyone. It should be applied to those customers that use those amenities. Most people have cellphones to make local and long distance calls, and use their cell for the internet.My second problem were their elevators. The elevators are very small and run slowly. Many times it would open on my floor and already be filled. Multiple times I had to wait for the second or third elevator to come by. This seems unacceptable for a hotel with 26 floors and a high volume of guests.That being said, it is centrally located in Midtown and close to Central Park (hence the name).

When we got there, the front desk lady was not very nice and had my husband and I on a completely separate floor from the kids. I told them this was not acceptable since I booked 6 months ago. about 25 min later they changed us to side by side rooms. She told me they do not have adjoining rooms at the hotel.

The kids room was empty and we had to ask for it to be refilled 2 days in a row. Also, their air conditioning did not work and it was very hot! We had to ask 2 days in a row for that to be fixed. Our room did not have towels the last full day we were there. And lastly, my daughter had bought some clothes in Times Square. The maid somehow took them!

After the first night my daughter, who slept in one bed by herself. had some bites up and down her legs. After the second night she had more. We hadn't seen any biting bugs outside and neither my son nor I had any bites. We notified management and they placed us in a different room. No new bites after that. The manager told us they would inspect the bed and let us know what they found the next day. They never did. So before I checked out I asked again. I was told that the testing service wouldn't be in until later in the week but that they would definitely call or email me as soon as they found out the results. Well, it's been about 3+ weeks since my stay and no one has contacted me. I'm pretty sure something hanging out in that bed was biting my daughter after comparing the bites she had to bed bug bites that I see online. At a minimum I would have expected management to honor their commitment to follow up with me. They failed not just once but twice to follow up. An offer to compensate us in some way would have been nice as well. A partial refund or an upgraded room. The 2nd room they put us in was OK, but the bathroom had a strong mildew smell. Needless to say my family and I will be staying someplace else the next time we're in NYC. I can maybe give a NYC hotel a pass once for a bed bug issue, but not following up with me as they promised to nor offering anything to compensate tells me they really don't care.

The gym is good and often quiet, wifi is fast (both are included in an additional obligatory $32 daily cost levied on arrival). There is no coffee making machine in the room (which one would normally expect to find in this type of hotel) however Tisserie a lovely cafe next door opens at 6am! There are only 2 elevators which can often mean it takes a while to get to where you are going! Location is the best thing about the hotel as it is right next to the subway and 2 blocks from Central Park. All in all a good stay if a little ""non-personal"" on the service front. Absolutely fine for a business trip and I plan to use the hotel again. ",UK,55,4.0

I was told that there was nobody on duty (???) but I was given an email address for ""B Joseph"". I have emailed this person twice in the past 2 months and still had no response.The only way I was able to get anyone to respond was by tweeting them, (nothing like public naming and shaming to get a reply).I was eventually emailed by ""Quimby Hightower"" who apologised and promised to investigate the issue.

The hotel looks beautiful from the outside, a fairly glamorous building with doormen waiting to welcome you, but nothing about the inside matches the inviting exterior. At least during my stay, the hotel was insanely crowded with foreign tour groups so the lobby was always packed and it was impossible to get an elevator. I ended up taking the stairs up 8 flights because I just couldn't wait any longer.There are at least a dozen people behind the concierge desk at any point, but they're always talking to one another or staring down at their computer monitor and if your time is at all valuable you'll just have to walk up and interrupt them and deal with the puckered sour look they give you because otherwise you'll stand there all day.The hotel room itself was acceptably clean and spacious (for New York) but drab and thin-walled. They also still have those connecting doors that link your room to the one next door, which I could deal with for one night but not for any longer because I could hear my neighbors pretty clearly.Even the bathroom was a bummer. I love taking a bath in a hotel but the tub wasn't comfortable (awkward angle didn't allow for any recline) and the flickering overhead light made me feel like I was in an asylum. They obviously don't go in for any pampering here, not even the basic stuff like fancy soap or a shower cap!I was happy when my stay concluded and resolved not to return there.

This year we chose NYC and decided on Park Central Hotel because it seemed like good rates for the midtown area and very convenient to a lot of the metro transportation stops throughout Manhattan. However, I regret our stay with this company.We came to NYC with one credit card and the balance was $3000 when we arrived in town for our 5 day/4 night get away. The room expense was quoted at $1200 (plus and additional $200 for incidentals). This seemed fair enough until they placed two authorizations for $1400 on our card within minutes of being in NYC. This left us with a grand total of $200 to travel, entertain, and eat in one of the most expensive cities in the nation. Needless to say, we didn't have our best vacation as a family. The Park Central Hotel staff did place a reverse on the authorization but it did not take place in enough time me for us to enjoy NYC. They did however offer us all snacks (sandwiches, chips and a drink) for one meal at their ""Central Market."" They also offered a cocktail to my wife and I. However, ruining my family's vacation and then offering me chips and dip doesn't quite make it right!! Lesson learned, bring another credit card (in case another dumb hotel makes this decision again in the future). OR, stay at the Wellington or Salisbury hotels...which are both in the same area of midtown and cost the same amount as Park Central. In fact, the Salisbury may even be a better location. DO NOT stay at the Salisbury!!! They offered us NO DISCOUNT off of this stay or any future stay...but a bag of chips was nice.",,4,1.0

The only food option is the coffee bar in the lobby and it was for morning options and beverages only.

There was black mold and in some areas there was white mold on the black mold.

We did so much walking around Manhattan and the subway locations nearby were great for getting to the Ground Zero & the Statue of Liberty. The room we had was massive by New York standards, and a lot larger than we were expecting. Our room was clean and very modern, with a huge comfortable bed and a great wifi connection. Although we could occasionally hear people in the corridor, this was not an issue for us and we also had no problems with road noise etc from outside, it was not totally silent but it never would be in central Manhattan! There were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room which was slightly inconvenient but not so much an issue as they have a a coffee shop in the lobby. I am sure if requested we could have got something in the room. There is no hotel restaurant but this was not an issue as you have so many great options on your door step.

In addition, the hotel, despite being very large, does not have restaurant, only a coffee place at the entrance, which also offered cereal bars, some fruits and a very expensive and low quality coffee. Also, once we were interrpted by the cleaning lady, that dis not ask and just came into the room when were were already in.

What I didn't get was the $30 facility fee. I get that it's to cover all ""facility"" items like the gym and luggage hold areas, but what I really could have used was a bottle of water in the room as a courtesy. Most hotels offer that but this hotel doesn't. And there are no vending machines, so if the little store in the lobby closes and you're thirsty, you're out of luck. But you better have a lot of cash for that market (a can of coke was $3 and a small bottle of water was $4). We also spent $10 on a small pack of oreos and an ice cream bar. I know the city is expensive, and I'm from the area, but this is ridiculous. Bring some bottles of water with you if you can and some snacks. And if you want a drink from the bar, it doesn't open until 5:00 even on the weekend, which was disappointing since we were looking to get a drink before heading out to an early dinner. I rated it very good because the location cannot be beat and it was very quiet for the area, check in was a breeze (even got in a little before the check in time).

On this visit to New York we chose to stay at the Park Central Hotel as we know this location and its proximity to everything we wanted to do on this visit. Due to my daughters jet lag we where regularly seen in the Central Park play areas at 7am. Lol. The hotel was very nice and the staff were more than helpful. We did have to request a fridge in the room to store milk, this request was dealt with promptly and with no time we had a fridge in our room large enough to put the cow in. The only down side to our stay was the mandatory charge for the wifi, but as we was already aware of this charge then we can't complainWe found getting around the city was far easier underground than it was above ground especially with a toddler. As we have visited New York before we had a rough idea of where we wanted to be and of the subway and metro, which were faultless.

Something's really wrong with this hotel. Maybe it is being sold or closed soon for massive renovation or perhaps it has been abandoned and is being work crewed by inconsiderate former prison wardens. I don't know where to begin so let's start in a room that was filthy with dust, previously used sheets, a bath tub with clots of hair still no the drain, a clock radio that refused to work, no literature on any amenities offered and blocked by cleaning and stocking carts the whole time of my stay and TWO vacuums parked by my room door for the four day stay.The elevator refused to work TWICE. There are banks of elevators that are closed off and the ice machine on my floor NEVER was able to dispense ice.When I complained that I couldn't control the heat or air conditioner a workman came to my room and noted that BOTH were currently turned off since the weather was mild. He suggested I open a window slightly and offered to show me how. When I went to get a cab the doorman pushed me aways saying the cab line was only for guests using the doorman. Let me say this again because it shocks me every time I say it: HE PUSHED ME. When I complained to the front desk they said they were sorry and then immediately turned away.One of the three lights in the room never worked properly. On my final day they just refolded and restocked my used towels. There were no notes in the room to give them permission to conserve and do that.

Charge a little more if you have to or charge for use of the gym/business center- don't make your guests feel like they have been taken advantage of. With that being said the hotel is very nice.

They will offer to call you when it is ready. Remember: no matter what hotel you visit, it is smart to tip the person at the reception desk (they are able to do more for your hotel experience than any other single person). There is a VERY quick, easy luggage storage room in the main lobby; the staff are very friendly. The ""Central Market"" is a fast, friendly store in the lobby of the hotel. They have a very good selection of juices, snacks (nuts, snack mixes, etc), yogurts, pastries, coffee and espresso, and some other more substantial offerings. I used this several times - all staff were friendly and helpful. It is expensive, but very convenient. Behind the registration desk is a very large lounge with easy chairs and work surfaces. It looks like it was a ballroom with a very high ceiling, now converted to a lounge during the day and a bar in the evening. There are three computers in the lobby that you may use for free for 15 minute intervals if you need to search for an activity or if you need to print boarding passes. The concierge was also very patient and helpful. The lobby is very beautiful. The rooms are nice - clean, reasonably spacious. The bed is neither too soft nor too hard (I prefer a very hard bed, but was perfectly comfortable on this one). Bed linens are very nice. They provided 4 pillows on the bed, and they varied so that you should find one that is comfortable for you (I may just have been lucky, but I like this feature in a hotel). There is no refrigerator, but there is convenient ice in the hallway. There is a safe in the closet. Bigelow shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were provided. There is a large flat screen TV. Resolution was not great. The selection of movies was great! They have movies that are still in theaters, as well as recent films. They had a ""daily special"" of 6 or 8 films that were a reduced cost ($6.99). There is a daily ""facilities fee"" that they add on to your quoted nightly rate; it includes the Wifi. Use their website to book your room. I found out about them thru Jetsetter. However, I had an unexpected trip to NYC and checked the hotel website 2 days ahead of my visit. They noted that they have a matching policy and even though their room rate that night was only $125, they noted that Priceline was offering $120 and that they would match it (Note: I have booked here a number of times over a three month period - the room rates range based upon occupancy rates from a low of $120 to a high of around $300). I was in town to take a class at Alvin Ailey - it is just an 8 minute walk. There is also a Whole Foods that is a 10 minute walk. There is a subway stop beside the hotel.

The bed was extremely comfortable, I'd go so far as to say perfect! There was excellent wifi in the rooms and well as an iron and hair dryer for use. I'm only going four stars as a few things let the place down. Firstly the water pressure in the showers. It took me ages to wash shampoo from my hair the pressure was that low. The bathroom set up was way too small. The toilet had clearly been moved as the door was hitting it so now it isn't straight in the room. You have to shimmy In up the side of the loo to close the door behind you. Considering the actual room was so big it surprises me they made the bathroom so small? Finally the lifts! We experienced some huge queues for these. On the 11th floor we one time came out of our room to join a 20man deep line. Every time the lift then did stop on our floor it was already full making us late several times for meeting family in the lobby. These queues were also present when going up, several times we returned to the hotel to be greeted by a 20man (plus luggage) line waiting to go up.

Having travelled extensively in the USA, we have come to expect a certain standard from 4* hotels that just isn't achieved at the Park Central. Whilst it's location is great, we were really shocked by how standoffish and rude the female reception desk staff were. Basic questions seemed like too big an ask for them, and it made us feel reluctant to ask for any tourist advice. Further, the lift system was utterly ridiculous. It's a massive hotel, and returning in the evenings became such a chore, as we would stand waiting for the elevator for ages due to the limited number of lifts available, and the large volume of guests. Even when we got to our floor, we had to do a full circuit of the hotel from the elevator to our room, which seems rather silly when guests generally have luggage and /or shopping bags. Our room looked pleasant enough, but on the first night smelt like wet dog due to damp laundering (I think the towels were the offending items). Whilst the room was relatively clean, the bathroom was small and never felt as clean as we would have liked. There was no mini-bar which was a bit inconvenient, and no hotel information provided. The air con was also hit and miss. The hotel bar was fairly good - the prosecco cocktail is worth a try, as is the red velvet cheesecake from the on-site bakery. The guys on the main door are lovely, and could certainly teach the receptionists a thing or two. Whilst our overall experience was okay, we certainly wouldn't choose to stay at the hotel again.",UK,25,3.0

But because of the other hotel issues my backs started to hurt therefore makingHarder to stay the whole time. It's was funny because I would have booked at the park central at first, having stayed here five years ago, but thought the excelsior looked nice, I hadn't realised that the park central had undergone changes,.So first thing Tuesday I went to the park central just to have s a look around, and my daughter liked it, so I spoke to one of the staff who s name was alvin, I explained my predicament and he called his manager. Elvirus. I then went on to book a room for one night at 180 + various taxes, whilst virgin rep where trying to relocate me, and because of my back pain I decided to bring my holiday back to Thursday , leaving earlier.So in the end me and my daughter spent three days in New York, two nights at the park central.We loved the new. Bar area they built, with nice seating and lighting.We booked in to a double twin room on the west side level 10' room 1064. The lift was running fine, two at a time, but there were four. You had to use your room key to activate the lift, for safety reasons, but after a day we had trouble with our key, it wasn't working so locked out of our room and had to track down a housekeeper for help, went to front desk and they promptly changed the key for us.Our beds were just like last time, comfortable , they didn't have duvets on the beds just sheets, but that was ok our air con. And thermostat worked much better, we could Control the heating adjustment easily, the heating didn't blow cold air random like the excelsior did. We kept the heating setting on a comfortable 22 degrees, you still hear the noise of the fan even at low fan setting, but that was ok.Last time ther was a case of bed bugs, so I was bit wary of this, but we see ok,p.I liked the colour of the room and layout. The bathroom was clean, only thing was that the toilet was quite close to the bath, and once you sat down you had to turn around to get toilet paper off the roll, as it was behind you, which wasn't easy with my backache.No fridge or tea making facilities in room either. But the big screen tele was nice,Made came every morning and made the bed etc.I paid 600 dollars for two nights, but did get. 114 dollars deposit back,.I know it's expensive 180 per day plus the extra amenities , various taxes and fees all add up. Other hotels include the various city tax in their price, but this still charges on top. We had a pleasent experience here, with all staff that we spoke too. Thank to ELvirALvin and Soku. For their help in relocating us.If we come here we will stay here again.We like visiting New York, and next time not going to mess around with hotels ,even though this is expensive, I'll stay here.Just one thing, I was told upon pre ordering a black taxi from the hotel that it would be flat charge of. 65 .dollars, for airport drop, plus tip. But when we got to the airport the driver told us it was 83 dollRs. In didn't really query it, because it took us one and half hours to get to JFK because of the traffics.And noticed that our carpet in the room near the edges of the walks was a bit dusty,","Greater London, United Kingdom",80,3.0

I know New Yorkers like to portray an attitude but in a hotel I expect a bit more than people just grunting at you as you hand over money! The other negative was we had a twin room and realised at 11pm one of the beds only had a sheet and not a duvet! When I went to reception to complain no one took control and I had to wait 30 minutes for someone to bring me a duvet (without a cover!). Because our daughter was in bed I requested it be bought to me in reception but told that couldn't be done so I had to wait in the hallway whilst they tracked down a duvet!?

Our room was at the back so no nice view but also no traffic noise. A bit of noise from the generators outside but it was easy to just tune it out.

It was a problem only one night when our neighbors were noisy late at night, otherwise it was just annoying.Overall we would stay there again, because it is a nice hotel, the staff are generally good, and the location outweighs the bad points.","Sydney, Australia",2,4.0

We have seen several upgrades and remodeling jobs through the years since and this time it seems like the best renovation was done. It is tastefully redone with a soothing palette and the different hotel spaces seem configured in a way that makes more room and sense. The room we got was nice with ample space for my family of 4. True to the pictures shown here on this site and the hotels' own website. We stayed in a deluxe two queen room. Beds were comfortable and had enough drawer space for us. The bathroom was such an upgrade for what we had experienced in the past. Housekeeping kept it very clean and towels were small but absorbent. I really loved the extra space provided with the shelf under the vanity and the curved curtain rod in the shower, which thankfully has become customary at most hotels. Wish the bathrooms were outfitted with a fan.We did have trouble with the temperature in our room though. After speaking with guest relations, who were trying to accommodate us, we learned there was nothing they could do. Albeit a brand new remodeling job, the a/c remains with the original system where only heater will work when it's cold outside and only the a/c will work when it's hot. Makes sense, except we are used to sleeping in a cold room and so could not get benefit of the a/c. Thankfully we were able to turn off the heater with the thermostat in the room because it kept kicking on. Even without the heater on, the room was incredibly warm and stuffy. We took advantage of the cold weather outside by cracking the window a little open when we were in the room, even while we slept. So we were comfortable in the end. Each night we enjoyed the bar at the hotel which is nicely hidden behind the reception desk. All the bartenders were great. We were given 2 complimentary drinks the first night for the adults, by the person who took care of us at check in /reception, she was friendly and professional. Wish I remembered her name, but she was working 3/17th when we checked in around 10pm. At the suggestion of the hotel, we also dined at the Redeye Grill, who treated us very well and everything we ordered was delicious! The restaurant is at the corner of the hotel, on 56th street.We stopped coming here a few years ago because although we were patient with the remodeling going on through the years, management didn't seem to really address certain concerns that could be helped or seem sympathetic to them. Attempts at the time were not made by different staff members to address one major problem that we had on our last visit with smoking in the room next to us. Simply we had to live with the way things were which agitated our child's asthma. It was not only us but seemed like many guests were unhappy with how different things were handled and how many of the hotel personnel seemed unhappy with their jobs and unfriendly overall. A very big difference now with all of it.So with the remodeling done, we gave it another try and hoped personnel had changed out or changed its ways. We were happy we did a second chance and look forward to our next stay.",Ft. Lauderdale,13,4.0

I made reservations at The Park Central and dinner reservations for that night. We stay in NYC often but have never stayed at The Park Central so I checked the reviews first. We went with our 2 children, 9 and 15. I usually try to find rooms that offer space, more on that later. We checked in and went to our room, 608. The room itself was filthy, pics are shown. The window covering is just a plastic shade, ours had a cut through it which was clearly not going to block out any light. The bathroom door did not fit into the door frame and wouldn't stay closed. I called the front desk and they said someone from housekeeping would come up to fix the problems. After waiting a while we called down and said someone would have to fix them while we were out. We came back 2.5 hours later to find that nothing was done. We called the front desk and told them we needed to start getting ready for dinner. An engineer came up, looked at the door first and told us that the doors ""don't lock for safety reasons."" Then he told us that it was the contractors fault for using the wrong size door and he couldn't fix it. He went to look at the shade while I called the front desk to tell them we weren't going to stay in a room without a bathroom door that closed. My husband asked him to speak to the front desk to tell them the problem and he dashed out of the room. The front desk said that they would called us back but we told them we would be in the lobby with our luggage so they could switch our room because it was now getting getting close to our dinner reservation and we still hadn't showered. The guest relations manager in the lobby said the hotel was full. I insisted they find a different hotel for us to stay in. They said since we booked with Expedia, they had no responsibility-however I paid the hotel directly, so they are responsible. I did call Expedia to complain and they offered to try to find us another room in another hotel. (While I was talking to Expedia The Park Central said the engineer would go back and fix the room. My husband went back to the room, no one ever went back, it remained empty.) While Expedia was looking for a hotel the guest relations manager told us that someone canceled their room and we could switch rooms. Because we needed to get ready right now we took the room, how could it be worse? This new room was right across from the elevator and guess what else we found out about the Park Central the windows of the hotel are not soundproof! That's right-you can every little noise outside your window all night long. Every honk, every conversation, every car backfiring-every single noise. Not to mention the elevator dinging and the conversations of the people coming in and out of the elevator all night. Our family got no sleep at all! Here are other things that stink about this hotel: the elevators: tiny and slow-you can easily wait 10 minutes for an elevator. The phone system: to reach the front desk you push zero wait through a whole message of how you have to push another number to reach the front desk. They have no doormen (the doors are automatic) or security in the lobby so people who are not guests feel free to sit in the lobby all over the couches and chairs. Their rooms could not be cheesier: the light bulb in the bathroom was buzzing and blinking with that old timey fluorescent thing. There's no robes, mini bar, fridge, curtains. It's the most very basic of basic hotel rooms, but they charge a mid range fee (plus a $30 facility fee). Here are 3 hotels that are way nicer that we have stayed at that are: roomier, nicer, cleaner, have much better teams and are in the same price range: The Benjamin (this an all suite), The Trump Soho (look for discounts, they are out there) and The Eventi.

Plus a nail, or something sharp, sticking out of the carpet at the closet door which was promptly fixed.I had to wear earplugs one night when noises of construction, or what sounded like construction, people shouting, banging, etc. could have made sleep impossible.

The manager on duty - Mr Beaubrun, made up for all the sins she had committed.He was responsive, pleasant and superbly professional and as a result of this, we pledged to return to the hotel.The room was very comfortable and the beds were a dream to sleep on.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",1,3.0

I booked it through booking.com which was a very bad move.. The payment for the room was taken out in multiple instalments on the same day which meant I got charged by my bank multiple times for a non Stirling transaction fee! When I spoke to the hotel they said it's not their fault as booking.com to get the best rates had made multiple bookings.. But I was not informed of this and when I spoke to booking.com they said it was not the case. We got here very late after a long days travelling to then be told because it was under multiple bookings, every day I would need to check out and check back in again and authorise a credit card which was absolutely ridiculous! I told them how inconvenient it is (reception gets extremely busy and often has huge queues as well) and eventually they said they'd do it all in one, however, I still had to fill out multiple forms which were exactly the same but for each check in date!! The only issue was constantly being logged off of the wifi and having to sign up again every time. The hotel room was very nice and clean, but it was impossible to get a good nights sleep, noise from both inside and outside the hotel kept me awake every night. I suppose you should expect this being so close to Times Sq, but I was woken up on numerous occasions with people outside holding down their horns in the middle of the night, or other guests deciding to have a 2am extensive chat outside my room. If I were to go to New York again I think I'd stay a bit further out, previously we stayed in TriBeCa and it was a lot more relaxed and I actually got some sleep. Plus there isn't enough lifts so every time we wanted to get up or come down (8th floor) we had to queue. ","Reading, United Kingdom",37,3.0

This past trip overall was good, but I did run into just a few little snafus. I stayed March 19-26. Booked a 2 queen bed room, through a 3rd party site well back in October. My mother and I arrived at about 5 or 6pm. And when we got to the desk the woman informed us that they ""no longer had 2 queen beds available"" Only ""king size bed"" rooms left. I was pretty mad because I specifically book two beds when I travel because I don't like to share beds with people. I have had multiple back surgeries in the past I am more comfortable sleeping alone. I just think it's stupid to force guests to share the same bed and just assume that because I am traveling with my mother we will say yes. Well No. The way I see it is: would they have forced two business professionals to share the same bed too? Doubtful.So we complained and oh magically a room was available... interesting. The front desk woman did not seem pleased. She seemed rather annoyed. I understand (having a friend that works in hospitality) that booking through a 3rd party kind of screws the hotel, but regardless it still gives you business, and it brings repeat guests back. That is why I booked again after my stay back in October. For the inconvenience they provided us with a 2 free drink card. If you're high maintenence, I wouldn't suggest staying here. I'm very low key and low maintenance but my mother isn't. Room service is only at certain hours, the elevators take forever, and the amenities are rather limited. We slept in one morning and called housekeeping when we were leaving for the day so when we got back the room would be clean but when we got back it wasn't. My mom called housekeeping and asked for extra towels and for someone to clean the room they said someone would be up to do that. We received the towels and asked if someone was going to clean the room too and the man said he thinks so. So my mom called back and housekeeping forgot that part of the conversation I guess, so then they came up. Personally I don't care if my room is cleaned every single day, one day without it isn't going to kill you, but my mom is different as I mentioned early. So she complained and we received 2 more free drink tickets. Putting those drink tickets to use in the bar and lounge area, and being a guest for a week, I had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know the bartender Jamaal. He was so kind and wonderful! He made our stay even better! They better keep him around. Overall the stay was good, not as good as my first stay at this hotel but honestly they do what they can, plus you can't beat the location and price. I am sure I will be a repeat guest again at some point, as I travel to NY every so often. ","Los Angeles, California",3,4.0

Yet, I have no choice but to share the miserable start to our seven day vacation in New York. Early check-in. Hotels cannot guarantee this and I was given the normal disclaimer after calling to request. We arrived about 10am off our red-eye flight and told the room wasn't ready. This was understandable as it wasn't even checkout. However, here is where we lose any feeling of being valued as a customer. We were instructed to come back at 1pm. Upon doing so, we were updated the rooms weren't quite ready and try again in 30 minutes. This continued for three hours while we wasted the day in the lobby. One room opened up about 4:15, while the other wouldn't be ready until 7-8pm.The uninterested desk clerk indicated multiple schools were checking in and had a contract, so we would have to wait until after. I'm pretty sure my prepaying $4000 entered us in a contract, where my room was to be ready at 4. Again, some empathy or offer to contact us instead of standing around aimlessly could have helped. So now going on 36 hours without sleep, without room, and without any apology from the staff...What to do? We try getting on the Internet to distract from the #&*@ty service. After many unsuccessful attempts, called for help - the Internet is down. Just like my expectations for this hotel. I will update this at the end of my stay in hopes that this hotel makes some effort to rectify the worst possible start to my families spring break.

So, it was marvelous to see that the Park Central is brilliantly located opposite the Carnegie Hall, five mins from Central Park and two mins from the subway. The rooms are huge, big beds and big tv, great bathroom.Where it falls down is the lack of amenities for its customer base - it has a shop to buy coffee and snacks, which shuts at 9pm, it has a bar that opens at 5. There's no food provision, and they compensate for this by allowing the guests to do anything - so a lovely bar is spoiled by guests eating take away burgers and pizzas and drinking their own drinks. Very odd indeed. The building has loads of lifts - all bar a few have been blocked off and are out of use - it can take a while to get a lift down from the 10th floor or higher (try grabbing one going up and stay in it!). Another mention to Elizabeth from customer relations who was excellent dealing with the issues another of her colleagues had caused - I guess she's used to it!All in all - if you know what you're getting and how much (including the well publicised if you bother to look facility fee) - it's a great hotel and we'd use it again....","Altrincham, United Kingdom",1,4.0

The room was not very large but then we only were there to sleep and clean up so it was fine. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was newly remodeled; very clean also. It was only a few blocks from Central Park so we walked there a few times. You MUST see Central Park when in New York. And walk down to Time Square.

They market their rooms dishonestly by using a false low price to lure customers in, and then perform a ""bait and switch"" by adding on a $30 fee per night. This is a $30 ""facilities fee"" per room night that cannot be avoided. There is no additional use of the facility beyond your room that you are paying for -- it is actually another charge for your room that is separate from city and state taxes. They do this so they can post a low but entirely unusable price on websites like this one, and then add on the rest of the room rate after you've decided to book. They post a non-comparable price to lure customers in. I'd rather make a fully-informed choice upfront and pay a higher price rather than have a bait and switch performed on me. I travel to NYC weekly for work. They got me once as a first time customer, but they will not have me as a customer again. Tripadvisor should ban and de-list hotels that do not post a comparable price on websites. If every hotel used the shady practices of this hotel, there would be no way to compare prices without reading the fine print of each hotel offer.

Was not a problem at all.There are reviews mentioning the lack of restaurant at this hotel, but given the location you only need to step outside and you have a huge choice!The only faults I can say are:1) reception staff were not rude however they provided no helpful info on the location, wifi, amenities etc upon arrival. I suppose we could have asked the concierge but would have been nice to have a little info on check in. Also on check out we had no question on whether we enjoyed our stay - just think it would have been nice.2) the housekeeping staff were very friendly, did a wonderful job cleaning the room however in the hallways they seemed to dump their bags of rubbish/ linen in the most inconvenient locations - one being right outside our room door upon arrival!

I booked my flights and hotel as a package on Expedia and got a very good deal. I contacted the hotel prior to our visit and requested a higher room at a cost of $8 dollars per night. This, I feel, is totally worth it as its a lot quieter and you get better views. I was also advised there would be a $26 facilities fee per night which covered gym use, wifi and calls. This I was not happy about. Not only did I not need or want any of the above as I had World Traveller on my phone, when we arrived it was actually $30 per night which I think is totally ludicrous. I understand that most hotels in NYC have the same fee so this isn't a direct dig at Park Central. I just don't feel it's fair to charge people for something they didn't use. We were told we couldn't check in until 4pm but arrived around 1pm to drop off bags and were able to check in straight away so that's something worth checking. The check in process was quick and easy but we did notice that earlier in the morning and later on in the evening there were very long queues and only one or two members of staff. I had read that there was only one working elevator and it was very slow. There were two and both worked fine so I'm not sure if this was fixed prior to our visit. The hotel was clean and the bed was the single most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in and I believe we stayed in the cheaper room so I'd love to have seen what the higher priced rooms were like! The rooms were attended to daily and there were always fresh towels. They supply shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. There was also an iron, ironing board and hair dryer in the room. Our room was air conditioned but the unit was noisy and didn't go any lower than 18.5 which just made the room warm and stuffy. We mainly slept with the windows open and allowed the cool air to circulate. There is a small shop where you can get coffee and breakfasts etc but we didn't use this as we wanted to explore all of the delicious options outside of the hotel. We had one drink in the bar and it was very excited expensive. A standard price for a disaronno and Coke was around $9 everywhere I went but the hotel charged $18! So we didn't drink there again. The location of the hotel was great. To the right was Times Square and to the left Central Park. It's very close to a couple of Subway stations and there's a Starbucks right next door. There are plenty of food places in the vicinity but I would advise travelling a little further out as the area is very Commerical. The best food we found was on 9th avenue which was close enough to walk to. All in all, the hotel was great and I would definitely recommend it anyone and would certainly stay there again. When we were leaving the hotel recommended we use one of their drivers as opposed to a yellow cab as they run on a meter and at rush hour could rack up quite a charge! It worked out cheaper and the driver was very friendly. ","Norwich, United Kingdom",22,4.0

The customer service, however, has not.Shortly after arrival (that’s how poor the prior notice was) I received an email stating that they could not honour my reservation due to maintenance issues with the hotel. As I had just checked in successfully at the front desk, I decided to ignore this strange email and settled into my room. Never heard anything further.However, throughout the course of the day I noticed that hotel staff in the lobby were turning away guests and not honouring reservations due to the “maintenance issue”. What a joke.I felt sorry for these people as we all know how difficult it can be to secure decent accommodation in NY, and it wouldn’t surprise me if they were given the same length of prior notice that I received (i.e. none).In respect of the room, I have some positive comments. The room was small (typical for Manhattan) but comfortable and modern. I had a decent night’s sleep in the bed (mattress soft to medium) and the towels and linens were of high quality.The negatives were as follows:• SO MUCH NOISE. The walls must be paper thin. I am not a light sleeper by any means but I found it incredibly difficult to get decent rest in this hotel between the doors slamming and audible plumbing, and the housekeeping talking right outside my door every morning.• The joke of a breakfast that you can opt to pay for. It’s literally just a muffin and a juice. I threw mine in the bin and went to the deli next door.• Poor customer service. I must have seen about 4 or 5 conversations between management and distressed travelers, and all they could say is “there is nothing we can do, we sent you an email yesterday”. Not good enough.Location is good and the deli a few doors down is superb. I’ve also read management’s comments to some of these reviews and they sound childish. Won’t stay here again out of principal and would rather pay the extra $$ to stay at the Marriott Marquis or equivalent.Park Central, take note – if your aim is to ensure that no one returns to your hotel, you’re doing well.

If you do business with these folks, what you need to be prepared for is the Moving Shell Game. On each page the price of the room changes, the format of the price changes and at NO TIME WAS I PROVIDED THE ACTUAL PRICE I WAS TO BE CHARGED. Yesterday I went through Booking.com to reserve a room at Park Central Hotel. The website advertised the Lowest Price Guaranteed "" at $115. When I put in my date request, the price total for three nights was $540 in large bold letters and that is the price on my receipt in large bold letters. When I check my credit card this morning the total charged is $728.14. For the advertised room of $115.00 plus not included: 14.75 % tax, US$ 3.50 City tax per night, US$ 32.66 service charge per person per night. So now the price is $242.71 per night for the advertised ""Lowest Price Guaranteed"" $115 room. When I called Bookings.com customer service the agent saw no problem with this and he also contacted the Park Central Hotel who also had no problem with this outrageous price increase from the advertised price. And even better, now I am getting offers from Booking.com to for a reservation price of $110.

We stayed here for the NYC Marathon in 2013 and I choose it again for this special weekend because of it's great location and sizable rooms. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We were visiting New York from Miami during the coldest weekend in 100 years (I'm not exaggerating). The front desk upgraded our room to a corner room, partially I think because they felt bad that it was such a cold weekend... brrrr! The corner rooms as great and remarkable large compared to other NYC hotels I have stayed in. The ONLY complaint I have about the rooms, and I mean the ONLY complaint, is the shower heads. The water pressure isn't the best and the shower head is one of those rain fall types. Needless to say, I prefer a more high pressured shower head. I don't feel like the shampoo/conditioner washes out completely otherwise. Silly complaint, but that really is the only thing. It bothered me during my first stay and again during this stay. During this visit we stayed on the 9th floor. The elevator system is a hassle as there is only one set of elevators for an entire floor. And don't forget your room key or you won't be able to go up in the elevators at all, room key required.I would like to comment specifically about the Guest Services Manager, Elizabeth. She was incredibly helpful and friendly. She remembered from when we checked in that we were visiting for my daughters birthday. She offered suggestions for restaurants, taxi services, and then treated us to breakfast one morning so we could enjoy a quiet walk to Central Park. Did I mention the hotel is only 2 blocks from Central Park. One block from a subway terminal. And still walking distance from Time Square. Enough distance to enjoy the city without being overrun by the hustling/bustling crowd of New York City.Overall, this hotel is in a great location, at a consistently great rate, with great customer service and comfortable rooms.

Close to everything. However, we definitely had some problems. First, ensure you ask for a hotel no where near the elevators because they kept us up all night. The manager offered to give us a different room with a smaller bed, but we declined. She did wave the resort fee which was nice (note this btw! we booked with expedia, and in very fine print it was written that the hotel would charge $27 dollars a night for a resort fee) Secondly, if you request towels make sure to plan to wait at least an hour for them (this happened to us on two different occasions). We called the front desk numerous times during our trip, and to be honest they were less then helpful. Don't try to take a bath either, because the stopper is just there for show. I ended up using a towel to clog the bath. Finally, ensure you're okay with sleeping in a bed with no duvet cover, or fitted sheet.They just put our duvet cover between two flat sheets, and same thing for where the fitted sheet should be. I was totally grossed out because I move a lot during my sleep, and I woke up sleeping on the mattress topper. Like I said before, we called the front desk for so many issues during our trip i just don't think it's worth it.

We called the hotel restaurant to order some room service and it was closed: so far so good, as it was indeed late, although, again, in many hotels we have ordered food around the same time after a long flight.

To have privacy we had to close the curtains because we could see the other rooms, but that didnt bother us. The elevators worked just fine (I read in some reviews that they took forever), we didnt have to wait for more than 30 seconds and it was almost never full.The subway was right in the corner, and the hotel was walking distance to a lot of places like 5th av, times square, MoMa, Central Park, Columbus Circus.

I was already aware of that when we booked the hotel so it didnt come as a surprise, but I really think it isnt fair. We didnt even use the fitness center, just the wifi, and in the majority of the hotels that i have been is free. In the end of our stay we had to pay 150 dolars+tax.

They claim in the literature you can order coffee & breakfast danishes, muffins, fruit...from the in-hotel 'Starbucks' type shop but I never received a call back from the front desk to learn how to place the order. The lines in the morning were too long to wait and while the hours state it's open until 8:30 pm it closed early every night I was there. 2) No coffee maker or bottled water in the room. 3) Shower curtain hangs higher than the edge of the tub so water floods that edge of the bathroom unless you position the shower head to face the wall. 3) They forcibly charge a 'hotel fee' of $30ish per night to cover wifi (even if you don't use it) and the gym. My recommendation is the WestHouse hotel located on the same block as Park Central. Rooms are nicer, free drinks and lite fare every evening from 5 to 8pm. Free breakfast offering on 23rd floor every morning, staff excels at providing excellent service and offers to help with everything. In room FREE bottled water. Unfortunately no coffee maker in the room. No restaurant beyond breakfast offering but fantastic local restaurant arrangements for delivery.

So when I booked for the 2nd time and dealt with overbooking, needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I was booked for Tuesday night 2/2, checkout Wednesday 2/3. When I arrived at the hotel they told me they were overbooked and sent me to the Park Lane a few blocks away. My main issue is that I called at 7pm that night, Tuesday 2/2 to ask about the valet package. Long story short, for whatever reason the only way to add the valet package is to cancel your reservation and rebook. They couldn’t just simply add it to my reservation, which is crazy. Anyway, they couldn’t add the package because they were full so they couldn’t cancel my reservation and rebook. Point being, they saw they were full, they saw my reservation, yet didn’t say anything about being OVERbooked!By the time I got there it was 2.30am, which is why I asked about valet earlier that night by the way!! But the timing wasn’t why they were overbooked. They said they had to move many guests this week. So when I questioned the woman at the from desk at 2.30 in the morning astounded that they didn’t have a room for me, she was very rude and all she would say was that she would get me her manager. They ended up giving me $20 for cab fare to the Park Lane and to get to my office in the morning.When I checked out of the Park Lane on Wednesday 2/3, they told me they bill the room to the Park Central and that I would need to get a receipt from them.Later that same day I went to the Park Central to get the receipt. An extremely nice gentleman at Guest Relations, QUIMBY HIGHTOWER, was extremely apologetic, took my email and looked into the situation. Later that night I received an email from him that because the error with my reservation was a hotel error, they took full responsibility and the room to the Park Lane was paid by Park Central, so it was on them!This wont deter me from booking here again, or from going to the Park Lane, but I will definitely be calling ahead next time!","Farmingdale, New York",9,3.0

When I arrived at the hotel around 8pm, I was informed at the checking desk that the King bed classic room which I had pre-paid for via the Last Minute website was not available till 4pm the following day and only a Queen room was available that night.This is a concern, attending what Last Minute stated as a 4 star hotel and being informed that we would have to check out and check into a new room later in the day is unheard of along with unacceptable attitudes and behaviour. I would therefore waste a portion of my day waiting and returning to the hotel to check back in.Nevertheless as advised by the front desk staff, my girlfriend and I stayed in the Queen room that night and repacked in the morning returning to the front checking desk.We were informed that due to the snow storm that other guests had extended their stay and we would only have the Queen room we checked into at the start available to us. No apologies or offerings apart from the tax fee being removed. when they asked to take a $50 deposit the tax fee was actually fully charged to my card. After raising a compliant this fee has been returned to my credit card. The room was dusty as per the pictures I have taken. There was dust behind the bed and headboard which was exceptionally thick, clearly the room had never been dusted or vacuumed as the carpets and edges had dust and dirt everywhere. I actually found a make-up Q-tip lodged between the carpet and table obviously not one my girlfriend had brought with us.The bathroom had a shaving mirror where the outer and inner rim had dust surrounding. The shower sides had the rust colour residue indicating the bathroom had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. Only towels had been placed in our bathroom each day. Several of the towels received were torn which does not present the image of a four star hotel.Each day we expected a new soap bar replacement along with the replacement of the tissues that had been finished.

We were made to feel welcomed by all the staff at the hotel and they were all very helpful. The hotel is close to loads of attractions, like Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, Central Park & The Rockefeller Center which are all in walking distance and there's a subway and a bus stop right by the hotel so it's easy to get to other places too! The room was lovely and upon arrival the the receptionist had told us that they had upgraded our room to a corner room for no extra charge (usually another $90 per night). The room was spacious with a big TV and the bathroom wasn't small or cramped. The house keeping team were always polite and always left our room tidy and clean to high standard every day.The bar staff team always made you feel welcomed into the bar and Nancy (the waitress) always remembered our drinks order, brought them over to the table for us and always made the time to have a chat to us and ask us how our day had gone.What stopped me from rating this a 5 star hotel was that they had put a hold of $250 on my credit card without notifying me for accidentals. It was lucky that I wasn't using that $250 for spending money on my trip. I also feel that the cafe (central market) was over priced but there is a Starbucks next door which is cheaper. Overall I would really recommend this hotel for family's or couples looking to get a way for a while in New York. It's central, it's clean and the staff are polite. I would definitely come back here again. ","Neath Port Talbot, United Kingdom",6,4.0

The key for check in was about 10-15 people long. We waited around 40 minutes to check in, during which time members of staff could be seen doing nothing in the lobby yet no apology or explanation was provided to the ever increasing line. When we eventually reached the front desk we received no apology and were met by a very rude member of staff who didn't even look at us, let alone explain anything about the hotel. We were given one key and told we couldn't have any more. In the lift we found out from another guest (who had been given a key to another guest's room) that the computer system was down. But no explanation of the issues does not make up for poor customer service. Our room was very disappointing. The bath was tiny and the room was very dirty, in particular the floor looked like it had never been vacuumed. We were in a low down room - floor 3 (even though we actually paid for a high floor) and the noise from the air conditioning unit was unbearable. We had internet problems so the next day tried to enquire about this at reception but were met by a very rude member of staff who again did not make eye contact, say hello or any other pleasantries. One morning I went out for coffee and left the do not disturb sign on the door (husband was asleep). I came back 10 minutes later to be met by angry cleaners trying to get in the room - what's the point of a do not disturb sign if you are going to ignore it.On check out we were charged for extras on our room which we never had - such as upgrade to premium rooms etc. We did get this rectified but staff again were very unfriendly during this.Our stay here was the worst hotel stay we have ever had and did spoil the end of an otherwise fantastic stay in America.

I went back early January so I prepaid for 10 days since I got a great deal this way. On my 3rd day there I had a call from a family member explaining that my father was in the hospital so I had to rush home the next day. I explained the situation to Angela, who helped me a lot, and assured me she was going to explain the situation to the manager. The manager came over and assured me they will give me a refund for the rest of the stay that I prepaid. Angela helped me with getting a last minute ticket to Europe and the manager even brought me a bottle of water when he noticed how worried I was about my father. They did everything they could to help me. I also want to thank Emanuel Zayas who helped me get a great room this last time when I emailed in advance before my arrival, a high floor room with great view of Times Square and even a mini fridge I asked for in advance. The hotel bar is really nice and the rooms are comfortable and elegant. Times square is only three or fourth blocks away, Broadway, several Starbucks near by and very close to 5th Ave. I highly recommend Park Central. I will certainly go back to this hotel soon, not just because it is a great hotel but because I always feel at home here and the staff is the best.",USA,12,5.0

The room we were allocated was very nice, easily a 4 star with brilliant views down to Times Square. The room was cleaned daily and the bed was very comfortable, we were really happy with the room. The bar area is nice but was too expensive for us to have more than one drink there. The Deli shop stocks good food, but again, far too expensive. The staff were fine, we didn't have a problem with anyone as I've read in other reviews, but I wouldn't describe it as great service either. The location is perfect and a real plus for anyone wanting to visit the tourist attractions.We did have a bad experience on our last night but not all down to the hotel. A strong smell of weed came under the door from another room. It got stronger to the point I felt sick and eyes were stinging. No-one answered when we called reception several times. My partner had to get dressed and went down and informed the staff, they said they would send security up. The fumes were awful. I didn't hear anyone come up to check it out but it did stop a while later. Apparently they didn't appear overly concerned. Luckily we didn't have children with us.Overall in my opinion this is an average hotel, given all of the above.","Manchester, United Kingdom",6,3.0

Cons: No room service (a drag when you don't want to go out); room could use a little repair; no view whatsoever (I felt as if I was staying in a cave as my window faced a brick wall and was above some sort of blocked in alley -- but I did not expect a view in this part of NYC); a huge, eerie picture of a multicolored head hung above the toilet and made me feel as if I were being watched while in the bathroom.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ",5,3.0

Even though the hotel has a couple of good things, I would not recommend you to stay at this hotel.First of all, it is really central located, but I would say that is the only thing good about this hotel.The bed is also confortable, but I must say, I had to sleep in a not very clean room, because the wall at the entrance of the room and at the bathroom-furniture were dirty. I reported that immediately and the hotel sent at the next day the cleaning-staff. I think, for the price you pay at this hotel, you should get from the beginning a clean room, don´t you think so?The hotel is really huge, that means, there are a lot of tourists in there, the problem is, for a very big amount of people, there are only two elevators, and if you want to go into your room or out of the hotel, you have to wait at least 5 minutes on the elevator-line.I payed in advance a stay with a ""one dollar breakfast package at the central market"" and the hotel charged on my credit card 31 Dollar. I saw that in the check out- sheet, that the hotel left at the morning of my departure in my room and I went down to the reception in order to get an explanation. The man at the front desk told me that was a mistake and that they would not charge me anything. THAT WAS A BIG LIE!!! I believed that and went home. Then I realise that the amount was charged in my credit card. I wrote a mail on December 31st and I haven´t received neither an answer nor my refund.Also, you can hear noises from the upper room.The last thing I have to say is that the atmosphere at this hotel is really impersonal, I mean, they treat you really cold, and I didn´t feel that somebody really care.For the price you pay, you would certainly find better options in NY.","Mexico City, Mexico",21,2.0

While the design team obviously gave some great thought in making the best possible use of available space, the space between the bed and the dresser, desk, bench was so narrow that we could barely walk by without turning our bodies sideways. This definitely got annoying after awhile and if we had been staying for more than a night or two at the most, it would have driven us totally bonkers! My husband did get a great rate through Priceline, so this may have attributed to the given room choice (although we were staying in an upgraded room). While we we checking out I peeked into two other rooms that were getting cleaned and they were much more spacious.NegativeNothing really stood out here. My only comment is that the concierge ladies should act a bit less snooty. The attitude was subtle, but there nonetheless. It was 'let me listen with a fake smile, give a very quick answer along with the 'eyes' so they will hurry away and let me finish my conversation' I guess this stood out even more because every other hotel employee we had contact with was genuinely nice and helpfulWould I go back again....absolutely!

This review is somewhat similar but I believe that there are some upside to this hotel and they deserve that bit of respect.First, this hotel is in the perfect location just outside the hustle and bustle of Time Square and 2 blocks from the south end of Central Park. It is situated where everything is within walking distance and not at the cost of those hotels on Times Square. This is not a high end Four Seasons or Plaza but is a great mid range hotel. It has a classy feel and it is a respected property. The rooms are modern, clean and well laid out and the beds are very comfortable. Check in and check out was efficient and the staff were pleasant.Now the bad, elevators are very slow as some have written about, that has to be taken care of. When we checked into the hotel in the evening our rooms heater did not work. So we reported it to the management and they said they will take care of it. We just got in and wanted to get something to eat so we said ok, we will go out to eat and when we get back we will check with you. So we went out to eat (hotel does not have a dedicated restaurant), took a quick walk around Times Square and then returned. When we returned and talked with the staff we talked to earlier, he advised it was repaired and it was only the filter. We went to the room and it was still cold (January???). So we reported it to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer. He responded 20 minutes later, did some checks and said it was not repairable (funny at 12 midnight that he was not the one who supposedly repaired it earlier). So he said that he will report it to the front desk and they will contact us by phone. Another 30 minutes passed and no call. Whet downstairs and talked with the front desk and she didn't know anything about it. So they said hang out until someone checks the room they will put us in and they will send a bellman up to move us to the new room. He showed up with the key and said he was only delivering the key so he had no idea he was to move our bags. So they got us another room lower floor, 2 queens, no view except a interior brick wall with no natural light, and the hotel machinery just below. We moved in and it was plenty hot as they had the heater at 80 degrees. Funny, we had a reservation for a high floor and a King. We didn't get what we booked and we even informed them we were a late check in. Yes they comp'd the resort fee and even said if we wanted to get a higher floor they would take care of it the next day. So they tried to make it right, we decided it was more of a hassle to try to get the other room as we had only 4 days in the city and a lot to see. I was not appreciative of the fact it was late night/early morning and the lack of urgency and I don't know if I believe what the night manager told me about the repair. But it is what it is, and I did not want to let this ruin our long weekend. My wife would like to add that in both rooms, the lighting in the bathrooms are very poor, light in the mirror, or the spot behind you head, so you see a lot of shadows. Finally, if you are one that gets what you booked and did not have any issues, this hotel is worth trying for the price and it is close to everything in Manhattan.","Tracy, California",2,3.0

There is a small cafe downstairs if you want to grab coffee, soft drinks, muffins, bagels, etc. The concierge and front desk managers were very attentive and helpful, too! We will be back again next Christmas, and I've already recommended the Park Central Hotel to several friends! And, of course, being in NYC at Christmas time is just amazing!",Tennessee,6,5.0

Took a while to check in, but the front desk was really helpful. The rooms are large (for a capital city), newly refurbished and smart, with large flat screen TVs. No tea and coffee facilities in room, which is disappointing for Europeans; yes you can get it in the lobby but not naked...... if you get what i mean!There are other reviews that mention surly staff; yes we noticed this to, but only some not all. But a number of staff made sure you knew a tip was expected; well this is USA and most travellers know this and don't need reminding; not nice.Again, others have mentioned the food (lack of a restaurant) and we heard guests complaining about the breakfast package. There is a food servery at the back of the bar. Overall I rated the hotel very good, in particular because it is nicely appointed and was good value. TOP TIP eat breakfast out. There is a fab bakery ""Fluffys"" opposite where a good breakfast with coffee is $7 or a big plate with coffee $11, or nearby try the Brooklyn diner (finer diner) maybe for brunch; bit dearer but really nice food in a traditional diner (neons and all!) setting.","London, United Kingdom",35,4.0

I'm not one to write a negative review, but me and my partner were a bit disappointed with this hotel. Upon arrival there was around 8/9 people checking in with only one member of staff so we were queueing for awhile. Room was clean and quite modern which was nice. Unfortunately there are only two lifts available and being a hotel with 20+ floors this is quite inconvenient as we often found ourselves waiting awhile for the lift. BE AWARE - there is a mandatory fee of $25 plus tax per night that you stay in this hotel. They claim it is for use of the computers, gym and luggage storage. When we informed the lady we didn't need any of those services she said it is a mandatory fee that we would have already been told about at booking. This had never been mentioned to us previously, and we were told that we had to pay the fee or we couldn't stay. This was a bit disappointing as this is quite a large charge considering non of the services were necessary for us at all. The one thing I would say that is fantastic about this hotel is its location. It is 2 blocks away from Central Park, and a short 5-10 minutes walk from Times Square. It truly is in a fantastic location!! All in all we were slightly disappointed with the hotel, but if you wouldn't mind waiting around awhile and paying the extra charges then I would recommend this hotel simply for its location.

We were travelling to Washington on the train so didn't want to take big suitcases with us, but we had no choice. Hotel was clean, but only two lifts available to each of the floors which means waiting around for ages at busy times. Also the additional charge of $25 per night + tax is just a rip off. Most people are on holiday and are not going to use the hotel facilities that this charge apparently covers. The only thing that most people are likely to use is wifi, which really wouldn't cost that much per night anywhere. Not sure how the hotel gets away with making the charge mandatory in all honesty.

The hotel was overbooked on arrival and we had to stay in another terrible hotel nearby. I even forgot the name but it was no comparison. The hotel arranged taxis (impressive they were and an atraction on themselves). After one night staying somewhere else we were welcomed and got upgraded rooms.We hardly ever had such large rooms in New York (we came to NY before) It was so fantastic that after some maby years I still welcome their newletters every time I see them. The hotel room had a super kingsize bed, large sofa, obviously the minibar and the rooms were facing the street where Carnagie Hall is located down the road. Only a few blocks away from Central Park.With hotels, thus this one as well, their sizes and even their lobbys are so big that your still amazed after a few days.Personel behind hte counter were friendly as ever. The only downside we had is that my friends daughter lost their Ipod supposedly stolen from their room. Through filing a few forms and months later this was compensated.

I booked 2 rooms as I have 3 adult and 2 minors, we travelled from Asia and as expected, we have a lot of bags and stuff. Everyday, my rooms are last to clean, there was two nights, we came back after dinner and rooms are in cleaning process. The house keeping was very unfriendly to my family members until I give more TIP. What kind of service attitude is this? I strongly felt that the staffs in this hotel need a lot of trainings. We are frequent travellers and this hotel has the worst service I ever seen (for an international 4 star standard). Also, the hotel charge a facility fee of USD 25/day/room and with 2 small lifts servicing the entire hotel guests (not to mentioned that there was a day when one of the two lifts actually broke down and I waited more than 20 minutes for the lift...) You must be joking!! Wifi is ok though.In short, with the kind of service I received (except the Duty Manager, He/She were friendly), I will never consider staying in this hotel again regardless of how good the location might be.

Clean, nicely-appointed rooms. It's not much more than that. Service is average. Staffing seemed a bit low. There are little details that upscale/luxury hotels excel at that were missing. We stayed a weekend in January and reserved two adjoining rooms but they sold them out from under us when we arrived a couple of hours late. We had our 14-year-old daughter and a friend with us so having them on the other end of the floor wasn't acceptable. They eventually accommodated us, and after going to dinner, we got two adjacent rooms. But no towels in one of them. We called down at around 10:30 after walking around midtown for a bit and were told the hotel was out of clean towels. A second call produced the towels about 45 minutes later. I stopped at the front desk because my daughter forgot her toothbrush. They were willing to help, but would not give me a toothbrush, only send it to the room. I didn't feel like waiting for that so I bought one at a nearby drugstore. The small elevators in the hotel aren't large enough to serve all the guests and there are occasionally lines at busy times. Other than that, the rooms were small, but clean and modern and had most of what we needed including a mini fridge. No in-room coffee, but three options to buy coffee on the same block, including a small cafe in the hotel.","Chalfont, PA",25,3.0

I finally decided on Park Central as it was a combination of a lot of things and not too compromising.Leading up to our arrival, I had been informed from other friends who had recently visited the city, that their hotel was able to arrange airport transport from JFK to the actual hotel so I tried to see if I can have park central arrange this for me.I looked through all of my hotel booking emails and could not find an email address. I then decided to go onto the park central website and submit an enquiry which I didnt get a reply from. It was getting closer and closer to my departure date and i still had nothing sorted so I took to the park central facebook page and left a comment for them to see. After I still did not get an answer, I sent them a private message on facebook. They read the mail but did not reply. Already, I was getting a bad impression about the hotel and I hadnt even left Scotland yet. I kept trying and eventually I got some to reply to which they just sent me a link to a 3rd party car hire company. Now at this point, I could have easily and quickly arranged my own transport but the fact that the hotel was ignoring my requests and messages made me even more determined to get them to reply.After a couple weeks of trying and trying to just get some kind of correspondence going from someone at the hotel. I gave up and set my mind to taking it up with management on arrival. Surly enough, once i arrived at the hotel, i immediately asked to speak to a manager and stated the problems I had been having. The gentleman on reception and the manager on shift were both very nice and even wavered the $100 city tax fee and upgraded me to a better room,The hotel itself is lovely, is perfectly located on 7th avenue for a stroll down to times square or a stroll a couple blocks up to central park. There is a starbucks next door and a subway on the other side of the road which I thought was quite handy.On our last day, British Airways had cancelled our flight and put us onto a much earlier flight so we had to rush back to the hotel and ask to use their telephone to phone BA. The female concierge was very accommodating and let us use her phone and even rearranged our airport transport for getting back to JFK.Now that I have been to nyc already and I know where to go to get transport to the hotels etc, I would probably have a much more enjoyable experience and would probably stay at the park central again providing the price was as good. I would however, advise the hotel to put a system in place to help new travelers to the city get to the hotel in the days and weeks leading up to their trip.","Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom",4,4.0

Quick access to subway from the hotel. Attractive hotel with decent value. We slept well - the air unit in the room allowed for manual fan control, which provided enough white noise to block out the ubiquitous honking of taxi cabs and never ending screams of emergency vehicles. Comfortable bed with lots of pillows.Molasses-SLOW service at check in. ONE person on desk to service a line several travelers deep. I pre-registered at the hotel the morning of the 29th (around 10:30AM) when I arrived and stored my luggage with the friendly bell hop. When we finally finished up our day of sightseeing and events at 9:30PM, it took 30 minutes to finally get access to my room keys, even though I had pre-registered earlier that morning. REALLY bad experience at front desk overshadowed the other positives.Other than that, the hotel was great and a good deal based on the price I paid.One other note - the hotel charges a mandatory $25 to cover workout fees and amenities that I didn't even use. They inform you of this ridiculous surcharge upon check-in.

My family and I travelled to New York to visit extended family for Thanksgiving.The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. The room was spotless, tidy and well appointed. It was spacious enough for our needs. It was also in a quiet and peaceful location of the hotel.We chose the hotel due to the route of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade, however what was unexpected was the proximity to absolutely everything! It was a 10 minute walk (or thereabouts) to all the attractions we wanted. Central Park, Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, the Empire State Building and other New York landmarks were all in walking distance from the hotel. This is an added bonus when travelling with a three-year-old!We walked most places and took cabs or the subway when we couldn't walk any more.The only two downsides to the hotel is that it didn't have it's own restaurant - but there were many many restaurants and diners within a stones throw - and that we had some children's clothes laundered.My child's laundry cost $83, which we thought was extortionate for the size and quantity of the laundry. That said, my son's underwear did come back beautifully presented in a tissue-lined box! But it still wasn't worth $83 for laundry.If we stayed again we would not have anything laundered and would find a laundromat instead.The additional fees for wifi and the gym did bump up the cost of the hotel stay as well.

The lady sent the people in front of her to a fancy restaurant and the helpful person sent my sister to what she thought was a more ""affordable"" option, a diner. We ended up going to this other restaurant where we were kindly greeted by a big butt statue as we walked through the door. When we took a shower, the faucet for the bath was falling of and leaking creating a mini water park experience in the bathroom. The curtain was very short and got water on the floor allowing us to have a fun foot slip and slide. Water must have been a hip theme because the sink got water everywhere. They were very Eco-friendly. They conserve soap by only give you a 2""x2"" bar. They also conserve energy by having outlets that did not work in the bathroom. They conserve water by having weak water pressure in the shower and the toilet. They once again helped us to disconnect because there were no movie rental options or guide on the tv.

Boasting the characteristics of glamorous and sophisticated, the hotel's attributes, including its physical structure and the service providers, were polar opposites. During our stay we experienced the unsightly visual of 3-4 housekeeping carts laden with trash & soiled laundry outside our door daily throughout our 5 day stay (not just during ""cleaning hours"") despite NUMEROUS (3+) requests for attention to the matter. The manager even implied that such aesthetics is normative, which is hardly true, not even at 2 star chains like La Quinta, where (also) requests are typically met on the first attempt versus the 3 required for us to get a coffee pot. The manager seemed oblivious as to why we might not enjoy viewing cleaning carts and verbalized powerlessness (no ""control"" over housekeeping) to change the situation & belabored us with info regarding the facility's inadequacy to actually store the carts. Ironically, the housekeeping staff with whom I spoke referred me to management. All this complimented our having received no greeting (customary at nicer hotels as this purports to be) - NOT ONE - from any staff member upon our countless entries/exits. The comforters were threadbare and visibly soiled upon our arrival. The walls were adorned with LOW quality ""art"" and empty hooks. Rooms were poorly insulated: window side of room was actually cold (despite above average exterior temperatures), and urinary functions in room next door were audible. Part of the lounge was closed, & the cocktails were barely average despite a price point equalling superiorly crafted ones at nearby establishments like Serafina.

Don, quick lesson in client satisfaction, even something small like comping your resort fee, giving a late check out (when I told you we were leaving late in the day) or the upgrade fee for a day or 2 which costs you nothing, can go a long way in retaining customers and helping to spread good Customer Satisfaction. It is the little things that show you care that make a stay memorable and insure return visits.Your hotel was sure on the ball when we were returned on our last day at 11:50 to get our bags only to find our keys were shut off due to the 12:00 check out.

I wish I could have said the same for the other reception staff because everything else was 5 star apart from them, they really let the hotel down, at one time when one man was taking our deposit from us he said it was $50 a night so when he took the money I realised it didn't add up right so I let him know that he had taken about $20 too much which isn't a lot at all but his reply was very sharp and short "" yeah so I made a mistake adding up, I may of added $20 too much is that a problem you'll get it back alright"" For the first time ever I was actually speechless at someone's response, maybe it is a cultural thing but to me that was just plain rude not even to apologise first for his mistake. We had a few other instances like that with staff which got tiring. The rooms were lovely and clean and housekeeping was to such a high standard. The rooms on the inside of the hotel were cramped and dark due to them all facing the three walls of the middle of the hotel considering we paid a lot for a nice room we were unhappy to have got this room but Brian helped up to change rooms luckily because the next room we got faced the street and was lovely and spacious. So the rest of the week that we didn't have to have any contact with the other reception staff the stay we had was lovely. ",Uk,6,3.0

In addition, it is only a few blocks away from Central Park, truly making it a perfect location. Excellent service, for the most part, however, they did not fix a few issues that we had with our room (that was politely brought to their attention) which kept this review from being one of the best values for the dollar I have ever experienced. We booked way in advance (6 months) and got non-refundable rooms that saved us several hundred dollars. The rooms are well appointed, however, if you are not familiar with room sizes in Manhattan you may be disappointed by how tight they are. These rooms are a very nice size, actually, considering the other hotels that I have stayed in. Fresh upgrades, new renovations give this hotel an upscale Manhattan feel (you want that, don't you!?) and the team of people working here are overall very, very capable. I feel as though this hotel COULD be more if they followed through with the issues of their customers. Located on 7th Ave. all you have to do is walk out of the hotel and turn left (Central Park) or turn right (Times Square) and you are right in the middle of everything. I recommend this hotel and look forward to giving this property one more chance at finding excellence.","Chippewa, Pennsylvania",36,4.0

Then last year they did a substantial remodel. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the location is really great. But this hotel hardly has the amenities a 4-star would. No coffee-maker in the room. Not even a book of hotel services. And the building is woefully underserved by elevators. Only two lifts on either side of the building and you have to wait forever. But while these are annoyances, the hotel is still comfortable and fine.What's REALLY galling though, is that they have the nerve to charge a mandatory daily $27 ""resort fee""! The fee is for (as the accompanying picture to this review shows) ""unlimited phone calls"" from your room, the fitness center, and use of the iMac computers in the lobby. When was the last time you used the hotel phone? (who doesn't use their own these days?). Didn't use the fitness center. And why would I use the lobby computer? I didn't use any of these ""services"" and I still had to pay the mandatory fee. Talk about being ripped off. What's next, a mandatory surcharge for the air you breathe? Or a ""convenience"" charge for the attention of the front desk attendant? This is a nice hotel, but it offers just the basic minimal services. To then be charged for the few amenities it does offer is cheap and non-welcoming. But to be charged for ""services"" you're not using is an outrageous rip-off. I wonder how many quests would actually even pay for these things if you offered them as premium fee services. Not many, I'm guessing. In the meantime, I suspect charging the fee, while it might generate some short-term revenue, will cost them much over the long term in lost business.","Seattle, Washington",3,3.0

We did find the room a little on the small side but with a baby and having to settle in early each night, we probably spent more time in it than would have done without the little one. We had asked for a cot, which the manager had agreed by email way ahead of our stay, however this did not materialise and as we ended up bringing our own travel cot with us, did not make a fuss. One of our baby's towels was taken with the laundry after our first night - we should have bought coloured towels for him - the staff were not that fussed that this had happened and although we filled out the paperwork, we knew no real effort would be made to find and return it to us. Disappointing.However, as there is no restaurant or room service, it was helpful how close the hotel was to food outlets as we had to eat in our room each night and its location to the MTA and Times Square made walking around Manhattan nice and easy.We did enjoy our stay there and even though there were a few hiccups, we would probably stay there again, due to its location.","Aberaeron, United Kingdom",13,4.0

Really you couldn't ask for a better location, with a Starbucks on the corner and the subway right beside it. The beds are comfortable. After having a problem with are room we were moved no problem. Negatives: No restaurant, no way of getting any food unless you want to pay a crazy amount of money for the small ""market"" down stairs. The lifts are horrendously slow, had to wait 5 minutes very time. BE AWARE of room 303, right next to the gym all you'll hear is weights being dropped at all times of the night, and your paying $25.00 for this gym even if you don't use it!!!! (Although when we addressed the problem we where moved) Unfortunately on are family trip we all ended up getting the flu, but with the strangely high temperatures for this time of year we where told that we would not be able to put the heating on in the room! Seriously, 3 sick people with the flu being told that they can't turn on the heating because it's beyond there control. Service is slow and like being served by characters from the walking dead. No sense of urgency appears to be present in this city at all. Also after asking twice for a new tub of body wash a family of three where left to use one very small bar of soap. I can safely say that I will not be back at this hotel, and I urge others to consider if they are happy with paying s considerable amount of money for nothing. ","Jasper, Canada",8,1.0

I met friends at the hotel and we were in town to see La Boheme at the Met. My friends arrived a day earlier and texted me a picture from the lobby where there was close to an hour long line for them to check in. After I checked in and go to my room I discovered discarded shopping bags left by the previous guest in plain view on the bench next to the bed and missed by the cleaning staff. My TV remote was not working and the a/c was inoperative on the hottest day in December on record. Hotel staff (after two calls regarding the a/c) dumped a fan in my room but didn't bother to set it up or turn it on to call the room off before I returned. The wait for the elevators was at least 15-20 minutes each trip and they only have two dedicated elevators on either side of the hotel. The elevators are also quite small. The combination of all these problems made for an extremely unpleasant experience. Guest Services at first promised to give me a 30% rate reduction off my room rate and then attempted to renege on the discount several hours later. I finally spoke with another manager on duty who made good on the discount and also gave me an extra late check out. The line for check out and the line for luggage storage was at least 45 minutes. These concessions were appreciated but did nothing to lessen the impact of the bad overall experience. Clearly this hotel does not have enough elevators to handle a full house nor sufficient staff to provide reasonable check in and luggage service wait times. They need to update their a/c systems and do a better job of monitoring maid services. I will not be back any time soon.,"Atlanta, Georgia",6,2.0

When I first entered the hotel there was a line out the door to check in. Once it was my turn to check in, I didn't even get so much as a ""sorry for the wait"". The room was small, the bathroom was so small you couldn't even turn around in, the shower was open making for a wet bathroom floor after every shower. The room was so hot all the time, we called the front desk asking if there was any way to cool our room down as obviously the thermostat in our room didn't work. They said they would send someone up to check it out, needless to say they said it was fine and working properly but it remained so hot in the room the whole stay it was so uncomfortable. The first morning we were there we went to try and ask the concierge for help and boy did she blow us off. She was so rude and didn't help us at all. Needless to say, we were stuck trying to figure everything out on our own. Nobody we encountered in the hotel was overly friendly, so definitely F for service.

The rooms are nicely decorated, but basic. We stayed on the 16th floor and thankfully didn't really have any issues with the lifts as others have mentioned, although our keys stopped working the day before we were due to check out. Our room was well serviced and replenished with fresh towels when needed (just place them in the bath to have them changed), however, we did find that the shower curtain was around 2 inches too short, which lead to a wet bathroom floor. We did miss not having a tea tray with kettle in the room and a mini fridge - it would have enhanced our stay (we ventured to the nearest Starbucks rather than purchasing from the very expensive shop within the hotel).

We booked a corner 2 x Queen bed room and we were not disappointed. Firstly, the positives, we found the room very clean, nice toiletries, good powerful hairdryer, comfy beds. The bar area was very nice, stylish and comfortable. Great view up 7th Avenue towards Times Square. Great location and staff seemed mostly helpful. We used one of their private cars back to Newark airport which was very comfortable and $90 flat rate. Negatives: As we booked through Expedia, I contacted the hotel to advise that there would be 4 of us and not 2 (the others were flying in from other places. I received confirmation of this. On 2 occasions, I was contacted by the hotel with various confirmations and welcome emails with the reservation saying the booking was for 2 people - which prompted me to check this. When they always confirmed it was for 4. However, on arrival in our room we received towels for 3 people, free drinks vouchers for 2 people and free chocolates (delicious) for 2 people. Although none of this was a huge deal, it would have been nice to have more acknowledgement of the 4 of us. Every day when housekeeping serviced our room they took away the towels again (clean or dirty) and left us 3 sets - which required a a call to housekeeping. They were always prompt and it wasn't a huge deal, just a bit annoying. The hotel bar doesn't open until 5pm, which was a little frustrating as we found we often would have used it at other times of the day had it been open. However the drinks were pleasant and came with lovely table snacks. There is no restaurant, which we knew but found the 'Central Market' coffee shop to be pretty small and very expensive. A tub of nuts, 2 packets of crisps and a packet of M&Ms = $15. As we visited in December, AC wasn't an issue for us (as commented on in other reviews) there was a large under window unit which seemed to heat/cool the room as necessary. Seemed pretty efficient, although a little noisy but no huge complaints. We were on the 18th floor and the room was quite noisy from street buzz. But we just accepted this as the NYC noise and it didn't stop us sleeping etc as we got used to it very quickly. Might be worth requesting a quieter room if you have kids though. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square, 5 minute walk to Central Park, 10-15 mins to 5th Avenue and 2 mins from Ellen's Stardust Diner - which was great fun!

The beds were very comfortable.For the ""ah well...not a big deal""...there could have been a minibar even with just water and or soda. Maybe some overpriced snacks and a few cold expensive beers. We only stayed one night and I think you could have added another $50-60 to our bill with that.For the poor I will try to be polite as I can. The building has no AC, which is understandable. But if your hotel is $500+ a night and has no AC, perhaps that should be mentioned somewhere? Upon mentioning that there may be an issue with the AC (and learning there is none in the building from a young lady who clearly was having a rough day or hates her job) we were told to open our window. We did open the window the entire 4 inches we are allowed, and it didn't help at all. I understand that it is unseasonably warm, but a little kindness and perhaps having an idea when we paid the $500 that we would be sweating all night would have been nice.Upon checkout we mentioned the AC/Heat issue (not because we were asked how our stay was...no one seemed to care) and were blown off all together and were rushed to pay for the room so they could get to other (presumably) more important customers. Other highlights from the room that no one appeared concerned with at the front desk: Long hairs folded into one of our towels (very gross); short hairs all over the sink and tub (moderately gross); a shower curtain that was not long enough to cover the length to the tub and appeared made of cotton, leading us to use most of our towels to wipe up the soaking wet bathroom floor after every shower; and a carpet that had more hair on it than the bathroom.I have stayed at quite a few $500 hotels in New York at different parts of the year and in different areas in the city. This is the first poor review I have left for those or any other hotel. The majority of the errors could have been corrected with kindness and better communication, both were lacking. You will be happy to know that I did not make a scene in the lobby as we checked out. That is not my style. However I will be honest on this survey, to my colleagues, friends, and family, and on any website that would ask my thoughts about your business. We were shocked and actually angry after checkout.

The ice machine on my floor was broken during my entire stay.I had issues with housekeeping while there. If you are on an 'early' housekeeping floor and there is a do not disturb sign on your door, housekeeping will not come back later in the morning to service your room. I learned this the hard way. After leaving the room around 10 am I removed the do not disturb sign from the door and went about my day assuming that my room would be made up while I was away. I returned at 7pm to shower and freshen up for dinner only to discover that my room had not been touched. I called the hotel operator to see if I could get service, but housekeeping had already left. I asked for some towels to be brought up to my room. It took over an hour and a half to obtain towels. I even offered to get them myself. Needless to say I missed dinner that night.Every morning since then I had to call housekeeping before leaving my room in order to ensure service. I asked to speak to the manager about my experience. The operator told me that the message would be given to the manager.

Just 2 shorts blocks from Central Park, you can't beat the location. We easily walked from the hotel to Columbus Circle, the Central park zoo, and Rockefeller Center. We booked a package deal that included valet for only an additional $10. After reading some reviews, we were not expecting to have a very easy time with the valet but it was painless. There were spots in front of the hotel and a valet attendant outside. We told him we were staying 2 days, took a valet ticket, and he helped us with our bags. We were a little early so we checked in but our room wasn't ready yet and we weren't willing to accept a double bed room (they offered) so we elected to have the hotel hold our bags while we got an early dinner. (Tip: Eat at Angelo's pizza nearby!) Our room had a king bed and was a little small, but for New York and the location, I would not have expected anything better. It was CLEAN and modern. It was also remarkably quiet. We didn't have a view, but you can spend more for an upgrade and get a view of Times Square. The bathroom was also on the small side and my only pet peeve was that they didn't give you personal shampoos and body wash, only wall-mounted dispensers. I know they are locked and can't be removed or tampered with (hopefully), but I would really have preferred my own. But again, for the price and location it seems like such a trivial complaint. I'll bring my own shampoo!Check out was quick and the valet brought our car within 15 minutes, not the hour that some other reviewers have stated. But just to note: parking in New York City is a bear. Seriously. Try to park yourself anywhere. To have a valet at all is fantastic. And if you are staying during a busy time, they may have to move cars to get to yours. Or you may be the 4th car they have to get that morning. Have some patience. Go next door and get a coffee from Starbucks while you wait. I would definitely stay here again.","Bel Air, Maryland",4,4.0

Good television with lots of channels, there was a big book about NYC in there which went through things you can do which was interesting. However the rooms can be a little noisy, traffic is a given, that's what we expected being in a big city, but the walls are fairly thin and you can hear the conversations of the people next door. The rooms were comfy, beds were nice and big with good pillows and a very good mattress so sleep quality was good.Location - excellent location, this was the real perk of the hotel. Very close to the subway station and can get to other parts of New York on the R line very easily, including the World Trade Centre which was useful. It is around a ten minute walk from Times Square and therefore has a huge range of great restaurants to eat from, I saw someone mentioned on here they were disappointed no room service was available, but you do not need this when there are so many great eateries right on your door step. It is less than ten minutes to get up to Central Park, in my opinion you are in one of the best places in the whole of Manhattan and therefore I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know going to NYC.The hotel - the hotel itself is nice from what I saw of it, I didn't spend much time in the room or in the hotel as we spent most of our time sightseeing. There is a lovely coffee shop downstairs in the lobby. The bad - what I did not like about this hotel was the resort fees. $25 a DAY for something we did not need. This apparently covers things like wifi and the fitness centre. This made me angry and put a real downer on the trio as we got a bill for $165 at the end of our trip which we received no benefit from. My phone plan allows me to use data abroad free of charge so I did not even use the wifi. I understand some hotels have these fees. In Sarasota we paid $15 a night but with that we were able to use the kayaks, boats, paddle boards, as well as the beautiful swimming pools, pool service, and included shuttles into the town. At Park Central I just felt like the resort fees were daylight robbery and whilst I want to recommend this hotel to friends and family, this is what could hold me back. I am a travel agent and have used this hotel for clients before but this will make a difference in my choice next time. Lastly, there are only two lifts so you end up waiting a long time to get up and down from your rooms. These cannot fit many people in, especially when carrying suitcases, and one of the lifts was out of order during our stay which doubled the problem.","London, United Kingdom",118,4.0

Park Central was a great choice for location but sparse in amenities. No coffee maker, fridge, vending machines at the ice machines, no room service, no information in room about what the facility offered or what attractions were close by.Poor planning at registration desk. Two people were working, six families/couples waiting to check in on a Friday evening, the start of the holiday weekend. Our first night, was so cold because the heater did not work, that I slept with my down jacket AND North Face parka. (Read other reviews, seem to be a common complaint.)Called down the next morning to ask to fix heater, fix desk lamp, and 2 extra blankets. I think they fixed the heater, but was still cold.Blankets didn't get delivered til the LAST night of stay, and the broken desk lamp was left in the room on the floor, still plugged in all 4 nights. The room also had a sour smell like damp laundry, and housekeeping left used glasses with melted ice in the bucket after cleaning the room. I asked for clean glasses and new plastic bag for the ice bucket and got the clean glasses the next day but the used plastic was still in the bucket. On the third day, we got clean glasses and 2 plastic bags for the ice bucket.

Decor modern & simple.It was dark even during the day as it was in a quadrangle just looking onto the other rooms - but, on the plus side this made it nice & quiet at night when the city is very noisy.There was a huge flat screen TV & full length mirror.No fridge or coffee machine, but we asked for a coffee machine & one was sent up straight away.There is a good size wardrobe - again we asked for more hangers - it has a small safe too.The bathroom was well lit & had a huge illuminated mirror - plenty of towels & tissues - bath with overhead shower. All clean.There was shower gel, soap, shampoo & conditioner.The lobby was clean & good decor - 15 mins free computer access with printer too.The lounge areas are lovely - nice bar & seating area.There is no restaurant just a small shop which sells pastries, drinks etc.... We thought it was expensive & there are lots of places to grab breakfast outside the hotel.We left on 16th & after check out the hotel store your luggage until you need it.We booked the hotel car to the airport home - we though it would be expensive but to JFK it was $64. The yellow cab to arrive was $58, and unknown cost to return, so it was handier & very comfy.I would definitely stay here again. Well done Park Central.","Halifax,England",48,4.0

We didn't ask about concierge to take up our bags but none was offered in any case. We were put in room next to fitness center - the noise was terrible. Every pounding foot on the running machine sent a shudder into our room. It was annoying. Had I been alone I perhaps would have complained but the thought of repacking made me reconsider. The room was a reasonable size. We were three people in a room - there wasn't enough space for our stuff. There was one small closet and eight drawers. No where to put all our luggage / suitcases. We made the most of the cramped conditions but we could have done with some more space. Again, I could have said something but I didn't want to move rooms. We asked them to provide a fridge to the room which they were quick to say yes to, but to actually receive it took a day, four calls, and a visit to the front desk. But it was sorted in the end.

Few minor complaints: front desk experience could be improved. They had this sort of ""path/waiting area"" roped off and it you waited in there, no one else did and they just walked up to the desk and the employees served them. Another time, quite the opposite happened. I had been the only one there so I walked up to the desk and there was no staff there. When the staff arrived, she ignored me and called over the guy far away who was standing in the small ""path."" When I, right under her nose, said I was first, she was totally rude. When I pulled up in front of the hotel after a stressful drive in the city, no one approached my car, although they have valet parking. There was no valet stand and no one in uniform. I even got out and went onto the sidewalk looking for help and couldn't find anyone to approach. This caused me a lot of wasted time driving around the block to see if I could find their garage. Finally, on s second attempt, I saw what appeared to be a valet (all black uniform didn't look like an obvious uniform), I was helped. When I only had large bills and couldn't tip, he was gruff with me. Lighting in room was very bright/harsh and in the bathroom, a flourescent ring around the mirror was not enough to put on makeup. There was only one bar of soap near the sink and I got in the shower excited to use the body wash provided but couldn't get it to come out. So, I had to get out all wet to retrieve the one bar of soap by the sink. Room was modern and generally attractive but you could tell they remodeled an old building kind of on the cheap. Beds were very comfortable though. They honored my request for a high floor and quiet room. It was at the end of a hall but faced a brick wall. No biggie in the city but not optimal.

There was no apology that the room I had specifically booked was not available. The staff was smiling but not apologetic or sympathetic to their mix up and that was a theme which continued from all the staff we spoke to at the hotel, they were ignorant and very 'matter of fact' which was rude. In the UK staff are encouraged to be engaging and helpful, not here. The only friendly face was the guys who held onto our luggage while we were changing rooms. I had to e-mail a complaint to get any sort of apology. They did waive the $25 daily service charge for one night but they seemed to think this was enough of an apology to keep me happy. We were given the correct room the following day which again was very clean and modern and more than satisfactory but even though we were on the 14th floor and the windows were double glazed it was very noisy all night long with traffic beeping horns, bins being emptied outside and people talking loudly on the street below. Be aware UK visitors, none of the rooms have tea or coffee making facilities, just water or room service. The location of the hotel is perfect, far enough from Times Square to be away from the hustle and bustle and a five minute walk from Central Park. There is no restaurant so no breakfasts apart from a store which sells coffee and pastries, but it was nice to get out and there are lots pf places to sit down and eat nearby. Will I stay here again?

It is in a walking distance of Times Square. The room was not big but quite modern decorated. Negative however is the lack of privacy when you have a room in the back (or you face a wall). Also negative is the charge of a facility fee of $25 per day plus tax for facilities that you don't use or want. It is not optional, you have to pay. So it is a way to lower the price mentioned in the hotel sites (therefore create more traffic) but at the end you pay the full price. This kind of 'in pricing' should in my opinion not be made possible. It gives a bad taste to the hotel experience.","Toronto, Canada",25,3.0

I wanted very much to give the hotel a higher rating but for me there were two main issues (I'll note that we stayed on NY Marathon weekend which may have contributed)Issues: 1. Room was not as expected. We booked via Hotels.com and had selected a premier room on a higher level with Times Square views. New York is the city of high buildings, and the 10th floor facing a car park and side street wasn't what we had expected. It also appeared to have a much smaller bathroom than most of the other rooms on the floor (poked my nose in when they were being cleaned). This was disappointing. We were told we couldn't move because the hotel was fully booked and we were assured it was a premier room despite it looking identical to a classic room on the photos on the hotel website. We were offered a move if we brought our luggage down to reception the following day but this wasn't convenient and the hotel wouldn't pick the luggage up for us (with a pregnant wife and 3 year old son it was too much hassle to move). 2. There appeared to be a lot of elevators in the building but the bank of 4 elevators on one side only worked for floors 11 and up, and the bank of 4 elevators on the other side were actually only 2 elevators as 2 were for staff only. They also served all floors. So getting to and from the room took 15 minutes most times as the hotel was very busy and there was never space in the elevator (usually had to go up to come down). Probably more of a problem due to how busy it was but again suggested floors 1-10 were the cheaper rooms for the hotel.The were no other real issues. Hotel bed was comfy, rooms were good quality, our bathroom was surprisingly small and the air con is pretty noisy. I would probably try somewhere else next time because of these issues rather than the hotel being poor.

The iron in my room was not heating up, and was replaced with a new one (out of the box!) in less than 20 minutes. Over the years, I have made friends in the city, and they always marvel at how great the hotel is. The higher floors are a personal favourite, they seem to be the quietest. Price wise you will need to look around, as it tends to be different from site to site if booking on-line. In the end, you will be glad you spent the money. There are a million ""boutique"" hotels in New York, but I have found they never live up to the hype. Enjoy your trip.A",Canada,3,5.0

To start off, we called ahead of our stay to request a hypoallergenic room because of my Mom's severe allergies. When we arrived back to the hotel room after dinner ,on the first night, we were shocked to find that the room contained many pillows that my mom was allergic too. We quickly called housekeeping to remove these pillows and get new one's but we were rudely responded to by the head of housekeeping and the whole ordeal took over 30 minutes. A few night following the incident we returned back to our hotel room late at night to find that the housekeeper had failed to leave us clean towel . We didn't even have one clean towel to share among the four of us. It took over 45 minutes to get this issue resolved and we didn't get to sleep until pass 2 AM. The worst thing about this whole ordeal is that when we complained about the treatment we were told by one manager that these things sometimes happen and that they are not at fault. When we spoke to another manager in the morning she mentioned that she would comp us for our bad experience. But when we went to check out we didn't received any financial compensation and we were told that the manager wouldn't be coming in until 11 that day. Since we had at 11 am flight to catch so we couldn't stay around to complain. Overall this experience put an extremely sour note on our trip and I wished I hadn’t been so frugal and had cough up the extra 45 dollars to stay at my favorite New York hotel the Affinia Manhattan. Since returning home I have had several friends who are planning trip to New York and they have asked me about my experience at the Park Central Hotel. I have been honest and upfront and have encouraged them to stay away at all cost. In the end my stay at the Park Central Hotel was one of the worst experiences in my life and left a sour taste in my mouth.

I asked for a room not so near the elevators, and got changed to a great room on a corner, quiet and very comfortable. I was worried about running out of shampoo and such (courtesy of previous reviews), but large containers were installed in showers and was never an issue. The room was great, TV, etc, no complaints. The desk folks, concierge, guest service people, every one was very accomodating, and the wait time was very brief.. Lots of smiles.

However my concerns were quickly put to rest. We planned a girls trip...it was my friend and her two girls (ages 10 &12) along w/myself and my niece (age 11). Our stay at Park Central was AWESOME!!! From the first moment we checked in at the front desk w/Joe (who was fantastic) to the moment we checked out. The hotel staff was ALWAYS friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated!! I read reviews about the elevators being very slow. We never once had a problem. We checked in on a Wednesday and left on a Saturday so we experienced the hotel when it was slow to its peak time. During that duration we never waited for an elevator!!! The location of the hotel was PERFECT!! You step out of the hotel and look to your right and can see Times Square. Look to your left and you can see the trees of Central Park. You can't ask for a better location!! Though most of the main tourists attractions are w/n walking distance occasionally there is a need for a taxi.The guys in the front of the hotel were super about pulling over a taxi for us.

After searching online for the ""right"" hotel we were very pleased that we chose to stay at this hotel.LOCATION:If there was ONE good reason to book this hotel it would be because of the great location! A short walk from Central Park, a 10-min walk to Times Square, a subway station right next to the hotel and so many shops and restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel. (Do check out Hell's Kitchen in 9th Avenue!)HOTEL:I have read reviews where people complain about slow lifts, well we were on the 18th floor and we never once had an issue. We did not have to wait long for a lift and the lift moved swiftly. The hotel lobby was lovely, quite a buzz with lots of people milling around. Friendly staff, check-in and out was easy and quick. The new décor is great.ROOM:We booked the Premier King room (1810) - we were happy with the room and the king size bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on!! The bathroom was a tad small but how often were we in the bathroom anyway? The important thing was that it was clean, the water was hot and the white towels were fresh and fluffy. Our white linen was changed every day. Huge flat screen television. The room was airy and light with a nice view from our window onto the surrounding buildings and 7th Avenue below us to the left.I asked the hotel if we could have a small fridge in our room as we were staying for 10 nights, this was such a help. I bought my own little travel kettle, coffee cups & tea bags along with us so I was able to store milk, water, juice, fruit, cheese and muffins in our little bar fridge. The hotel does not have a restaurant (only a little ""grab-and-go"" in the lobby) but the hotel is surrounded by numerous shops and restaurants. There is a Whole Foods at Columbus Circle but we found a closer food store open 24/7 located in 56th street (2 streets up) between 7th and 6th Avenue called 'Morton Williams Fresh Food Market'. Another favourite was the 'Fresh& Co' on the corner of 7th Ave and 56th Street - the coconut Thai curry chicken salad $6, and the rice pudding $3.50 was my favourite...!!FIRST TIME VISITOR TO NYC TIP:One thing we learnt eating out was that ""The price you see is not the price you pay"". In restaurants and bars the waitress will add the NY sales tax (I still don't know how much that is?) and a tip usually between 15 - 20%, to the total amount, so be prepared for that when eating out.The $32 weekly subway ticket is worth it if you stay in the hotel for a week or more and plan to travel all over the place.To sum up, we enjoyed staying at the Park Central. We were blessed with amazing hot and humid weather during our stay at the end of July so we spent a lot of time in Central Park.Would I recommend this hotel....

The hotel's location is A+. It is just south of central park south and Lincoln Centre and right across the street from Carnegie Hall.

Another great thing about the location is that you are 5 minutes from Times Square but removed enough not to have to deal with the chaotic nature of the ""hustle and bustle"".The room was clean and the maid service was really good. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the check-in/check-out was fast and efficient.The only complaint we had was that the elevator service can be slow at times. The hotel has a time share section next to the regular hotel section and the 4 elevators are divided 2/2 between the regular hotel and the time share section. Unfortunately, there are times when you have to wait for an elevator as they are small and are full to capacity on the way down. The best thing is to try and avoid going down to the lobby at check-out time if you're not actually checking out, which is 12 noon. The Wi-Fi access is an extra charge automatically added to your room charge but it was excellent and came in handy.

The staff were friendly, efficient, and the bellmen were wonderful. The location is one of its greatest features, halfway between Central Park and Times Square, you really do feel like you're in the heart of NYC. It's not the best hotel for business travelers, but for tourists it's hard to think of a better place....until you get to the ridiculous ""facility"" fees. $27/night tacked on to your rate for a set of useless amenities. Here's what they say you get for $27/night:-In-room wifi-Local and long-distance phone calls-Complimentary bag storage-Access to fitness centerIn-room wifi is a completely reasonable thing to charge for, although I'll point out that there are plenty of other hotels that do not charge for in-room wifi any longer. Where the fee gets ridiculous is the phone and luggage storage. Find me one person who travels to NYC without a cell phone. It's a useless benefit and it's insulting to customers that you charge them for something that provides literally no value to them. Luggage storage? Most other hotels charge $1/bag. Give me a break. Fitness facilities I get, but for that amount of money you better have the best gym available, which you do not.The GM has made plenty of comments on TripAdvisor reviews saying that ""we go to great lengths to make our required facility fee transparent to our guests"". Mr. Fraser, because you're transparent about your ""facility fee"" does not mean it's not insulting to your customers. The cheaply photocopied signs at the check-in desks that basically say ""I told you so"" in a variety of languages degrade your otherwise beautiful lobby. That you need signage telling your customers that they agreed to the fee means you've had enough unhappy customers to necessitate a sign.If I sent you an invoice for $27/night for the privilege of having me stay at your hotel, you'd refuse to pay, because in your opinion you probably didn't receive $27 worth of value from me staying at your hotel, right? Well guess what, no guest receives $27/night value from your ridiculous fee. When I brought this up to the check-in attendant, she mentioned that everyone else in the area charges fees as well. Guess what? If I liked everyone else's pricing model so much I would've stayed at the other places! Be brave enough to set a standard that other hotels want to meet, instead of determining your pricing model by what you can get away with.Show that you care about your customers by building in the facility fee into your nightly rate. If you charge it to every customer it should not be a separate line-item. And it should DEFINITELY not be taxable, as we are receiving no product.Looking forward to your response, Mr. Fraser.","University Park, Texas",18,1.0

We loved the location-walkable to Times Square, 5th Avenue and on the bus tour line. First of all, the check-in line was long and there were only two people working to check people in at 3:00 on Friday afternoon, as well as to answer questions from people already staying at the hotel. The concierge appeared to be on the phone for the entire time we were checking in and was not available to help people, so they had to ask the desk staff. Our room was a corner room with lots of light and a nice neighborhood view, but we wondered if it had been cleaned prior to out arrival. The beds were made, but there were no towels or bathmat. There was also no coffee maker in the room, which was fine, but would have been nice. We called for towels and waited, but none came. We went out for several hours and there were still no towels when we came back. We called again and some were delivered in about an hour, but no bathmat. We had to call again the next day for that. The next day, we went out for the entire day and the room had not been cleaned when we got back around 4:00. Called again to ask about this and were told that housekeeping was still working and would get to us next. We said that were there now and getting ready to go out for dinner, so they said they would come in about 90 minutes. 20 minutes later, in the middle of getting ready, they came but we were not in a position to let them in. When we came back several hours later, they were in the process of cleaning our room-at 9:00 p.m. The next two nights of our stay were fine and the room was cleaned on a more regular hotel schedule, toiletries and towels were replenished. In addition, there was a very long wait for the elevators, especially at check out time. It is also deceiving that our reservation included ""free"" wifi, but all rooms are charged a $25 fee PER NIGHT for the use of wifi and gym. This was stated when we book our reservation, but the room we chose specifically said free wifi, where others did not, so it was confusing.

There is an ice machine in the hall, so if you bring a cooler you can keep things chilled that way, but I do not know how you'd reheat anything. The bathroom was also very nice, with a fairly good size tub. The only other deficiency is the elevator. There is only one pair of elevators that serve a given set of floors (ie floors 3-8) and we would often have to wait 5 minutes or so before we could get the elevator to stop for us.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to first time visitors to the Big Apple.

An attempt to explain the arrangement just got more and more ridiculous, I think the hotel could invest in a lifting bar seriously. Lastly, there is this additional (compulsory) service charge of $25 per day on arrival that is apparently for access to the gym & wifi.

Other hotels take your cell number and call you as soon as your room is ready. Once we got our room, we discovered someone had smoked in it. We were told they would send someone up to sanitize the smell. It never happened the entire weekend. Our second day we were gone all day, came back at 6pm and the room had not been cleaned! There was trash on the lobby floor, trash in the room floor halls and the bathrooms have toothpaste splattered all over the wallpaper around the sink area.

We called to complain and were assured it would be addressed. The next morning at 7:30 a.m. the smoke was still filling the hallway and our room. We had to place a towel at the bottom of our door because our kids were getting high watching cartoons!We called the desk again. We invited the manager to come up to our room to see that we were not exaggerating and that whatever was supposed to be done the night before had not been done or was not enough to stop the problem. She was apologetic but the damage was done to our experience. In our pjs we packed up and went to the lobby.

Check in was a breeze and nothing was a problem and being crazy Xmas week staff were very helpful. Didn't eat there so I am not able to comment on that but there is a small store that stocks basics for you to purchase. There are plenty of Walgreens or CVS stores around for supplies. On NYE I had booked a different room for the night which had a view straight down to Times Square to watch the ball drop, so after spending sometime with thousands of people we could enjoy the warmth and view from our room. We did have to check out of our 1st room but the hotel kept our bags for us and then we spent the day out and come back and we could check into the new room early. Security around the hotel was tight NYE and you had to show your room key when entering the hotel which was comforting to know. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location and value for money.",,16,5.0

We couldn't have chosen a better base for ourselves to explore the craziest of the city.

Bad: Noisy: the building is very old so the window is not good at separating the noise. I lived on the 14th floor but I felt like I slept on the street. I end up asking the hotel for ear plug.Amentities: The room is quite small but I think it is reasonable as it is in the most centre area of Manhattan but the room does not come with a fridge and coffee maker. Service: From the very start of our checking, as we stayed at the hotel for four night and we have our own vehicle so I chose the package with the $10 valet parking. the first night we arrive, there is nobody at the front to take the car, as I have to enter into the hotel to find somebody to take our car and no body come to help us with our luggage, the front desk lady have absolute no smile when checked us in. New York really does not need a car so we only took the car once to send my friend back home and this is the only one time that I bring my vehicle out and the process is very troublesome. We have to line up at the front desk to get a stamp on the valet ticket before they call anybody to get our vehicle. they don't have a separate spot for valet parking. After they call, I was told to wait up to 30 minutes to get my vehicle. After around 30 minutes I go outside and I saw my car so I give the ticket to the guy and ask for my car key, then he tell me he don't know about where the car key is, then he ask to ask the front desk, the front desk lady was talking happily with her worker and when I approach her, she ask me what I want? I say I want my car key, she gives me a horrible look and ask me back saying why not ask the people at the outside? I said they told me to come in. Then she left to find somebody and another guy come and told me the guy who have my car key is elsewhere doing something else and we have to wait till he come back. It took us around 45 minutes to get our vehicle and I am glad I only did that once. Deco: the hotel use a very weird sense of decoration in the hotel in my opinion only. Instead of making the hotel feel cozy, they chose to out a scary looking face painting in our washroom. The picture really made me uncomfortable so I called the housekeeper in the morning to take the picture off the wall and they very nicely said they will do it. But at the end of the day, the picture is still there. so I called again and when they come, they told me the picture is locked and only the daytime super intendant have the key. Then I complaint to them saying I called in the morning so it is not my fault if you guys does not have the key to remove the paint. They just told me the paint could not be removed anyway. If so, why not tell me at the beginning? In conclusion, the price of hotel might look decent in the city center of New York and the hotel is supposed to be four star, that's why I chose the hotel. But the truth is, it is not worth the money if you are thinking this is a four star hotel because after I lived at there, I know this is not a four star hotel. And I will not go back again.",,5,1.0

The lobby is gorgeous. We were met by two men who directed us to the front desk where at least three ladies were working diligently with the customers checking in. This was a very busy Friday afternoon, however we had no wait time.We checked in, headed to our room and were met with a huge comfy bed (that we hated to get out of), a large tv, comfy chair all very clean and fresh. The bathroom was spotless and everything was nicely arranged. For those before us who complained the fan did not work in the bath, there are two wall switches. One for the wonderful bright light in the shower/tub area and one for the vanity.We had an inside room, not facing the street, but were never bothered by any noise and never had to wait for an elevator.The internet was the only challenge we had, but we soon discovered it took patience and perseverance to get our Amazon Fire TV Stick working.There is a lovely place for snacks in the lobby and a few steps from the front door are Starbucks, Premier Deli and a Subway Sandwich shop,along with other restaurants.Our completed bill was placed gently under the door for check out, leaving us to only gather our luggage and catch a cab.The maid service did knock gently on our door to check to see if we needed service, however they always announced very prominently ""Housekeeping"" and were completely polite when we stated we only needed more towels.

I am giving one star because of several reasons but one being the staff was not helpful and welcoming as I thought they would be. I called the afternoon prior to my check-in about parking and the woman on the phone (wish I asked her name) had misinformed me about how much valet parking was. This was an issue for me because I was arriving around 1 am from the airport (tired) and if I had known earlier valet parking was $60, I would have done my research ahead of time for a better priced parking garage instead of driving around in circles for parking. I explained my frustration with reception about their staff giving out wrong information and their response was that they have guest response services through the phone in Vegas and they must have given out wrong information and apologized.I figured I would just let the parking situation go until I learned that the hotel charges $25 per day for facilities fees(wifi, gym, storage) from my friend who checked in our room before me. The receptionist explained that the charges was listed when I made the reservation on orbitz but of course it was listed on the side very small so I did not see this. All I saw was that we were going to receive free wifi which obviously I learned later that it's not free! I explained that I haven't been to a hotel that doesn't just add that fee to the reservation price or allow the guest to pay it separately if they wanted to use these services. The receptionist explained to me that a lot of hotels around do this now and that was that. Beware of these fees when comparing prices for hotel! Obviously, I did not get the better deal that I thought I did! Also, my friend explained to me because his name was not listed on the reservation that the woman who checked him in was rude to him and gave him a hard time.

I don't so it really threw me -- sometimes almost literally. It probably has some sort of locking mechanism somewhere to prevent it from tilting. I couldn't find it.The wifi internet access was very inconsistent, mostly slow, and the signal strength was not always very strong. Hallway noise was pronounced and my room apparently was next to the elevator shafts because I heard a muffled quiet rumble all the time, but it was on the wall opposite the bed so it was tolerable.One thing that I knew about but didn't think I would miss so much is that they do not have a restaurant or room service. The bar is nice, but the space could use at least some tapas. Even the HGI I stayed at in Times Square area a few years ago had room service.","Lafayette, Indiana",10,3.0

The zoo is a main attraction but there are plenty of other attractions. For example, there is a castle, an Alice in Wonderland statue, a playground with rides.....

RESTAURANT, bla, bla bla, no restaurant.

The room size is at least 500 sq ft, and the location of the hotel was central to Central Park, and most of the theatre related venues that one would like to visit as a tourist, including Carnegie Hall, which is across the street. The hotel when we visited in February 2015 was newly renovated, but the more disappointing aspect of the hotel is the lack of pool, sauna, or anything of that sort. The bar in the lobby was just opening up from the renovations, and therefore, most of the details of the room was new. The downside of staying within this area is the amount of tourists within the building, but considering how many keys the hotel has, the elevator access was very limiting during our stay. The other disappointment was that with this hotel, you can't expect the Starwood treatment, as they did not even have slippers to offer. Generally speaking, if one would like to access Central park and the sorts, including shopping at Time Warner, the location is great; however, if you're more into the downtown scene, that I am generally more inclined to, this location is still just steps away from the subway.

I will start with the positives. The hotel is so close to so many wonderful New York City sites, especially Central Park, Columbus Circle and just a host of Restaurants and the Theatre District. I also had a wonderful gentleman who checked me in and he made me feel extremely welcomed. I had a Premier King room which was a decent size with an average side view. Now the negatives.. Waiting for check-in was long and tedious, before I actually was seen by the wonderful gentleman that I just spoke about. It was 4 pm and the line was extremely long because there was just one person checking people in. I'm not sure if there was a malfunction with the computers but there seemed to be at least 5 other people staring and hitting buttons on the computer, but no one was assisting the one gentleman checking everyone in. The next negative was that there were (no exaggeration) at least 200 teenagers, screaming and running in, out and around the hotel lobby. While they were doing this, a staff member from the hotel decided to compete with the noise by yelling and clapping his hands telling the teenagers that they couldn't run in the lobby. The noise level was unnerving and along with the wait for check-in....Yuck!!! I did ask at check-in if I could get a room far away from the screaming 200 teenagers, which was happily granted to me by the wonderful gentleman that I keep referencing. I finally headed up to my room in what are very small elevators. Upon entering the room, there was an unusual and unpleasant smell to it; like mildew. I walked into the bathroom and the smell was disgusting and overwhelming. The shower curtain reeked of mildew and pure sourness. Normally, I would have asked to have a change of room or at least a change in the shower curtain, but I didn't have time to spare because I lost so much of my preparation time waiting to be checked in. I needed to get ready for the evening and not wait to see if another room was available or if someone could come and change the nasty smelling shower curtain. Additionally, the chair and ottoman that were in the room were filthy with stains on them. The whole room was just horrible and I made sure to spend as much time out of it as possible. My cell phone, AT & T service did not work in the hotel so I had to keep going outside to make phone calls, receive phone calls and make and receive texts. This was annoying and inconvenient. Lastly, I was awakened by the noise of someone slipping my bill under my door at 2:00 in the morning; really paper shouldn't make that much noise. For what I paid, I would have expected a much better room and experience. I will not stay here again.","Hoboken, New Jersey",1,2.0

At one point there was at least a hundred school kids running through corridors and crowding the few lifts that service the building. I often had to wait for four different lifts to arrive before I could squeeze in. Then, there was the room... A corporate-looking square (although quite spacious for NY) in prison block-colours of grey, grey and... grey. I had to change room after the first bathroom offered a toilet that refused to flush and an empty tissue box, as well as remnants from the previous occupants all over the floor and a television that refused to switch on.The toiletries were pitiful, and bad quality.The bedding was thin and not in the slightest bit comfortable. Upon complaining about these issues as well as the lack of wifi access, I was spoken to quite condescendingly by the manager who still insisted that I had to pay an absurd 'facilities' fee that covers wifi (which should be free), the gym (also should be free) and luggage storage (most DEFINITELY should be free). At an extra $28 per night, this certainly adds to the end bill, especially when you don't use ANY of these so-called 'extra facilities'. I moved room to one that was smaller and equally depressing, but was assured that it was better due to the higher floor. When the view outside your window is the same whether you're on the second or 10th floor, I don't really think it matters? The housekeeping staff obviously don't pay attention to their role, and on one occasion I found two of my items within the bed after being made! On another occasion, I requested housekeeping in the afternoon, and by the time i returned at 7pm, nobody had been to service the room. Upon calling again, I asked them to send someone after 8pm when I would be out of the room, but lo and behold, someone walked in on me whilst I was in a bath towel ten minutes later without even a knock. Mornings promised the beautiful sounds of staff yelling down corridors to one another.The floor staff were usually scowling, nobody offered to help with guests struggling with bags, and unfortunately they still expect a tip and a great review at the end of it. This hotel ruined my stay in NY and I most certainly will not be staying here again or recommending to friends.","London, United Kingdom",12,1.0

We arrived after 4 pm on a Friday afternoon and were able to check-in immediately, there was no line, etc.The Hotel: The hotel is located in Midtown West, steps from Central Park and Times Square. Hotel highlights included a beautifully renovated lobby and cocktail lounge. We stayed in a Classic room with two double beds, which was also updated. Room highlights included comfortable beds, a safe and a large flat-screen TV. The bathroom had a rainshower and offered C.O. Bigelow products. Room negatives were that the bed sheets seemed somewhat thin? Also, while the rainshower worked great, the second showerhead was not installed and was actually left on our bathroom counter? (I personally would not put guests in a room until any needed maintenance is complete. However, we did not complain about the second showerhead as it was a minor issue.) Miscellaneous: The hotel charges a mandatory “facilities” fee of $27.21 ($25 plus tax) per night. The fee includes Wi-Fi, use of the fitness center and luggage storage. The hotel did not have a traditional restaurant or room service but offered a “grab-and-go” market. (This was not an issue for us as there are so many great restaurants in New York City.) Our room was fairly quiet but we did hear a little noise at night from our neighbors and other guests in the hallway. We had no issues with the elevators except the morning we checked out, it was quite busy at that time and it took a few tries before we were able to “squeeze” into an elevator, etc.Overall: We had a good stay at this hotel, it was clean and the location was excellent.

The Hotel was in a perfect location; 2 minutes from Central Park and 2 minutes from Times Square; only had breakfast in house once which was adequate but more for business travellers or those who prefer not to talk!

A couple of days before we arrived, I received an email asking if I wanted to upgrade our room to 2 beds for $40 per night (which is what I thought I had booked anyway). So I emailed the Hotel to remind them there were 3 of us and may struggle with 1 bed so she upgraded us to a 2 bed room free. When we checked in, we thankfully had been given a 2 bed room which was large, airy and clean. I found the staff at the desk to be a little abrupt that could be mistaken for being rude, however there would always be a friendly message on my phone afterwards asking if the service was ok so I put it down to just the way it is and I am sure it is not meant the way it is taken. The hotel is 10 minutes away from Central Park and Times Square and there is a subway round the corner so it is in a fantastic location. There are lots of shops and food outlets close by so it is handy for everything. I would recommend this hotel although it can be pricey and would stay here again.","Blackpool, United Kingdom",142,4.0

The main drawback was the lack of light anywhere in the room. A lot of times a hotel will try to reduce energy exposure (and expenses) by lowering wattage in the room, asking you to reuse towels, etc but at least give you decent light in the bathroom. My daughter and I had to literally use our phone lights to look for clothes in the dresser drawers, apply makeup in the bathroom, etc. It was laughable after awhile.The air conditioner was set to the lowest setting but was tolerable at best. Our second night our sheets and pillows actually felt damp from the humidity in the room.While the staff was very nice and efficient and housekeeping was very friendly, I don't think I would put myself through this experience again.","Richmond, VA",14,3.0

Instead, they rock diagonal from the front left to the back right. I checked another room and the chair did the same thing. I then went to another floor and the chair did the exact same thing. Either the person who put them together put every single hotel room chair together wrong or they purchased them from a horrible vendor. This was painfully annoying.Second, I booked this hotel through Hotwire, but when I arrived, they told me that I would have a MANDATORY extra $25 a night fee for WIFI and the fitness room. If fees would be mandatory, they should be included in the Hotwire price and not have someone be given a surprise fee when I arrived.Third, NO late checkout. I asked for late checkout (maybe one hour), but was told that they do not offer late checkout. Now, this is not a requirement, but it's nice when hotels will give this. When it is not given, I think that TripAdvisor readers should know that they will not get late checkout at this hotel.Staying at this hotel was not a disaster, but for the three reasons listed above (especially the horrible defective chairs in every room), I cannot recommend this hotel. Very sad, because I stayed here 16 years ago and loved it. I was so excited to come back, but left disappointed.","Annandale, Virginia",13,2.0

The hotel is busy and bustling which doesn't bode well when there are only 2 lifts servicing the enitre place! Very busy queues indeed :( Rooms are large, and cleaned thoroughly every day by very lovely staff - much nicer than check in ladies who seem to just want to put you in a queue even when you're asking a question!! I can't fault the rooms - we only changed and slept in them so they were perfect for our every day needs. They were quiet too, despite being near the front entrance.The hotel bar isn't open during the day and shuts promplty by 12 everyevening but that's ok as there are many, many good bars just around the corner. In fact, everything is just around this hotel so the location is just great. It's a short walk to pretty much everything and if you need a cab the very helpful men outside will get one - we ordered one the morning of departure; an SUV to JFK which was much cheaper than the 'flat rate' yellow cabs.There's the 'resort fee', 'local tax' and various other types of tax on the bill that I didn't really get, but do check this as it does bump up the overall bill!I would recommend this hotel as it's modern, large, busy, clean, well priced, and best of all VERY CLOSE to everything!

Be warned - the room rate is $25 higher than advertised due to the ""Facilities Fee"", which ""includes"" wifi, use of the fitness center, and phone calls from the room (the second and third of which seem absurd - I've NEVER been charged to use a fitness center - and who the hell still uses a hotel phone to make calls?!) They don't hide the fee or anything - but the justification is lame and the room rate is deceiving since this is not an optional add on.As for my experience specifically - it was pretty mixed - and this is what gets it a three: After checking in I went to my room to find two things I wasn't thrilled with. First, there was a used razor blade (from a men's razor"") in plain sight on the carpet (see photo). Not something that would have/should have been easily missed while cleaning. Whatever - I could overlook that. Second, one of the bedside lamps was not only without a shade, but had been seriously damaged (see photo). The lamps were glass and this one was half missing with sharp and jagged parts remaining. If I hadn't noticed it (not sure how that would have happened) and rolled over in the dark to turn on the light, it was definitely in a condition to slice a digit off. Anyway, I called the front desk and asked them to change the lamp out while I went to dinner. Came back - no change. Called again and they sent up the housekeeping manager - who seemed to be (justifiably) appalled. I asked if they could just switch my room and they did - to a very nice two-room suite. So - that was a plus. Even still, the new room had a lamp issue (weird theme) inasmuch as one of the outlets had a cord prong still sticking out of it (see photo). And the sofa in the living room had a gross stain (see photo - doesn't quite do it justice). I'm pretty forgiving - and didn't bother griping about these things - but it just seems like a lack of attention to detail in the housekeeping/maintenance dept. I travel 100+ days a year and - overall - this is a totally decent place. What would have made it better, would have been if I didn't have to make the calls/ask for changes in the first place.","Colchester, Vermont",1,3.0

While the renovations are nice and the rooms quite comfortable, the staff service is where this hotel is lacking. The older, grey-haired gentleman who checked us in seemed bothered to be there, and didn't explain a single thing about the hotel... We were left to figure it out on our own. Plenty of staff in and around the lobby yet not a single one greeted us during our stay. We certainly didn't expect to be carried to our rooms, but a simple ""hello"" would have been nice and is generally the norm in any hotel. Beware of the $27 per day resort fee - which includes the ""free wifi"" (as well as fitness centre access, U.S. calling, luggage storage, and a few other things that come standard in most hotels).Housekeeping service wasn't great. Beds seemed haphazardly made, small amenities like soap and ice bag weren't replaced during our stay. Beds are very comfortable though - some of the best sleep I have ever had in a hotel.You will receive an email after check-in asking you to email them with any issues - don't bother. Based on my experience and reading other reviews, you won't receive a response.All in all, very unimpressed by the service at the Park Central.

But this one was different. Though other staffs were very friendly and kind, the man at the front desk with gray hair was exception. It started at the very beginning of our stay, when we were checking in. As soon as I started to talk, with very annoyed face and cut into my talking and then said, ""Look into eyes when you are talking to people."" At that moment, I was almost too shocked to even ask if I heard him right. Was I there to learn how to speak or check in? It was extremely rude gesture and I must say I was very disturbed as well. He didn't stop there. When I came down to front desk on my third day of my stay to do the check in again, since I made two different reservations under different names, he completely ruined my day. When I explained my situation, he asked in what name the reservation is under. I told him that it's under my name and even spelled it out for him, since many people find it very hard to spell it correctly. Did I mention he looked very annoyed as soon as I started to talk to him? Anyway, when I told him my name several times, he said he couldn't find it. So I told him few other names that my reservation my be under, and while I was doing so, he looked very disturbed and said it would be better if I just write it down for him. Excuse me, but I wasn't even finish speaking out those names. After handing the paper to him, he said he still couldn't find it. Then he asked for confirmation mail and while I was searching for it in my inbox, he was talking to a woman in front desk and I almost freaked out when he said f-word. I didn't catch him clearly, but the word is hard to miss by nature. As far as I can remember,he was saying that he didn't know what the f is happening and he got this. I didn't even want to ask if he was referring to me. It took my quite a while to find a confirmation email, and while I was doing so, he asked if it was under the name that I've spelled it out for him from the beginning. I said yes, and while I was still looking at the phone, weaving through heaps of emails for confirmation email, he said, ""Are you listening?"". I looked up at him and I still can't erase that disgusted look on his face from my head. I answered him several times when he asked my name over and over again, and I still don't know why he thought I wasn't listening. Maybe he wasn't listening to what I've been telling him, since obviously he even missed what I spelled it out for him from the beginning. So, when he asked if I was listening, I said yes, and I even told him that he name he just called is the same one that I've told him at the very beginning. At last, he finally said he was sorry for the confusion. I would have understood him if it was late at night, after dealing with tons of tourists. But it was early in the morning. I can hardly believe I was treated like this at hotel, at front desk in specific, where they greet their customers. It was the worst service I ever had in any other place, possible in my life. I understand if he doesn't want to hear anything from non-native speakers, but if he does, he shouldn't be standing there treating customers with such attitude. I was trying to send email to the hotel directly, but I couldn't find their email so I'm writing here, since they specifically mentioned that they wanted me to share my experience here with others. Well, this is my experience I had in the hotel. I would put up with their tiny room where you can hear everything from construction noises to people walking down the hall. But I won't put up with being treated as if I had begged to stay here while I paid over $200 per night to stay here. I wanted to leave this review after I leave, but I just had to let it out. I couldn't stop thinking about it for whole day and it just ruined my day from the moment I walked out of the lobby. I must say I am curious how he treats guests who don't speak English at all. I bet he would just ignore them with disgusted face. My little piece of advice would be like this: if you're not fluent English speaker, just avoid the place. You might find it hard to believe in NYC where tourists flocks in from every places on glove, but this hotel's front desk won't make you feel welcomed if you are not.","New York City, New York",4,1.0

Possibly as good a location as one could ask for when visiting NYC. The rooms are modern and clean, as is the entire hotel. The price is reasonable considering how pricey most rooms are in NYC. The added taxes are significant but that's not the fault of the hotel. Some members of the staff stood out as exceptionally good while others less so. The doorman who hails cabs is terrific. Just the sort of personality one would like as a tourist needing a little help with transportation. The front desk at check-in and check-out times was understaffed with less than cordial people. They were no nicer even at off-peak times. The woman who fills the spot as concierge leaves a lot to be desired, too. She seems to go through the motions of doing the least she can get by with. I realize the Park Central isn't the Waldorf and you get what you pay for, but the concierge should be more accessible and friendly. If I managed the hotel she'd be looking for a job elsewhere. Then there is the problem with elevators. Although there are banks of 4, seems like only one runs at a time. On the lower floors one does better to use the stairs than wait for an elevator coming from the higher floors and by now so crowded that one needs to wait for the next car to show up only to see the same scene of people packed like sardines. It isn't just an issue on one day when there might have been a problem, it was like that all week.

The hotel went through a refit 2 years ago and is looking fresh & new. The rooms are modern with bath and shower, plenty of drawer space and hanging space. There is an iron and board in the cupboard, which is nice for refreshing cloths before you go out. My only criticisms of the room is the lag of space between bed and drawer unit (end of the bed wall), this is just wide enough for 1 person to walk through meaning a few times if there is 2 of you moving about getting ready one of you ends up walking backwards or jumping over the bed, not Ideal. The other moan is the air conditioning unit is old and noisy, and didn't seem to cool the room down enough.Check in was easy enough, and check out was automatic if you weren't querying the bill, which is popped under your door the morning of your departure. ours was fine and we just dropped the key card in the box, simple. The concierge checked out bags on the last day due to a late flight so we could do out and even arrange a black car for travel to JFK, which was only $5 more than a taxi and far more comfortable.The small in reception carries a nice supply of bakery, fruit and drinks and is open early until 10pm, the staff were friendly, and prices weren't over priced. The hotel had free wifi for all guests which was fast enough for facetiming the kids in the UK.The reservations team and I must mention Annette were lovely to deal with.

I found them interesting...and all valid.One cannot dispute the location. Excellent. But there are MANY options with the same excellent location, so that should NOT be a factor when selecting this hotel. So then what do we, as travelers look for? There were mentions of bad views, but that is up to you topaz for upgraded views which I did. I had a Premier Room with windows overlooking , well, the city across the street. But thats fine. Like other reviewers stated- no mini bar or fridge, which I find confounding. No food/room service. That is such a no brainer these days. No coffee bar in the room-even the ""lower end"" hotels have these, Park Central does not. The room was pleasant enough and the bathroom was fine. The baggage storage is a plus. BTW - the starbucks next door mentioned in a earlier review-- gone. The day after we arrived! Crazy.A previous reviewer talked about only two elevators and the long wait for them. They were RIGHT. So weird.But here was my problem. When I booked, I made a special request for NO FEATHER pillows/bedding due to my partners allergies.Then when I checked in at 4pm, I reiterated the request, just to be sure.After being out for the evening, I returned to the hotel at 11pm.....they still had not changed the pillows. I called, they said they would take care of it. We were so tired, but had to wait.midnight---no pillows. I call again. I explained the history and the situation. The fellow on the other end was VERY apologetic and was going to get it done right away.12:30 am---now, this is putting a cramp on my love life for the evening. So I'm pissed now. I decide to head downstairs to the desk. I open my door, and there in the hallway was a maid with three pillows on the floor of the hallway. She picked one up at a time and kind of ""banged"" it then put on a pillow case. OMG---really? on the dirty carpet/floor? She then asks if three are enough. I suggest to her next time, don't put them on the floor. She apologizes. I'm thinking, oh no-my toothbrush will be going right in the toilet tomorrow.Anyway- I had received an email that afternoon from the director of guest engagement, in which he stated that if I ""FACED ANY OBSTACLES during my stay"" that i should contact him or his staff.so-----I email him the next day and explain the events of the night before.

Just spent one week there in a 9th floor room overlooking 55th St and heard nothing from inside or outside the hotel. Loved the high ceilings, comfortable space and modern décor, especially taupey-grey colors. Art selection was very attractive too and the lighted picture was a nice touch. Reno must have included plumbing because the whole bathroom functioned extremely well and shone.However, as nice as this hotel is, service is not its strong suit. Although there are quite a few uniformed men at the door and in the lobby, not once was the door opened or held for me, luggage or not. Yesterday I stood under the hotel canopy for a full ten minutes while waiting for a shuttle pickup before one of the two men there asked why I was there. The outside window displays a sign offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner but no such thing was happening there this week and the beautiful bar lounge was pretty much deserted most evenings. The ""Central Market"" is tiny with very limited offerings and hours. If you want coffee or a snack after 10pm you will have to go out on the street. No vending machines or in-room coffee pots. The tap water is probably hot enough to make instant coffee or brew a cup of tea but you'd have to plan that in advance. When the market is open, expect to pay $3+ for coffee and $5+ for a can of Bud Lite. Except for the WiFi and safe, I don't know what the daily $27.21 ""resort fee"" bought me but this is NY after all.Housekeepers are friendly but their work is spotty. I don't need service every day and often refuse it but when it happens I expect changed pillowcases to be removed and the ice bucket to be emptied.

We tried multiple times and with multiple email addresses but to no avail. So we could never use the WIFI though our entire stay.

Isince we were celebrating our 25th anniversary we decided to make a night of it and stay in a hotel in Manhattan. We were seeing a Broadway show, so I wanted a convenient location that would be walking distance. After doing extensive research we decided the Park Central would fit the bill in terms of location and affordability. I read some of the negative reviews so I was a bit skeptical, but I always take those reviews with a grain of salt. I booked through a third party website and it was made very clear that there was a $25 facilities fee. Whether or not I agree with the fee is irrelevant. It was made quite clear so I am not sure why other reviewers complained that they were unaware of it until they checked in. We arrived around 5:30 pm. The check in process was quick and the desk clerk friendly. She knew it was our anniversary and she ""upgraded"" us to a premium room. Not exactly sure what the difference was between our reserved room and the premium room but that was nice of her nonetheless. Our room was small compared to other hotels we have stayed in, but it was clean and modern. Although I have stayed in many, many hotels since I live in NYC I hadn't stayed in one in Manhattan for over 13 years. I am not sure if it is just the Park Central or Manhattan hotels in general, but there were not many amenities in the room at all. Since we were only staying one night it was not a big deal to me, but if we were staying longer a coffee maker and refrigerator in the room are nice to have. The bathroom was modern and very clean, however there were no amenities there as well. The shower did have the dispenser for body wash, shampoo and conditioner but the body wash was empty. There was one small bar of soap on the counter and a small lotion but that was it. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable. I know other reviewers complained about the street noise and yes, you will hears cars, busses, sirens etc. but hey it is Manhattan after all so that didn't bother me as I hear that at home as well.

After reading some of the reviews we did come prepared with a small travel kettle and some coffee. However I do think in this day and age these things really are a basic human need and really in a hotel of the stature it promotes really should provide a mini fridge too. Although much of what others have written is true we did not really experience much delays on the lifts, reception was good, lounge area we only used when waiting to leave but it was most comfortable. I think the lack of a restaurant is really bad though, when you are out sight seeing all day it would be really nice to come back and have room service or a nice coffee late in the evening at the bar or have a meal in the hotel instead of having to trudge the streets for something suitable rather than just burger bars. There are eateries around but they are fast food or coffee and muffins. Our room was like a UK premier inn good size with 2 queen beds with a view over the front door from 16th floor which was about as good as it gets here. The room was quiet all night and the beds were really comfy. The room was fairly clean but could have done with a bit more dusting. I think the house keepers have a lot to do in a day and have to rush some of the bits. We came back about 4 pm one afternoon and our room had not yet been touched and had to phone to get clean towels and the housekeeping lady then came and did our room after I asked her to as she was in the corridor. The in room movies was a good selection although had to phone to get it to work - also the bath plug didn't work had to phone for that to be fixed. All of which was done and reception did phone on all occasions to ensure I was happy. It is well placed for everything to see and central park is lovely. All in all we did our research and came prepared it would just be nice if kettle and fridge was supplied and an onsite restaurant would make this hotel great.

It may have recently been refurbished but don't let the fresh look and swanky lobby fool you!!!The negatives;there are only two lifts and they are very slow so it takes ages to get to and from the room.Our room was dirty the bath had hair and grime in it and there was a dried up dirty flannel under the sink. The shower curtain barely fits over the bath edge, the shower is very slow to drain, you can't take the shower head of the wall. There are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room. Came in last night from a the cold. Just wanted a hot drink to warm up. Went to bar asked for a coffee, and the waitress was polite but said she was unable to serve hot drinks. There is a market place to get snacks and hot drinks but it closes at ten.Tried tonight to get a hot drink from market place at 9.30pm there was a guy there but he told us he was shut. Again no place to get a hot drink!!! Not a four star service.We have an internal room on 6th floor it is very very noisy. The air con unit outside is humming all night and is very intrusive!!Logging into the ""free"" WiFi took ages and wasn't simple, had to spend ages on phone to desk to get sorted.Hotel charge extra for services.... including free WiFi and fitness centre. Whether you use them or not, It just feels l like a rip off. Include it in the room rate fine,but adding it as a non optional extra just feels like a con. The positives;Location is good but so is every other hotel in Manhattan.Rooms are ok sized.Asked for / extra blanket and received them quickly.Staff are ok, some better than others but didn't really feel like they cared at all.This hotel would be fine as a value three star but as a relatively pricy four star I just feel completely ripped off!!!

The location meant we could come back to the room in the middle of the day for a recharge as we had 2 children that needed to catch their breath whilst site seeing.

Had a fantastic stay this past weekend (April 16-20 2014) and could not be happier. I have stayed here many times over the years, weather for business or pleasure, and I will continue to do so. First, there is the location. You could not ask for a better spot in the city. Close to everything you need/want on a trip to NYC. All in walking distance. Second, cleanliness. The rooms (and the hotel itself) are very VERY clean, with big comfortable rooms and fantastic beds! Always a great sleep after a long day out in the city. The bathrooms are also very large, super clean and have perfect lighting. Part of enjoying any trip is knowing you are in a clean, safe and relaxing environment. Third, there is the staff. Really one of the nicest group of people you could ever meet. Always a smile, an offer to help, or a solution to a problem (that rarely comes up) I have friends who live in NYC who ask if they can stay with me to just to enjoy the room and the atmosphere at the hotel. The lobby smells like a garden-they should bottle it, and even though it's a busy hotel, it never seems ""frantic"" or disorderly. I have come to think of this hotel as my ""home away from home""!

I'm happy to report that the Park Central not only met but far exceeded my expectations. First off, the location is ideal - walking distance to most everything we wanted to see. For those sights requiring transport, the subway was just steps away. The hotel smells divine - very welcoming coming off of the street. Front desk staff was pleasant and accommodating. We arrived on a red eye and although our room wasn't quite ready, they checked our bags, offered us directions/map. I had anticipated this and we spent a few hours having breakfast and visiting a museum before returning to the hotel around 2pm, where they handed us our keys. Bellman service was speedy when we went to retrieve our bags. We were on the 6th floor, facing an interior courtyard overlooking the HVAC. Not an ideal view, but we didn't care and enjoyed having no street noise. Room wasn't huge but was more generously sized than most NYC rooms. Bathroom was small but, again not outside of the range of normal. We had 2 doubles (2 adults, 1 child) and there was plenty of room.The resort fee was clearly explained to us upon arrival (and was referenced when we booked), so we had no issue with the charge. Wifi was easy to connect (we had 4 devices connected) and was speedy enough to even allow my daughter to stream Netflix without issue.No coffee maker in the room but there are about 5 coffee shops within steps of the hotel. Not a big deal to run out and grab something. There was a cafe/quick serve place in the lobby - we picked up water there but didn't try any food. Didn't try the bar either.Upon checkout, the bellman got us a car to JFK immediately, despite it pouring rain.I would most definitely stay here again.","Las Vegas, Nevada",0,5.0

It IS in a great location, but so are a lot of hotels in the city. We liked our room. A lot. The décor was relatively modern, but not too modern and although I wouldn’t call it a “luxury” hotel, it was a “very nice” hotel. We were pleased to find that our room (which was probably a handicap accessible room) was large with a comfortable bed and lots of spare space. The room had 2 huge windows where the folks across the way could obviously see in (since we could see them). So if this bothers you, you might want to ask for a room that faces the street. The bathroom was also a good size with a lot of (what appeared to be handicap) bars on the wall. We didn’t mind them. The one knock on the room was that it didn’t have a separate shower and tub and yes, I realize that most of the rooms in NYC are built this way.Other than house cleaning who knocked on our door at least twice each morning, the staff all seemed reasonably happy and helpful. And as my husband pointed out as we were leaving that had we put the “Privacy Please” sign out, we would have saved the poor woman a little aggravation. (Sorry about that.) The only place we ate at in the hotel was to grab quick breakfasts in the morning at the little store in the lobby which had delicious pastries and coffee. In addition to Carnegie Deli being right next door, there were lots of restaurants in easy walking distance so that is what we did in the evening.The location is very good to great if your purpose for being in the city is to attend shows. Times Square, Broadway and Radio City Hall were all about a 10 minute walk. There were also a few subway stations very close with the closest being less than a block away.Overall, we enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again.","Estero, FL",67,4.0

There is a nice bar/lounge area behind the front desk, but they do not serve any food. Not even peanuts. The small coffee shop/food stand in the lobby is only open 6:30 - 22:30, so if you are having a late night drink there's no food to go with it.

Checkout time is noon, an hour later than most. Surprisingly, no on site restaurant, but many comfy chairs for lounging in behind the main desk. There are so many places to eat nearby that it's not a big deal. My only quibble is that I was charged $25.00 for ""incidentals"" - wifi and I don't know what else.

Finally the bar they close at 11:30 on weekends, they should extend to midnight. Each night I was there they were sending guests home.

I was there for 2 nights over Easter Weekend with my Daughters. I paid up for the Corner room with 2 Queen Beds. Supposedly their larger of the standard hotel rooms. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable. The furniture was modern and sparse. As a whole the room wasn't very large. Rooms as a whole in NY aren't very large. The Bathroom was very skinny. In fact when you open the door you have to be careful. It will hit the Toilet. They put door stops on the hinges. It got the Job done. There were 3 of us and 3 towels. I got the impression keeping cost down in general was a theme in the Hotel. I didn't request more. I am sure they would have provided them. Overall pretty clean and somewhat remodeled. They did a nice job on the lobby. The worst part of the hotel is the elevators. I stayed no the 17th floor. There were only 2 elevators. They are small and always packed. I had to send my family down 1 at a time with our luggage. I let 2 go by full and it took 3 more before the 3 of us made it down with our bags. Unfortunately the elevator issue was there every time we used it. Up or down. The very best part of this hotel is its location. 56th and 7th. Broadway, Central Park, shopping..You name it and you are close. You aren't paying the price of the big boys (not cheap, but not expensive). We averaged 400 a night. Be aware they will tack on a 25 dollar insult charge or facilities charge per night. I would rather see that in the price of the room. Overall, I would probably stay there again, because of the location. I give it 3 star rating. If the deal with the Elevator issues, I would give more.

The other people in our group all said the same thing. You definitely need to add more light.- way too much fragrance in the lobby (some people are allergic to these scents and having it constantly pumping into the lobby is unnecessary if not offensive)- there is no towel rack in the bathroom; also, get with the rest of the world and do not replace towels every day.

The concierge and desk personnel were also helpful and courteous. A Mr. Quinby was very helpful in straightening out a problem we had with housekeeping (more on this below). Finally, the location was excellent.The cons (and the reasons why, on balance, I doubt we’ll stay here again): A minor irritant was the lack of a coffee maker and microwave. I’ve stayed at number of hotels, both cheap and expensive. The Park Central was the first that did not provide a small coffee maker and microwave for the convenience of guests. There was also no refrigerator. These three items would have gone a long way to making our stay more convenient and, considering the rate the Park Central charges, patrons have every right to expect them.A greater nuisance, however, were the problems with housekeeping. On the second day of our stay, the person cleaning the room threw out our daughter’s retainer. It will be expensive to replace. On two evenings, we came home exhausted after miles of walking the museums and streets of Manhattan to a room that had not been given even a superficial sprucing-up: garbage pails were unemptied, beds unmade, and the same damp towels and face cloths were in a pile where we had left them for the attendant. The first time it happened, it took housekeeping two hours to send someone to do the job, which they did only after Mr. Quinby took the matter in his own hands. By the time the woman arrived, however, my exasperated wife had already made the beds: we settled for new towels and plastic cups. To his credit, Mr. Quinby reduced our facility fee by about half in compensation. When the same thing happened the following day, housekeeping sent someone to clean the room within ten minutes after my call. It is worth noting that in neither case had I left the “Do not disturb” sign on the door: there was no reason why the room should not have been cleaned.My theory is that the hotel does not have enough people on their housecleaning staff. As a result, they are overstretched and if they can’t get to a room on their schedule (on one day, a woman looked in our room at 9:00 am to see if we had vacated) then they may not get to it at all. Whatever the reason, however, the hotel needs to address this basic expectation of its patrons.","Columbus, Georgia",10,3.0

No big deal, but being in the industry for over 10 years, I was surprised, since they are rated 4 star+ ( basic courtesy should be included here).Once I arrived late at night after a long day, I requested for my room key to a front desk staff again, not one hello, or a "" enjoy your stay"". When I got to the room I was surprised by a strange smell, coming from the bathroom, I went to check to find out there was a urine stain in the shower curtain, yes, urine stain - meaning they used products to ""clean""but did not wash the curtain before the next guest went in...I was exhausted, so I was dreading calling the desk to inform them about this. But I then made up my mind to call them because I was trying to use the Internet wifi and it wouldn't work.I called the operator, and after being on hold 3 times by the front desk I said please, I would like to speak to a manager, I then got through to a front desk person who said lines like: I'm sorry but we have no rooms available for you to change to at this moment"" and there must be something wrong with your cell phone ( about the wifi) ""nobody else is having issues with the wifi"".After all the nonsense from the front desk, and being tired, I literally gave up. One hour later ( 23:30) I get a call from a lady called Elizabeth, she was kind enough to say that, they indeed have a room I could change to, and was surprisingly helpful, but too late, I was exhausted, upset and really just wanted to wake up and leave the next day.The next morning as I dropped the key, I was greeted by a Guest relations personnel, and as I left she asked if I had enjoyed my stay, and I briefly told her what happened, again, she didn't show that much concern, and convinced me to write this review.There are many other hotels in similar category that deserve my stay.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",3,2.0

Arnold Rothstein, the gambler who fixed the 1919 World Series, was killed here in 1928, and mob boss Albert Anastasia was gunned down here in 1957. Things have become quieter since then, and no trace of the hotel's violent past is evident. We had a tastefully decorated but small room with good-quality plumbing and fixtures, plenty of towels, comfortable bed and very helpful staff from the curb to the cleaning staff. Convenient to Broadway shows, good restaurants of all sorts, Carnegie Hall and the gateway to Central Park.But the view from our 7th floor room over looking the HVAC system was of perpetual night. No matter the time of day, the sunlight never peeked over the rim of the top of this huge hotel into the canyon below. The view from our window looked at two other walls of the hotel canyon with similar guest windows looking back at us through the gloom; the third wall was the blank side of the building next door. We had to keep the heavy shade on our window drawn to preserve our privacy, which only added to the darkness.The constant hum of the HVAC system at the bottom of the canyon added to our feeling of being under siege in our room. We immediately upon entering should have asked for a different room, but by the time we registered our displeasure, it was too late to vacate for the first night, and we didn't come to New York to spend time in a hotel room anyway.Also, be sure to note the fees and taxes that will be added to what you think is the room rate. Two examples: $25/night plus a tax for ""facilities charge"" for non-sleeping parts of the hotel (the exercise area, business room, etc.), and another fee for the privilege for being in the same section of town with the Javits convention center.","Chicago, Illinois, United States",80,3.0

The reason for my 2 stars. We had an incident that the staff did not handle well at all. There was a man that woke us up out of our sleep by banding on the wall repeatedly for about 15 mins. At first, I thought it was hotel maintenance. After awhile, I finally got up to see what the noise was. When I opened the door, I saw our neighbor leaving his room. I asked if he knew where the noise was coming from and he replied ""It was me. I was waking you guys up because you woke me up."" I was so confused. We had left the room the previous night (Saturday) by 10:00pm. Even if he did think my friend and I were getting dressed loudly, a knock on the door would've solved that issue. The look in his eyes were scary. He could've been capable of anything. Any-who, we complained to the front desk twice about the deranged man next door and they did nothing.

I stayed at the hotel with my sister for her extended birthday weekend. The hotel is aptly named as it is walking distance from the MoMA; minutes away from Broadway, Central Park and Times Square; and centrally located to non-chain restaurants and subways. All positives since my sister was having her first NYC/Manhattan experience. Regrettably, that was the start and end of our seemingly pleasurable experience at the hotel. We booked our room on a third party website and asked for a room on the higher floors upon arrival. We were initially given a classic king room on the 4th floor which was beyond sub-par for a hotel that has such great reviews. The room was dark, with only one window which ""boasted views"" of the rooftop ventilation systems of the neighbouring buildings and the rooms surrounding us. The bathroom was TINY for a king room - the bathroom door was haphazardly positioned - when open, it was within an inch of the of the front of the toilet. My sister and I are average height and if either of us sat on the toilet and someone opened the door, we would be just shy of a knee injury! To top things off, we were constantly disturbed by noisy occupants in the adjacent rooms (they seemed to be a travelling high school sports team who had little to no adult supervision). We immediately reported our dissatisfaction; however there were no more rooms available given our late arrival. The following day we were upgraded to a premier room on the 7th floor. The concierge was amenable and empathetic to our complaints. He advised that certain rooms were off limits since we pre-paid through a third party, but he was accommodating in light of the situation. The room had 2 windows with city views of the local shops and one with Times Square in the near distance. Our bathroom was significantly bigger, which thankfully had an unrestricted entrance that wouldn't result in injury and/or awkward maneuvers. We opted for 2 queen beds instead of a single king which offered more space. Despite these improvements, we were again disappointed. Our AC/heat was temperamental to say the least! When set to heat, it blew cold air and vice versa. We called to complain and a serviceman came up promptly. He was very polite and apologetic for the issue. After fidgeting with a few of the controls, he mentioned it ""should"" work but couldn't be certain since he had a number of calls with the same issue (not impressive since this was a newly renovated hotel at the time). We thanked him for his help, set the room at about 24C and went out for dinner and a show on Broadway. Upon our return, the room was frigid! We reported the issue to front desk; however, much to our chagrin, nothing could be done due to the late hour! We were forced to sleep in multiple layers of clothing and bury ourselves in the linens. Our only consolation were the duvets - which are more hygienic, warm and cozy than comforters or blankets.Another let down was the lack of free wi-fi. Although the hotel was equipped with a few iPads, it was insufficient for hotel's capacity. I would return to Park Central to give it another shot, as our experience may have been tainted because we booked through a third party (although one would expect the same standard of service regardless of where or how it was booked). The rooms are clean, hotel is good value for money (despite the $25/night/room wi-fi surcharge) and its centrally located to numerous landmarks and amenities. I would book directly through the hotel if its prices are comparable to its competitors and request a room on the 7th floor or higher.","Brampton, Canada",5,3.0

I visited with my wife and two young teenage children. We chose Park Central due to its great location: 3 blocks south of Central Park and 8 blocks north of Times Square, plus the fact that this hotel had queen sized double beds was a great selling point!We paid the extra premium and booked a Premier Queen Double online and were reliably informed that these rooms were on higher floors, larger than the Deluxe rooms and double aspect, so they were bright and airy. When we checked in, the female receptionist stated that a Deluxe room had been set aside. When I questioned this room, the receptionist's description quickly changed to a Premier room, Hmm. We were taken up to our room and on arrival it was plain to see that what we had been assigned was not a Premier room. After a 02:00 am start and a 9 hour flight, wouldn't it be nice to get what you asked for?we trudged downstairs and spoke with Vito. ""V-I-T-O"" said a defensive and somewhat sarcastic male receptionist. Being Italian myself, I think I could have worked that spelling out for myself.Having explained to V-I-T-O that I booked and paid for a Premier room, I expected such and were eventually given the correct room on the 18th floor.It was a shame to start the hotel experience like this but hey, that's life I guess?My only criticisms of this hotel is that there is no heating in the bathroom. No warm air heater, no heated towel rail, nothing. Which means when it's -20 outside, it's like walking into a walk-in freezer first thing in the morning! The room although light and airy during the day, is really poorly illuminated at night. There is a serious lack of storage space for clothes and suitcases considering it can take a family of four and the warm air central heating in the bedroom is noisy and gives either all or nothing. There does not seem to be any middle ground where you actually feel at a comfortable temperature. The room came with 3 bath towels, there was four of us so we asked for a fourth. The following day, we went down to 2 bath towels!When I asked another receptionist about the internet charge, I was informed that I would have to pay a package fee of $27 that included suitcase storage and gym fees. As I needed neither I didn't bother but if you log into the hotel's WiFi, you'll get all the access you'll need for a few dollars there and then. I also found that when I gratefully left our 7 bags with the hotel's suitcase storage facility whilst we waited for our limo to the airport on the last day, I was told there was no charge for the service!The lobby restrooms downstairs are unisex but then on a plus side the doorman outside is a lovely chap who was chatty and a real pleasure to exchange pleasantries with.I'm sure the Park Central Hotel would be much better in the Spring / Summer seasons. as stated, it's in a fab location, the rooms were clean, they all had a large flat-screen TV which was great watching the local NY News channel and the house keeping staff were very efficient (apart from the towels).If asked ""Would I stay here again?"" No. Not because it was bad, purely because there is so much choice out there.","London, United Kingdom",3,3.0

I was lucky enough to check in with Elisabeth from guest services. She was incredibly helpful and accommodating and went out of her way to make sure it went well for me. Maybe she saw that I was due to stay for 12 nights, but that's fine! In fact, she ended up allowing me to look at three different rooms and choose which one I wanted. This made all the difference to my stay. Whenever I needed anything, guest services were incredible - from a coffee maker, to a vase for flowers, through to checking out a drafty window - things arrived within 15 minutes. The room I got was wonderful - 18th floor and very spacious indeed. A special shout out to the fabulous maids of the Park Central, who always make my trip a pleasure and are incredibly friendly (whilst getting on very efficiently with all they have to do!) Two downsides - like others, if I ever had to go to the front desk to ask a question, staff there were bordering on the rude. On one occasion, I was told I was standing in ""the wrong place"" in order to ask a question of the staff (there was a cordoned off little area, where you had to queue) but I didn't bother standing there, as there was no one else around! I found this sort of treatment bizarre in the extreme!Secondly, the wi-fi was erratic. Given I was staying for business, I might not be able to make it a fourth trip simply on this basis, which is such a shame.","Waterloo, London",17,5.0

If we did not like our room we could call down the next day and be put in the room that we originally booked. It was late at night and I was tired from our 3 hour drive down, so I agreed that we would call down the next morning to switch rooms. We called the front desk the next morning and was transferred to 4 different people before we were finally told that no king rooms were available. I specifically said so even though I booked a king room weeks in advance you are telling me that the room I paid for is not available? She replied with yes that is correct.

My husband dropped us off outside hotel and a bellman said he would be right there to help with bags but never came back out. When we got into the lobby, there was a big line, at least ten people ahead of us. A very pleasant young man offered to get us coffee or tea while we waited, which I accepted. It might have been more beneficial if he helped check people in. Two receptionist on duty for four o'clock check in. By the time I got to check in, twenty minutes later, the line was all the way to the door. It was a very cold day out so it was quite chilly every time the door opened. I asked the receptionist why the big wait and she said the hotel wouldn't pay staff to come in even though they were full to capacity. Now that's what you call service. I had called and requested to be in a quiet room, away from elevators and ice machine and reiterated this upon check in. She said, of course, you reserved a premier room. We went up to our floor came out of the elevator and literally walked out of the elevator and there were our two rooms in front of us, right outside the elevator doors. The elevators were not even in a separate hallway. I immediately called down and, of course, reception was too busy to answer the phone so my call was sent all over the place, I finally spoke to a manager who apologized but they were full to capacity and she could not do anything for me. I was quite upset that after booking two rooms we could not be granted a simple request she then offered to waive the facilities fee which I accepted. However, next morning it was still on the bill. Obviously this hotel has a huge communication problem and non existent management. So we are off to a bad start. Our room was quite nice, good size and nice décor, my husband called it ""shades of grey"" because it was that grey and white décor but very pleasant and clean. The boys had a double room and it was a nice size also. The lounge was very nice, quite big and plenty of areas to sit and relax, also had a bar in the evening. My favorite thing about the hotel was the location, it was walking distance to central park, Columbus circle, Times square, lots of restaurants nearby. We didn't park at the hotel because 24 hour parking was $60 but if we were not back exactly within the 24 hours they charged you for another day. we parked around the block at Quik park and it was the same price and if you were not back they just charged you hourly. We got a good deal on the hotel so I was happy with the hotel, but the staff could definitely communicate a little better and lines for check in is just a bad first impression but they don't seem to care. Facilities fee is such a joke, for what? What facilities, a gym, so now I am paying $25 for internet and a gym, ridiculous. Last time I paid a facilities fee was at the Biltmore in Arizona but they certainly had facilities to offer. There are plenty of deals to be had in the city without paying these add-on fees.

Would it be too much to add another receptionist?We loved our room, which was spacious and nicely renovated. I wish that the in room information book was up-to-date, because while it claimed the gym was closed, I found out upon checkout that it actually was operational. Definitely ask for a nice view- we looked out onto Times Square, but I hear other rooms have a brick wall. Service was really mixed. Some staff members excelled, including two front desk women who went above and beyond the call of duty. The barman was also friendly. That being said, doormen were obnoxious and the maids stared at us like what are you doing here, rather than say hello or respond to ours. We also had to deal with an unpleasant man at Guest Services. So this area could definitely use some work. Also, for all of the renovations that the hotel has done, it doesn't seem on par with other four stars we have stayed at (although this could also be due to the service)!

Not knowing New York at all and how things work we found the help and guidance from the concierge desk Julissa very friendly and a relief that the hotel gives this service. Got a booking via TripAdvisor for a very good discount, which fitted our budget. When we arrived, the hope of the hotel being a perfect location to all the sites we wanted to visit was perfect. Walking distance to Broadway Theaters and Time Square, while the subway train station was at the corner of the hotel. The reception is beautiful and easy to book in. Early arrival allowed our bags to be stored for us in the hotel until the room was ready. Tired and excited as we were we went for a stroll in Central Park until the room was ready. Our room on the 14th floor had a window looking onto 7th Avenue. It was quiet and the bathroom was small but a comfortable bed for the weary bodies. The hotel and room was clean with a friendly atmosphere. I will come back. Suggestion: maybe a self help coffee station in the room would have been very nice. ","Pretoria, South Africa",5,4.0

Then 2 days ago when my reservation ended, I fell really sick and couldn't even move from the bed, I wanted to extend the reservation a few more days, but haven't the strength to take the phone to give credit card info, or go downstairs to make the payment by cash... They called me several times in the room, but I was too sick to talk, so they finally sent the security to my room the next morning, after I unhooked the phone in the room. When they realized I was really sick, they did everything to help me, they took the cash with me in the room to make the reservation for me, which is totally against their policy, they offered to call my family, hospital, anbulance and gave me all the assistance I could need, the girl from the front Desk and the security guy even bought me soup, fruits and Gatorade, and brought me to the room 10 minutes later- they are true angels!

Ashley was rude and uncaring. Well, I did meet with the manager, Elizabeth. She saved the day and the stay. We were immediately provided with a clean room with apologies. She was gracious, accommodating, personable, professional. Accidents happen and I really believe the room situation was simply an oversight. Ashley needs customer service training and Elizabeth needs a raise. She is a great front-of-the-house representative for the establishment.

For a number of reasons we chose the Park Central. The price was reasonable, the location 'excellent' and it rated higher than many other places of similar price. We thought we would give it a go. Location is great - in one sense. 56 and 7th is very convenient to central park, broadway and shopping. Problem is it is a very busy and thus prone to be very noisy. We stayed in an upgraded room, but opted not to pay another 28 to 40 dollars to be higher up which may have been a mistake. Two nights we were up till 3 or so because of the noise outside, in the morning, the hallways were often noisy so we got woken early. We always travel with ear plugs. am a light sleeper, my wife is not. We both had challenges. Management was sympathetic but could not move us. The rooms are nice, clean, nothing fancy, beds are very comfortable. Staff is quite pleasant. They are a big enough hotel that they get a moderate number of groups/conferences which is not always great since they can't handle large volumes well - ie long lines at elevator or check in. One thing in price is the resort fee - covers gym and the internet, is about another 20 or so dollars a day. The gym is ok, I would say average. Overall the hotel is fine and reasonably priced but it is noisy. We stayed at the Empire in the past which gets a significantly lower rating on trip advisor but is far quieter, in our experience. If you stay and are a light sleeper you have been warned. Remember a good nights sleep is worth a lot.","Calgary, Canada",68,3.0

We were near a freight elevator, so that might have had something to do with it, but it sounded like a large cart was rolling around on a tile floor somewhere near us all night long. I'm not sure if we were near a laundry facility or maintenance was going on, but it was awful. Add to that the sounds of neighbors in the halls and a fire alarm going off around midnight, and we did not get the rest we needed after a long day of travel and touring the city. We can forgive small issues, but after the sounds of something rolling that probably didn't come from a guest room, I don't think we'll be back.

I first stayed in 2010 and I loved it then which is why I returned. The hotel has recently been refurbished and is almost unrecognisable from my first stay, apart from the outside. Receptionist staff could have been friendlier upon check in and at first informed me that they had no booking under my name. Luckily I had printed my booking confirmation and they were able to find the booking. My first name and surname had been switched on the booking which I was informed happened from time to time. We were on the 3rd floor on the east side of the building. We had hoped to be higher up and have a better view but that's the luck of the draw. Our room was spacious, in particular the bathroom. Everything was beautifully maintained and very clean. We were a little disappointed that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room but we had everything else we needed. The main negative about our room was the windows. Single glazed aluminium frames meant the room was very loud but also extremely cold. The heating in the room only seemed to blow out cold air. However the bed was the comfiest bed I have ever slept in anywhere. I really wanted to bring the bed home with me! So whilst the room was chilly the beds kept us nice and warm. The restaurant is now closed but this doesn't surprise me as there are so many restaurants and coffee shops nearby I would imagine the hotel found it hard to compete. There is a small coffee house type area in the restaurant which sells drinks and snacks although this closes around 10pm I think and they had run out of English breakfast tea bags when we wanted to buy a drink on our final day. The walls must be quite thin as we could literally hear everything in the room next door but I think we had an extremely noisy family staying next to us. The hotel arranged transport for our journey back to JFK who provided excellent service for good value. The concierge desk were very helpful during our stay. I notice from the reviews a lot of people complaining about the facilities fee. These complaints are unjust. The facilities fee was made clear to me during the booking and isn't bad value considering we had unlimited wifi for up to 5 devices and we were able to store our baggage at the hotel after checking out on our final day. There was also a gym available to use included in the facilities fee but we didn't use it. The location of this hotel is perfect. Very close to Central Park (less than a 5 minute walk), close to Times Square, 5th avenue, and there is a subway station right outside the station. I would definitely stay here again. This hotel certainly offers value for money. ","Cardiff, United Kingdom",165,4.0

After I asked what the problem was they then tell me the problem was me using a company credit card because it had the company name instead of my name on the card. It's hard for me to believe that any hotel in year 2015 has never seen a company card before...... problem being no one ever thought to simply say maim do you have another form of ID or another credit card. Which I had no problem providing once I was told what all the criminal treatment was about. Customers don't know your payment preferences or policies until you tell them. Instead of causing a scene in the lobby and making a big deal the 1st associate should have asked for an alternate form of payment & avoided the whole situation and ordeal. Then it feels like -12 degrees outside in NYC & I get to the room and the bed doesn't have adequate linen. No quilt. No comforter. No goose down. No blanket.

Here's my update:The hotel rooms are still quite amenity-less; no complimentary shower cap or coffee-maker. They do provide two little bottles of body lotion and in the shower a body wash, shampoo and conditioner and yes, there is a hair dryer. There is also no restaurant in the hotel though, why would you eat in an expensive hotel restaurant when there are so many restaurants in the area?One of the issues I had with the hotel was that they had a sparse, cold lobby area. they have resolved that by turning the former restaurant into a lovely lobby/bar area with plenty of comfortable seats and couches as well as a beautiful bar that opens just in time for happy hour at 5. (So, as I said, I can live without their restaurant.) It would be nice if they served an interesting bowl of nuts (cashews, almonds, etc) instead of the sweet and cheddar popcorn but hey, I didn't go their to eat anyway!They also have a new convenience spot called Central Market where you can get coffee, water and all sorts of delicious looking pastries (we didn't try any because they looked so fattening). It was a little odd that it was closed on Sunday because they person who runs it was out that day. (How can they not have other staff to cover it.) Never-the-less, there are plenty of places in the area to have breakfast for under $10 a piece. (So if you are upset by the lack of coffee-maker in the room, you will have to go out but there is the Central Market downstairs, a Starbucks next door, delis and diners everywhere close enough so you won't faint from lack of caffeine!)One thing I would suggest you do before you even bring your suitcase to your room is to check out the room. While the rooms are very pretty, we got a Classic King that literally had less than a foot between the bed and the dresser/TV stand. So we had to sidle past the bed every time we wanted to get from one side of the room to the other and my boyfriend kept banging his foot en route to the bathroom. (Had we not schlepped our luggage up and felt exhausted from the travel, we may have asked for another room.)Another improvement was the elevator situation. The last time I stayed there the elevators were slow and the waits long. This time the waits were short and the elevators were very efficient in climbing the floors.All in all, there were definitely improvements that overshadow the lack of coffee-maker in the room. And, by the way, I believe you can request one (but I am not entirely sure about that.) For location and price, I will stay there again and just get up in the morning, get dressed and go to one of the local restaurants for coffee and breakfast!","West Palm Beach, Florida",18,4.0

Location is the best near everything from Central Park to Times Square.. Having taking the ferry over from NJ, we used their bus to get within a block of the hotel and the same for the return.We arrived early at 1pm, but were told, ""the guaranteed check in time is 4pm"". Not sure if that is something they just quote robotically to everyone on a Saturday, or if our room was not ready since there was no mention of our room not being ready which is the usual hotel protocol IMO. Since we were out an about, we didn't go to our room until about 6pm. The room is beautiful (King Classic), nicely decorated, high ceilings and perfectly clean. This room type has no view which made for a very quiet night's sleep (and a dark room since were were surrounded by brick buildings.)The bathroom was a huge disappointment. Though decorated nicely, the door did not open fully as it completely hit the toilet. I'm a 5'6"", size 6 person and had to walk in sideways to get in, then shut the door to get to the toilet or tub. The single sink was in an alcove between two walls in the bathroom and I would hit my elbows on the 2 walls when doing my hair. If we were staying more than one night, I certainly would have raised this as an issue to the hotel, but just thought I'd share with my fellow TA'ers instead.We had a few drinks at the bar. Not the best time I've ever had at a hotel bar. Bartenders were again very robotic, not social and measured every single think they poured from wine to liquor. Thought that was ""cold"" service for the high prices ($16/glass house wine). You do get ""free"" popcorn with your drinks that was very good (cheese and caramel coated).I can't say service was bad, but I did find it very impersonal - like every employee hated their job and was tolerating me. As a born and raised NYer I get what our reputation is, but the hospitality industry does not have the right to be less than personable/friendly/outgoing/etc.Enjoy your stay and consider an upgraded room if you want a little more ""elbow room"" than a King Classic.","Roxbury, New Jersey",144,4.0

Located up by 59th and Columbus Circle - which is far enough out from the madness of Times Square to be a little quieter (in a New York context!) yet still only a 15 min walk back into that same madness. Transport links are good nearby thanks to the proximity of Columbus Circle and 7th Avenue, plus the open top tour buses leave from stops about 10 min walk away. Getting around is therefore a breeze. Nearby attractions such as Carniege Hall and of course Central Park itself make the location even better.From the outside this hotel is pure NYC. It's gothic and grand and everything you'd imagine from a hotel in a movie. Inside it's wonderful - appointed as if the art deco era never left in a very grand style. Customer service is excellent, whether it's front desk, concierge, the bar staff, or the cleaners. Everyone on the team is keen to talk, help and make your visit that little bit better.We had a room on the 5th floor on the side nearest Central Park, facing inwards to the court, which does mean the room was a little darker than perhaps it should have been but minimised the noise from the road outside. The room is plenty large for New York - 2 double beds, a more than adequate wardrobe, a desk, seat, big TV and a great bathroom, with a 'stubby' bath that doubles as the shower, with some great artwork round the walls. The provided toiletries are above average qualty being provided by CC Bigelow which is just down the road from the hotel.All in all how can I recommend this hotel? It's clean, friendly, comfortable, high quality and everything you need to come back to and base from for a week in New York. I almost don't want to tell anyone about it because it'll become too popular and prices will go up. Yes it's also a bargain for the service you receive. Visiting New York?

The 7th Ave location was perfect for my needs: even on a bitterly cold night I was able to walk to and from the Neil Simon Theatre. Desk staff are cordial and helpful. When I arrived about 45 minutes before check-in time, the desk clerk made a room switch to my advantage to let me check in early. It was a quiet room at the end of a hallway facing the inner courtyard. The décor of the room (indeed the whole hotel) was sleek and sophisticated. NYC hotel rooms can be notoriously cramped, but this was surprisingly spacious, with a roomy closet. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Pump bottles fixed to the shower wall dispensed lavender-scented body wash, shampoo, conditioner. I would have welcomed a disposable shower cap, fluffier bath towels, and a ventilation fan in the bathroom. And why is there no clock radio in the room? Would it have disrupted the feng shui? It was annoying to have to reach for my phone and open it whenever I needed to check the time. Form should never preclude function in a hotel room.In stark contrast to this minimalism, the bathroom art was visually jarring: a gigantic, vivid, big-red-lipped head of a woman stared out over the top of the toilet. Bad choice. The non-optional $25/day facilities fee on top of the room charge includes luggage check and storage until 9 pm (handy when checkout is 11 am and you’ve got an evening departure), free calls to anywhere in the US on your room phone, use of the fitness center, and use of a computer terminal in the lobby for things like searches, directions, and airline information. The grab-and-go snack shop in the lobby is handy, and the items I had were all fresh and very good. The restaurant always looked empty or even closed. But for a sit-down breakfast, there are plenty of choices: a couple of delis less than a block away, a diner across the street, and a patisserie down the street, for starters. The reasonably comfortable open lounge area includes tables/outlets for laptops.","Salem, Massachusetts",45,4.0

As much as I was happy for them I was also very nervous. I didn’t want them to come back home with any bad memories! I did a lot of research with my hotel booking and this one kept coming back on my short list (although it was a slight bit over my budget). Once I booked the accommodation I couldn’t wait for my parents to get there.Obviously it wasn’t as easy as I expected. My parents experienced some flight delays due to which they arrived a day later than the actual check in date. Now according to the policy I couldn’t make any changes to the booking I had made neither could I get a refund for the one night stay that my parents were missing. It took me a bit of time to get to the right people who had the authority to do that but once I reached them my problem was resolved in a matter of hours. Not only did I get a refund for my one night stay, my parents were also given an upgrade to a premier king!I would like to thank Don and Tom for their help and support and making this a memorable experience for my parents.

They couldn't help with the simplest things like mailing postcards, providing stamps to either international or national post and when we were informed they didn't sell stamps they seemed bothered by having to tell us where we could get them - this sounds really unimportant but this was after several other incidents so we were just over the mediocre service at this hotel. New toilet paper rolls took approx. 18-22 hours to receive even though we reminded them 2-3 times, they didn't have adapters in the reception to lend but luckily there was one person in the staff at the hotel that went over and beyond - Quimby I think his name was he is the the head of guest relations he lent me his private adapter for our entire stay. He put all the other staff to shame with their poor service standard - if the rest of the staff were like him the hotel would be a lot better.The elevators were the worst - floor 10-20 or 22 shared TWO elevators and for about 18-24 hours there was only ONE elevator working. Waiting 20-45 minutes for the elevator is NOT OK! Absolutely terrible!The hotel looks really nice, modern and renovated but it was just on the surface...

I had stayed there years ago with some girlfriends for a weekend getaway and loved the location as well as the staff (we relied entirely on the conceirge back then to plan our weekend!) When my parents, my own family and I decided to visit New York for a few days, I immediately suggested the Park Central... The hotel has been refurbed since my first visit and the lobby is lovely. The rooms are much nicer too... We had a good time generally until the last night. My husband, daughter and I left the room with just our key cards and when we tried to get back into the room, we were denied access. I left my husband and my 6-year old by the room and went down to reception to sort this situation out. I did not have ID and knew it was perfectly logical that a member of staff would need to verify that I was, in fact, the guest registered to the room but the member of reception staff was so rude and unpleasant, she managed to make me so angry! She said that she would call security and they would meet us at our room. After 15 minutes of waiting, I used the public phone on our floor and the operator tried his very best to help me. He could not get security and he could not locate a manager to help. At this point, my husband went down to try and get some help. In the meantime, after being on the line with me for a long time, the operator managed to locate someone in security who was on his way to me. My husband found out that the woman who had been so atrocious to me had sent security to the wrong room. The security man was more-than-pleasant, verified my identity and said that we did not need to go down to reception again and that he would arrange new key cards to be delivered. The man who brought them was also more-than-pleasant and apologized for the lady at reception's attitude. In fact, everyone was so nice after that, I gave this hotel more than 1 star! The only other negative, in our experience was the facilities charge. It is weird that it is not included in our rate - we have travelled all around the world and have never been charged additional for the use of the facitilities (except wifi and parking, if we specifically requested them ). I feel kind of cheated! I don't recall being informed of this charge when I booked our rooms... I probably would have booked at one of our party's other choices, if I had been informed, purely on a principal basis!","Nassau, New Providence Island",6,3.0

Storage fees for your bags kept till 9pmI laughed. I said to her these are facilities that are included in the room rate in other hotels especially if the room rate is $200 or more. And that I had never heard of a resort fee being charged for a hotel in New York. Hotels with resort facilities like a pool, tennis court, golf course etc but not for a New York City hotel. I then went on to explain to her that I wouldn't be using these facilities. I had a cell phone which I used for local calls; we were checking out at 11am and would not have time to use the gym or use the storage facilities. As for Wi-fi that was usually complimentary or guests had the option to pay for it. She refused to budge -- stating that the fee was mandatory regardless of whether guests used the facilities or not. Unfortunately we could not cancel our booking as it was made through expedia. But the whole check in process just left me with a very bitter after taste.Sad way to end our holidays after a very pleasant time at the Westin Grand Central. I think the hotel spent a lot of money with the renovations and are looking for a way to recoup their expenses and as such came up with this fraudulent resort fee. Good luck to them. If you are happy with paying for services you don't use then this hotel will be an option for you. However if you are not, I do not recommend this is a hotel option in New York. We had also booked the hotel because they advertised a "" modern"" bath-tub. Sadly the bath-tub was tiny and would only accommodate children or little people. ","London, United Kingdom",22,1.0

I got the reservation off the discount web-site, Hotels Tonight. I paid around $200, plus an additional facilities fee at the hotel. So this is a bargain for Manhattan, and it is very conveniently located close to Columbus Circle.This place is huge. It occupies an entire city block, and the rooms are on both sides of a corridor, around a central courtyard. I was in a room on the 7th floor. I have a feeling that this is the floor where they put their budget travelers, because there was a big party going on down the hall and it reeked of marijuana in the morning.I was in a room with a window looking out on the inside courtyard. Because the hotel goes many, many stories above the 7th floor, it is very dark at this level - and this is the weird thing. The rooms are very dark, and they only have one of the REALLY heavy window shades that block out all of the light. There is no light weight privacy drape that allows light through. So if you open the heavy shade in order to get a little light, then you can see right into the rooms across the courtyard. In the morning I had to work in my room, and to get light I opened the shade. I could see right into the rooms at my level and below me - I counted 13 beds I was looking at, including some fellow walking around in his underwear. So take you pick - live in a cave, or be a peeping Tom!Otherwise the place is a good value for Manhattan. The beds are comfortable, the room is small but adequate, and the staff is very helpful.

I'm always checking out hotels based on amenities, room size, location, ambience and a host of other factors. Park Central ranks near the top for me in New York. The room and bathroom size are among some of the best for regular rooms in New York. They are comfortable, relatively spacious and well-equipped. My main knock on the hotel is something many hotels seem afflicted with; the lighting is inadequate. At Park Central that's magnified in interior rooms that don't receive a ton of natural sunlight anyway. Some pendant or overheard lighting would help tremendously. My other complaint is that housekeeping carts, at least on the floor where I stayed, are left out in the open, albeit covered. I realize this is probably both a convenience and space issue, but it can be a bit disconcerting. It seemed like a possible plot for an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" where creatures of the night would emerge from the carts in the wee hours. Yes, that's silly, but so is having the carts lined up everywhere. That aside, I would stay here again and again. The staff was friendly. The public spaces are beautiful.

The rooms were spacious (no bath though) and the decor was modern and had a great air about it. The first impression you get when you walk in is a feel of luxury for what I perceived to be a fair price. I'm sure if you paid more you could have had a room with a better view than the view of a wall and some ducting that we got but it doesn't matter as generally if you are a visitor to New York, your room is a base and nothing more.I can't really fault the hotel its self however it does get marked down for a couple of essential things. Number 1 is the service charge which I did not pick up on at the time of booking. I think this is totally uncalled for as Wifi is generally free in most hotels I have ever visited and if you let's face it most of us won't be using the gym as New York is tiring enough without being made to pay for facilities you won't use. I would have happily paid a higher basic rate which includes a proportion of this fee for the wifi but begrudge paying for things which everywhere else includes in their price. As a side note my booking voucher said I only had to pay $100 but it was actually $108.90, this is only minor but it's the principal.Number 2 was when I was asked if I required transport to the airport we happily agreed and we were told it was a fee of $65. Which was fine albeit we already knew the flat rate to JFK is $52 in a yellow cab but presumed this would be because of the pre-booking. Now the car turned up late (over 20 mins) to pick us up and because of traffic which we had to detour through a toll road to make it on time adding an additional $7.50 to the fee (after being told by the concierge specifically to pay no more than $65). Taking into account a $10 tip on top what should have cost us $62 ended up costing over $80 which after being stung with the service charge left a sour taste in the mouth after what was a great stay.Don't be put off by the negative points above as this is a great hotel but there is room for improvement by not making customers feel like they are being exploited at the end.

We have stayed there two times before this stay without any complains in particular. This is my first negative review and normally I don’t want to spend time on documenting negative experiences, but in this case I would have a bad conscious if I didn’t.I have attempted to sum it up below.1. Price: The WORST is that the PRICE you see when BOOKING the room is INCORRECT. The price announced via hotels.com and their website doesn’t include the mandatory “resort fee” which will cost you an additionally 21$ per night. This is in my mind fraud and I think the only reason Park Central does this is to look less expensive when booking. It is written on hotels.com at the very bottom of the page and in a section which you need to expand to read. If the fee is mandatory, it should be included in the room price. I don’t thing is fair to demand a collective fee for services that not every guest needs. Bottom line, the price you see when booking a room should NOT be excluded mandatory fees. 2. Amenities? Forget about coffee maker, minibar or clean glasses. 3. Service: The housekeeping was sloppy; we found hair in the bathtub and waste next to the bin from the previous guest. Drinking glasses were not replaced with clean ones by housekeeping. In 6 nights they succeeded once!! Calling the front desk to get new glasses sometimes work, but only when you actually manage to get through to the front desk. Asking for new glasses at the front desk works...again only sometimes. If you want clean glasses do both or buy plastic cups in case they should become unavailable. 4. Noise: When two rooms are separated by a door you can hear everything being said and done in the other room. Some people might like that…we don’t. The elevator is very noisy. It can be heard from inside the room 5 rooms down the hall. Luckily there are only 2 elevators so the noise is reduced, but you have wait a while if you want to use them.5. Personnel: The people working the front desk and the bell boy was very sweet and kind and seemed truly understanding of our frustrations regarding the mandatory resort fee (I guess they hear that a lot?). The doorman however could be substituted by a cardboard figure. Despite arriving with 4 suitcases (two persons and with additional hand luggage) we didn't receive any help at all, but nor was he busy.This was however our last stay EVER at Park Central hotel. Mainly due to the additional mandatory resort fee as I see as a way to trick people, and I don’t reward people I regard as frauds. For the “adjusted” total price I believe that you can find a hotel with much higher standard and good location for the same price.And “dear” Park Central manager please don't bother replying to this review as I practically don't care!","Copenhagen, Denmark",12,1.0

Lets start with the pros. The location is ideal, close to the park, walking distance to Time Square and the main road outside is definitely less busy than New York is famous for. The lobby does smell lovely, my girlfriend was adamant she had the same perfume! The room was unexpectedly quiet and the bed very comfortable. Unfortunately thats all the positive things that spring to mind. For over 400 dollars a night I expected more than just a room. We didnt even have a directory of hotel services in our room so Im not even sure what the hotel had to offer. I did request this and despite being told one would be sent up, it never materialised. Room 921 seems to be a wifi black spot as none of our devices could pick it up in our room. The charge for this was refunded however and I appreciate that. Although I think this should be complimentary given the room prices. I booked the premier room as these were said to be on 'higher floors'. I would like to know what the Hotel considers as 'higher floors'? We were on floor 9 of 21 I think, so I don't really see how less than half way up can be considered higher floors.In summary this is a nice hotel, but I just didnt feel we got what we paid for. I know New York hotel rooms are expensive in general especially over the christmas period, but you still expect more than just a room. Even smiling staff can be enough to make it worth the money but I didnt real feel much warmth during our stay.I'm putting this one down to a bad room in a good hotel but unfortunately thats enough to put me off staying again given the choice NYC has to offer.","Canterbury, United Kingdom",8,2.0

A special mention to Shpreda at the reception desk (she's wonderful working, attention to guest, helpful and kind and polite), and to David Vargas (the best bellman in the whole hotel, who was ALWAYS taking care of us, our transfer back to the airport,which is cheaper if you book through the hotel directly as with a company, and the rest of the needs we have had during our stay there). Just maybe should mention 2 small details (as client and as hotel worker,and an experienced traveller...): the bathroom comparing with the size of the room (and for 2 people) is too small for that categorie of hotel. Could not be making up at the same time 2 women, and while one of us were in the wc, no one could be also in the bathroom as there was no space enough. The other point to mention is just a small detail: the housekeeper did not fold our pijamas any time during the whole stay. I don't know if is not a habit in USA, but all I've been travelling all over the world, and never happens to me... in spite of those 2 things, our stay was incredible, amazing, and 100% sure, if any time we come back to New York, our hotel will be Central Park Hotel!!

The location is superb, well situated in midtown and with the central park close enough for a morning run. The entrance and the reception is ok, polite and friendly.I already read online that there is a facility fee, but you are still surprised when you have to agree to purchase a package at a fee of 25 USD a night. This package includes nothing really useful (domestic calls, baggage storage (who is going to store his baggage every day at the baggage storage if you have a room for a week???)), except the use of wifi. Best part of the offer is you can hookup up to five different devices (for free...) to the wifi. Which comes in handy if you are travelling with 3 phones and two laptops. Not really.The room however is nice. I was told they were redone this year and they are as you expect from a standard hotel: not that big, but large enough for business travelers. Bathroom amenities are nice and the iron equipment in the room is convenient. Huge television with crystal clear image and nothing to complain about. Room is also very clean.Water temperature of the shower could be better. It is hot enough to shower, but not warm enough to take a bath. All in all a good business hotel, and even with the 25 usd included not that expensive given the quality of the room and the location. Breakfast is expensive and the buffet is small, I used it twice but wouldn't recommend it at all. Actually the only thing that would get me considering another hotel was the smell in the lobby.

Fortunately nobody was there in the room, but you can imagine my horror. Hurriedly I came back to reception and lady there told me that I was given a room which was not ""cleared"" properly. I was in no mood to argue with her as I was much tired, and accepted a room with two beds, instead of one. This clearly was hassle as NY hotel rooms are anyway a match box and here you have two beds to occupy whatever space was available.I did not find service to be very good, but then in NY hardly you expect any. There was very limited choice in breakfast, and almost nothing for a strict vegetarian. Hotel has a small shop within the premises, they serve coffee / drinks etc, but don't serve any hot food (no heating / microwave - surprisingly).Location is great. You have good food choices nearby.

If you are a regular user of consolidator websites, the fare you see when you book your hotel should be the final fare. There should not be an incremental facility charge for wifi and fitness center (which is underwhelming). In 2014, the hotel should either disclose the amount owed by building that in to the fare or eat the charge. No one charges for Wifi these days and unless you are in Vegas, no one charges for gym usage these days. It was a very disappointing end to what had turned out to be a very surprisingly good stay.

It was an excellent venue for getting to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade - one block to 6th, going downhill, you could not miss it even if you were arriving after the start. We were also in the same building with Starbucks and steps away from a dozen great restaurants, from the famed Carnegie Deli to Rosie O'Grady's. Traveling as a family of 4, with older kids, the room and bed sizes were key to making a 5 day stay in NYC bearable, and Park Central did not disappoint. This hotel has done an outstanding job at accurately describing their room categories on the website and all was a s described. The location was superb, the beds were true queens and kings (not fulls and doubles), the accommodations were very nice and the rooms were very clean, however that's about it. The head line sums it up: no mini-bar, no shower-caps or any extras, no room services, difficult time getting the front desk to pick up a call. With one exception, service at this place taken down to the minimum. The exception is the lounge/restaurant at Park Central. If you feel like treating your company to a special evening, venture out to the lounge/restaurant and ask for Nancy. This lady might as well own the place: she truly has a knack for making people feel comfortable and pampered. She reminded me of an iconic Italian mother-in-law you'd see in movies or an upscale bed and breakfast owner. She truly cares about her job and the people she serves! Someone give this lady a promotion or, better yet, put her in charge of hotel's hospitality/customer relations!","Houston, Texas",25,4.0

It's great for first time NYC visitors because it's so central! The rooms are lovely, clean, the beds are extra comfortable! Except I didn't get any sleep because we were put next to the elevator and other guests were very loud as early as 6am. I will admit it's very expensive for what it is as they only provide you with a place to sleep, there's no mini bar, or place to keep your water cold, and no room service offered either. The service over all is average, depending on who you came into contact with, but I found most of the staff to be judgemental and unhelpful excluding a small number of nice people. Although the bar is a lovely place to relax at any time of the day! The resturant has potential, it could be a nice well know place to eat if they Inclued a wider range of meals on their menu. My first trip here was great last year no problems what so ever. This year has been a horrible experience, my lack of sleep added to anxiety I already have, the staffs behaviour and reactions to certain situations stressed me out far too much, and they ran my bank cards without my permission numerous times and in doing so the bank put a 24 hour block on all my funds. I feel unsafe for a number of hours as the hotel manager locked us out of our room (myself and a child) and faced the possibility of having no where to sleep in New York for a night. Consequently I left this hotel in order to enjoy the remaining days of my trip, I'm currently staying on the upper west side and haven't had any issues here. Over all the park central hotel is fabulous (especially if you get a room away from the elevator) , the location is great, it's the service that's poor, and it's all not worth the price they charge.

Upon our arrival, the staff was quick to get us checked in. We also drove in, and the valet staff was quick to help us unload and valet park out vehicle. The entire hotel is clean, and attractive. The front desk staff is friendly and helpful, and also made checkout a breeze, and our rental car was ready for us by the valet within 10 minutes of our checkout. The lobby is even scented. Our Premier Room featured double queen beds, and was meticulously clean. The rooms were recently remodeled, and our room featured a huge Samsung flatscreen HDTV, cordless telephone, and a clock radio with iPod dock. The beds were comfortable and allowed us to sleep well the 2 nights we were there. Everyone knows that visitors to NYC find it hard to hail an NYC cab, but the valet staff was more than willing to help, and was able to quickly help us hail a cab to take us where we wanted to go around NYC (even though we rented a car to drive to NYC, we didn't actually drive the car in NYC and either walked or took a taxi everywhere we went).The only downsides that I can think of are that, for the price you pay per night to stay here, the hotel had no vending machines (a call to the front desk confirmed this), and the small pastry shop inside the hotel sells drinks, though it was $8.00 for two sodas. This is by far the most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in, and all of the less-expensive hotels had vending machines, even on the floor I stayed on. Also, even though wifi is provided free of charge, it was extremely slow to connect my Mac to, and I ended up relying on my smartphone's mobile hotspot feature for my entire stay. But that's probably because several large groups were staying at the hotel, and were probably all logged onto wifi at the same exact time (the hotel allows for up to a total of five devices to be connected per room for free).

I suspect some floors are renovated so guests enjoy better rooms. In one room , there is only one light by the bedside and we have to ask them to bring in extra lighting, then we found the bathtub does not drain well and they have some one come in and remove a big clog of hair from the shower drain before it works well. In another room, the air conditioning is so noisy and the safe has no electric supply and does no work, so they come in again and fix everything. Finally we got to sleep for a while and we got awakened by a fire alarm that went on for ten minutes before an overhead announcement informing us that it was a false alarm and told the guests to stay in their rooms. Overall it gives me an impression that the floor we are staying in is outdated and had old infrastructure and above all there seems to be no quality assurance program whereby everything is checked before they deliever the rooms to the guests and they just fix everything as the complaints come in. There is also the facility fee that they claim will cover local calls and wifi and it is mandatory that we cannot delcine , as we have our own phones and do not wish to pay extra after paying $400 per room per night.

I've been staying there for a few days every two months or so. Unfortunately, all aspects of the property - service, housekeeping, basic facilities have been on the decline. For each of my last visits they have had only one bank of elevators operational - leading to long delays to get from or to one's room. Housekeeping is very poor - with the staff barging in despite a DBD sign. They were miffed that I had overslept & disturbed their routine. Articles left behind are never returned. I thought I had a room rate that included breakfast - only to be directed to a little kiosk in the lobby that was handing out muffins and coffee. After about 10 visits in he past two years, I have decided not to return. There are other Hotels that make more of an effort. ",,20,2.0

The room itself was quite far from the elevator, but otherwise fine. The bedroom part was relatively large by NYC standards, but the bathroom door could only open halfway before hitting the toilet bowl. The gym was small and had decent equipment.

The hotel is pretty decent, but it was only a place to hang our coats and sleep. Summary:Hotel: Fairly clean and well-maintained. Elevators were irritatingly slow and old - at times we had to wait easily 5 - 8 minutes (and while carrying luggage, made it impossible). We never ate at the hotel, quite expensive when there's plenty of other food options around in Midtown.Rooms: We had the refurbished rooms, very clean and modern. Don't expect complimentary bottled water or welcome drinks etc; it is a NYC hotel anyway. Bath was modern and clean, well maintained as well. However soap / shampoo dispensers were plugged to the wall. Makes it feel a bit tacky.Sleep quality: Decent, can be noisy even at the 5th floor (it is NYC anyway). Pillows a bit too soft but otherwise bed kept us sufficiently knocked out.Location: Good for Midtown; two blocks from Central Park, right opposite Carnegie Hall, in between two sets of subway lines. If you're looking to stay close to Broadway and all the shows then it's the right place. Otherwise far from East / West Village and the financial centres. Close to MOMA, and a good 20 minute walk to the Met. Good if you're a bit older, but not great if you're looking for a supremely good time. Service: Bellboys were superb; we made friends with these chaps. Front desk was efficient, no complaints. If you're looking to book taxis or airport transfers ask the bellboys first - they'll save you a few dollars (concierge is outsourced and charge a hidden service fee?). One horrible experience was when I accidentally left my sunglasses next to the computers by the lobby. Called the hotel 3 minutes after I left (was in a cab) to ask somebody to pop by and hold it for me - but the 'Hotel Guest Relations Officer' couldn't be bothered to walk over or get hold of front desk to get it. Insisted that somebody will turn it over to security. Obviously, it was lost forever.","Singapore, Singapore",16,3.0

The ice machine didn't work on our floor during our entire stay. (Not complaining just stating the fact...got some exercise walking down two floors to get ice.) Didn't experience the personal touch from the staff that others mentioned. We came and went without hardly a smile from anyone on the staff. Not a big deal to me but some might like a bit friendlier feel. (We didn't have too many questions so that limited our interaction.) Subway (N/Q/R) close.

Good job to the front desk agents, the food, the security and most importantly the concierge. I only stayed for 1 night which I regret leaving but the best part was when the concierge arranged champagne to be delivered to me as a surprise! Check inI love it! Fast and easy the check in process was. As the anxiety builds up, i was immediately greeted. I think the reason why the process was so fast and convenient is because the front desk asks you all kinds of questions. Questions leading all the way to parking, so I didn't even have to ask a thing, and before i knew it I had my room key!The RoomI love it! It was clean and cozy. That's all I ask for, something that looks and feels luxurious. Amenities there fully stocked, bed really clean (their was no bed hair trust me I checked) and the bathroom was clean as well.Park KitchenI love it! Food was really good here, I ate the Park Kitchen Steak and it was amazing and not bad in pricing to compared to other steakhouses in New York. Their Dinner is open until 10pm and they even have a cocktail menu.ConciergeI love it! I was able to be helped by Julissa with a few questions about dinner reservations (which lead me to eat The Park Kitchen Steak) and later found out that she surprised me with champagne to my room.

This hotel was great, because of the location it was close to everything we needed. Unfortunately the first impressions of a hotel are really important - when we got off our flight and arrived at New York there was no bell man to help us with our bags and we were left to do it ourselves, then the manager of the hotel didn't welcome us she sent us to another of the reception staff instead. The reception staff were okay but they could have been more helpful and friendly. Our room was very nice (because we upgraded to get a better view) we were in the 10th floor and had three windows looking out to 7th avenue. One small thing was there was only one mirror and that was in the bathroom - it would have been great to have one in the room as well. Our beds were also very comfortable!A big negative point was the key cards. Apparently the key cards are easily effected by magnets around them so about 4/5 times while we were there they wouldn't work in our door. This was pretty frustrating, especially on the first night when we were tired and just wanted to go to bed. This meant we had to go down to reception and change them - or call the security man who was nice but not very fast at getting to us.We had wifi included in our room and it wasn't great - it was pretty slow at peak times and only really worked in the bar and restaurant.Okay positives...the bar and restaurant was very friendly as were the staff there. We had a very good burger and fries there one evening and it was nice and quiet.The concierge was also very helpful when we had to change our dinner plans on the last night because of rain and he had many suggestions.Honestly we did not spend a lot of time in the hotel - it was just a shame that they weren't more friendly while we were there. On the night with lots of rain, there was a very long line to get taxi, including us and other that couldn't speak English. The bell man hailing the taxis broke his umbrella and left but didn't come back leaving us all pretty stranded. In the end we walked but it would have been nice to have more staff around to help or even tell us that there would not be any free taxi's (which is what the concierge told us when we went inside to ask).All in all our trip was not ruined by the hotel but it would have been such a great addition to our holiday if we had had a nice welcome and more staff smiling around the hotel (oh and the cleaners were all very friendly - especially compared to the reception staff)It would have to be a really great hotel to make us come back again, so I'm pretty sure we will not come back here but I guess I could recommend it to a friend in the future if they don't mind the less personal aspect of it.","Glasgow, United Kingdom",0,3.0

At the hotel door a burly guy grabbed our luggage and said "" We will handle these, sir"". At the lobby there were three clerks busy working at their computers, not one bothered to look up and perform our check in, they merely pointed to the next clerk, who did the same. At my third try I managed to catch the attention of these majesties and finally checked in. We were told the luggage would be brought to our room and I had the feeling we would be shot if we tried to carry them ourselves. So half an hour later we were still sitting on our beds, tired and sleepy and cold (more about this below) waiting for our luggage to arrive, anxious to unpack and turn in. After my wife urged me for the tenth time, I finally collected enough courage to go down to the lobby to check what was happening with our bags. Sure enough, they were sitting cozily on a luggage cart, untouched but fortunately not stolen. So I decided to steal our own baggage, trying to hide behind other customers so that I am not observed from the reception counters. Nobody noticed.While waiting for our luggage I had tried to get some heat in the room but all the air conditioning unit was able to do was to blow out cold air. Now remember this is NYC at the end of October, 50 F with a cold drizzle. When I got back to the room with our bags I again tried to coax some heat out of the unit, with no avail. All I got was a cold draft. So I called reception who was very helpful for a change and told me she was sending up somebody immediately to check the unit. One hour and three calls later there was a timid knock on the door. Opening the door revealed a maintenance person who very embarrasedly told me that the room unit was perfectly OK, it was just that hotel management had decided to turn off the central heating but it would be turned on at midnight if the weather got any colder. Now, coming from a warm climate and spending close to 500 bucks a night for this sort of treatment, I found it a bit odd that the hotel management saw it fit to decide on my behalf whether I needed heat or not. Anyway, this guy made a very gracious suggestion and said if we wanted more blankets we could always call reception. Well I was under the impression that if I paid this kind of money I sort of had the privilige to call reception any time I wished but I let it go. At least this guy had the honesty to tell me the truth that the reception people would not.So that night we froze under our measly blankets and toward sunrise sure enough we got a warm trickle out of the screaming AC unit. That day although we were out for business I kept the unit blowing at max heat and full blow, preparing for a cold night. Surprisingly that night heating (perhaps I should say warming) was on and I said to myself, OK, maybe this was a one time case. How wrong I was!! The next day and night we were again left freezing. I wish me and my wife were preparing for an Arctic cross country on foot because this was certainly a fine training ground.When we finally checked out I was told of the ""Facilities Fee"" for 20 dollars plus tax which was conveniently left out of the check in briefing. However I was so glad to get out of this miserable establishment that I would have paid even more out of gratitude.The long and short of it is, the location is great and this is the only good thing about this hotel. Do not be fooled by the fancy ads and posters telling you how beautifully the hotel has been renovated because the interiors were the most tasteless decoration I have ever seen anywhere. The room obviously hates you and wants to kick you out once you have paid your 500 bucks and the ""facility fee"".My advice: select any of the 4-5 star hotels in the area. None of them can be worse.","Antalya, Turkey",6,1.0

Noting explained to us or made easy (a little off putting) but then again we were tired. No one helped with our bags, even the cab driver tried to get someone to help but no luck (we arrived around 8.30 p.m. so maybe concierge busy). The restaurant was closed for a private party and no room service available so had to go out to find some food (okay but not ideal). Then we went to our room and the key cards did not work (10th floor). This happened 3 days in a row and the hotel receptionists just kept saying keep away from your phone (which we did & had been doing from the start) ! Did not really apologise just blamed it on us. The room was clean but the corridors and lifts appeared a bit shabby (the lift had hand marks all over it) again a little off putting. No heating in the room - apparently it was too early for the hotel to put their heating on - so we were a little cold for a few nights. It was quite expensive - and watch out for all the taxes they add on to your bill (for New York State, New York City and then a New York occupancy tax - again for both the state and the city.I booked the hotel through expedia.com and they sort of allowed for some taxes but it did not really add up when we came to pay. Quoted $2,359 for 5 nights but then the total came to $2671 (and please note the rate of tax changes every day !) All very confusing but I am sure it helps keep New York state & city both nice and wealthy. Lastly, the noise (and you can't really get away from the noise in NY) - try to get a room high up e.g from the 10th as the sounds from the road can be heard at all times (although the double glazing was pretty good) but being higher will help ( and the noise will be less bothersome) Take ear plugs if a very light sleeper.","London, England, United Kingdom",4,3.0

Our stay at the Park Central Hotel in NYC was, overall, a very good experience. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It is within walking distance of Time Square, Lincoln Centre and Central Park (south). We also walked from the hotel to Bloomingdales and Barneys. Lots of restaurants, stores etc. right outside the hotel door on 7th Avenue and there is a Starbucks right in the hotel with access from the street which was AMAZING for morning coffee!! This hotel is also right across the street from Carnegie Hall.When we arrived in NYC by train (Penn Station) the weather was beautiful (75 degrees and sunny). We walked from Penn Station (around 34th street) up to our hotel with our wheel-able luggage. This took approximately 20 minutes. We did the same on the return to Penn Station after the trip. Good saving on taxis!We had a room with a King size bed. The hotel has recently been renovated and the renovations are quite nice. The hotel room was smaller in actuality than what the picture on the hotel's website depicts (trick photography?) although the space was large enough to move around in and there was ample room for luggage storage, etc. The window in the room faces an inner ""courtyard"" of the hotel and many rooms face this inner courtyard. Therefore, you have to keep the blind drawn on your window or you are completely visible to all other rooms within this courtyard (as they are to you as well!!). That being said, our ""inner"" room was probably much quieter than a room facing 7th Avenue and we weren't too concerned about a view from the window as we spent little time in the room. Wide screen T.V. was great, bed comfortable and all amenities in the room were good except we prefer wrapped plastic cups to real glassware, which was provided, as you are never quite sure how or when these glasses are washed/handled. The only real complaint was that the water pressure on the shower was really not great, although it was adequate enough to take a shower. There were no complimentary shampoos/conditioners but rather dispenser bottles that were ""locked"" to the shower wall (why would anyone really want to steal these items?). You had to pump many times to get enough shampoo out of the bottle, but once again, the end result was adequate for our purposes.The hotel charges a Facility Fee of $20 per night for luggage storage upon departure and WiFi as well as ""private changing facilities"" in the lobby. We didn't take advantage of any of these things so this was an additional cost that the hotel does not waive even if you don't use the services.Check in and out was really fast and efficient. Check in is not until 4:00 p.m. but we did check in as soon as we arrived at approximately 2:00 p.m. and it was really straightforward and professional. We did an express check-out wherein you simply drop your room keys into a drop box as long as you have no outstanding charges on your room account.Overall, we would definitely stay here again simply because the location is really fantastic. We didn't take any taxis and walked to most places we wanted to see in the downtown or mid-town areas. You would have to take a taxi to Greenwich Village or the East Village, Soho, etc. if you wanted to visit these places, though we are saving these jaunts for our next trip!A good hotel with a fantastic location. A bit pricy (but this is NYC) and we saved money on taxis because of the fantastic location!!","Toronto, Canada",11,4.0

The rooms are ok size for NYC (you're not gonna spend much time in the room are ya?). The new bath room was great (modern shower, no tub in our room) Nice fixtures, lighted mirror. Giant 48"" TV (couldn't sit far enough back :-). There are many ways to get into PC, so depending on how you book it, you may pay extra fees that may not be disclosed by the booking agent. The bar is pretty, and comfortable for chatting...including a balcony away from the hustle & bustle. The lobby does get very very busy during changeover, and the elevators are ridiculously slow.

FIRST hotel i've ever been to who DOESN'T have slippers for their guests. Lastly -- I forgot new iphone 6 cases in the room, contacted the guest relations manager, she said they haven't found anything and referred me to their security director to fill out a form - who hasn't contacted me for the past 3 days. so basically -- the hotel staff stole my iphone cases (the staff were supposed to have put it in lost and found) , and don't take any responsbility for it.

The room: Brother and I got a larger room on the 5th floor, with two double beds and a renovated bathroom. The room itself was fine (some street noise but wasn't an issue). The windows DO open but we generally kept them closed to keep out the city's dust and noise. Although the wifi is very fast, it's ""free"" in that there's a compulsory charge that comes with the room. So if you're paying for internet, might as well use it! Our room was located quite a distance from the elevators so it was a bit of a walk, but walking wasn't an issue for us (it might be if you're with older folks or with someone who's got a bad leg). My parents had a room closer to the elevators and they had no complaints about the room. Two things that really bothered us about this place: 1. The keys. It is ridiculous that we had to change our keys a total of FIVE times for the two rooms. Imagine going back to your room after a long, tiring day and not having your door open because your key's messed up. And then making the trek back downstairs to change the keys, only to have the same thing happen the next day. This happened to both rooms, multiple times. They kept malfunctioning until the hotel eventually reprogrammed the machinery for my parents' door because none of the keys would work. What a pain. 2. Customer relations can be deplorable. My brother realised he left his sunglasses in a monogrammed leather case by the computer terminals when we got into the car, about 5 minutes later. We called front desk, asked them if they could just do a quick sweep of the computers and hold onto the sunglasses until we got back - we'd stay on hold and would really appreciate it. Front desk said that if security brought anything to lost and found, they'd let us know. Not that they would take a brisk 30 second walk around the lobby or go and ask someone to take a look real quick, but that if something came in at the end of the day, they'd let us know. We asked the attendant to just see if they were there and she wouldn't. It wasn't a busy morning and it wouldn't have taken her more than 30 seconds to walk over, grab them, and save us a tremendous amount of grief. The time she spent on the phone with us telling us she wouldn’t go and look right away was longer than what it would’ve taken her to walk around. We asked front desk if anything came in three times over the next few days– obviously nothing did. This incident was enough to turn my brother off this place completely and I doubt he’d recommend it to anyone. The hotel itself was fine, but Park Central could definitely work on their customer service if it’s the difference between a returning customer and a dissatisfied one. The hotel: - Other than the front desk incident, service was fine. Bellmen and reception were (mostly) helpful yet always ready with a smile. Housekeeping accommodated us when we took a little longer to get ready in the mornings (jetlag) but otherwise were great; we always came back to a clean and tidy room. - The hotel's airfresheners were a touch too strong. - There's a Mac computer terminal with free printing, which was handy for printing all our tour passes and boarding passes. There is a 15 minute time limit, but that's generally enough time to google where you're going for dinner and to check into flights. - We didn't eat or drink in the hotel, nor did we use the gym so can't comment.",,9,4.0

In the interim, on my second stay I had another stay in another hotel within Times Square, that one, despite being more expensive, offers smaller rooms and less professionalism than Park Central Hotel.I have been treated like a real valued customer by Park Central Hotel personnel and I would like to express my profound gratitude to Elizabeth Cacovic for the high standard dedication to her work and professionalism. I think she is one the best asset of this establishment. I also would like to congratulate Marie Paul in charge de security in the hotel. She have been very helpful to me on several occasions. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone. However, I truly believe that for the price paid, the hotel must immediately suppress their policy of charging for the internet. It makes no business sense to charge $20 for internet while for a cup of tea or coffee you get wi-fi for free at the Tisserie and Starbucks Coffee next door.

We were there a couple of hours early (with a 1 year old baby). The front desk really wasnt interested in assisting us into a room quicker. Just told us to come back at the pre-determined time. Not even an effort to accomodate. We get it, its busy, but a half decent attempt would have been nice.The hotel itself, other than the spot on central location, is not really great. Maybe its the same at all similar hotels in NYC. You are paying top dollar and not really getting anything near the quality. We upgraded to a bigger room - well that was about the size of a small room anywhere else. Noisy has heck, no sound being blocked from the street.The elevators were the tiniest I have ever been on.

The location is just perfect. You are walking distance from all the big attractions - Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue, Central Park to name just a few. You are also very close to Hell's Kitchen which has the best range of restaurants in the city.The staff were friendly and very helpful, from the desk staff to the concierge. Room service was completed daily to a very high standard.The room was an adequate size and suited our needs perfectly. The bed was huge and not the usual 2 twin beds pushed together but a proper king size. It may have been the comfiest bed I've ever slept in! The TV had a great range of channels and the other room facilities were good. One great thing I must mention is plug sockets on the bedside table lampshade. So often in a hotel, the plug point is nowhere near you bed and it's a real pain to charge your phone and have it close to you. Here at Park Central you won't have this problem. The air-conditioning worked fine and wasn't too noisy. We were on floor 16 and had no noise from outside so always got a great night sleep.The on-site coffee shop was a nice touch also. A varied range of snacks and pastries and really lovely coffee for a decent price.When booking be aware of the extra fee of $20 dollars a day. This is pretty standard in US hotels, but it's usually in the fine print. For this fee you have the use of unlimited wi-fi (which is an absolute life saver) as well as use of the gym and a safe in the room. There are also 3 PCs on site to use which is free for up to 15 minutes plus a free to use printer which came in very handy for printing off our boarding passes.I would 100% stay here again on my next trip and would highly recommend it to anybody.","Beckenham, United Kingdom",82,5.0

The have given the entire hotel a face lift. When you walk in the aroma of flowers is delightful. Beautiful. The bar has comfortable couches and intimate seating. There is a big nine screen display the runs a loop of the great things to see in New York. Our room was the typical classic king-comfy clean sheets and soft bed.Although the room was remodeled, the wallpaper was coming off the walls by the air conditioning. We never had a problem had a problem in the past until this trip. The problem this time was the missing TV remote. The TV won't run without it. There are no on/off buttons anywhere.How did housekeeping miss that when they turned the room? I called for a remote. Thirty minutes later a gentleman knocked on my door and handed me a remote with his apologies then left. The remote did not work. I immediately called the front desk again. They told me they would send someone up but couldn't say when...I let them know we were heading out for the night. Four hours later then I returned, the remote still did not work. The front desk did not say if anyone came while we were gone but 15 minutes later the same gentleman showed up. He tried to remote, no go, wiggled some wires and said the remote was defective. Another 20 minutes, and finally a remote that worked. It was after midnight by the time we settled in. I was highly aggrivated because housekeeping dropped the ball when turning the room and why did I need to call late into the evening for a silly remote. It bothers me to write poorly about the hotel because I have always had such a wonderful experience. BUT.....prior to checking out the housekeeper was in the hallway talking on her cell phone. When I checked out,low and behold she was still there chatting away. That does not pose well to me after the issues I had. For 900 bucks for two nights, everything should be perfect.

Eventually they said they would ""allow"" us to stay 1 night until we sorted but were adamant that they were full and didnt have rooms for our 6 night stay.

No apology or even admission of error and when asked how they managed it when they were ""full"" last night, they couldn't answer. The only exception was a Mr Quimby who actually took an interest in helping us. Perhaps he should train the rest of the front desk!Rooms were pretty small and bathrooms were tiny.

Extravagant lobby - but on check in, after being charged an extra $40 for an ""upgrade"" and $20 for wifi and amenities, they put me in the darkest, dankest room I've ever seen in this city. Bathtubs, advertised on booking site, are tiny and shallow. Freshly painted and carpeted, sure - but squashed, cramped, dark, filthy windows and no light. There are brighter rooms at the Holiday Inn. No one answered any of the phones, so I had to go downstairs and have a strop. Fine. Waited for a new room. Same teeny bathtub. Amenities- such as shampoo- bolted to a wall. Ice machine busted. Elevators near room out of order requiring a stomp of half a block back and forth. (I'm disabled.) No extra glasses, no newspapers, nothing. Linens not fresh. Temperature in room ridiculous - there is an ancient air conditioner that freezes you to death if you dare turn it on. Asked for a paper. Was told I'd have to pay for it. Fine - but it hasn't shown up. Just all a bit... cheap at these prices. Then discovered they were literally short-sheeting my bed. As in, a foot and a half of bare mattress at the end. Complained to manager, and they remade the bed - with the same sheets. Half a foot of bare mattress still at the end of the bed. But no one answers the phones, so I had to trek again to the lobby - in my pjs - to a manager who just nodded sympathetically and droned on about it being a bad week at the UN. (sorry, do they pay more than the other customers?) Then another manager was sent to verify the problem. Had to awkwardly stand there while a maid redid it properly. (Tipped her, of course, this isn't her fault.)I'm Canadian. I'm very bad at that sort of thing. For the same money, you can stay a few stops away on the subway at a much better hotel, one that doesn't dump its money on the vacant and abandoned lobby bar. Avoid.

Hotel is within walking distance to Central Park, Columbus Circle, Times Squares and Fifth Ave. Also, there are Subway station ""7 Ave @ 57"". We were using mostly 42 St. Times Square or 50 th Street - goes strait to South Ferry and Soho/Tribeca and so on. Around the hotel you can find a number of good restaurants, grocery stores, wine stores, pharmacy and whatever you may need as visitor in NY. We have arrived late and were given ""upgraded room"" for free ( it is a common practice actually), and it was a great surprise. Room was very spacious and had a good size and comfortable beds. Everything was very clean and we left a compliments for housekeeper Marisa who is signing while working. Lust laughing. They have a great bar. I recommend ""Whisky Manhattan"". We didn't use their restaurant, nothing I can say. Also, hotel has a small kind of coffee shop with pastries and all kind of morning food you might need. They serve ""Nespresso"" and they actually don't know what it is in details. I'm using Nespresso for many years and know exactly how it is supposed to be. But that's me. There is Starbucks, right on right corner of the hotel, outside. But I recommend to have croissants from this hotel cafe. They don't bake them, but the product they buy - is a good product. Very fresh and delicious, not like frozen commercial items in Starbucks.In general - Park Central is a very good, solid hotel and I would recommend it to everyone and, will consider it as a ""place to stay"" next visit in NYC> Forgot to mentioned WI Fi.

We will be back! The check-in staff are friendly, efficient and welcoming. We are still in our room and it's size is generous for a New York hotel. The bathroom is an equally nice size with good water pressure in shower and plenty of countertop space which is important for women and their toiletries! Drawbacks: if you have a scent allergy or sensitivity, the hotel's public spaces (particularly the lobby) are filled with an air freshener. You can taste it in your mouth and it gave me a headache in the few minutes we stood there. I do not generally have a sensitivity so this will help you understand how overpowering the scent is. The cleaning staff is incredibly noisy. A maid is cleaning the room next door and conducting a conversation with the man vacuuming the hallway. In order to be heard, both parties are hollering. Definite positives: a short walk to the Theatre district, equally short walk to Central Park and the best part of all, half a block to the famous Carnegie Deli. Carnegie's matzo ball soup is perfect on a cold New York day or if you are ever feeling a bit under the weather. All in all, I would not hesitate to stay at Park Central again and will be recommending it to others. The rooms are decorated with a clean, modern look that does not tip into a cold, minimalist feel.

There is no makeup mirror and when I asked for one from the front desk, the agent said no one has ever asked for one before and he didn't know what that was (seriously?).

Go about half a kilometer to your right and you are at Times Square.

Overall we had a great experience. The room was lovely and large for NY. Very clean. The beds were comfortable. I am reluctant to give it 5 stars for a couple of reasons. We booked our accommodations using ""miles"" through a credit card reward program. We were unaware of a 20.00 per day ""resort"" fee that was additional until after we had booked the trip. Since this was an airfare/hotel combo there was no way to cancel the hotel. Since the ""cost"" of the hotel portion was using a fair number of points I really did not understand the additional charge. Why not just state this charge up front in the cost of the daily room charge. Is there a tax reason for doing this? When I mentioned this at check-in she did ""upgrade"" us to 2 queen beds from a king bed, which in our case was an upgrade. However if I had been traveling with my fiancee that really would not have been a solution. She stated that it covered internet service, use of the gym, etc. I have to say that I am surprised that the more expensive hotels are the ones still charging for use of WIFI. I can go to most Holiday Inns, Hampton Inns and get free WIFI. A few minor other issues. When I requested more body wash because the one was nearly empty in our room they sent up several, as if to be a bit sarcastic about request. When I informed them the toilet paper holder was broken they sent more toilet paper, but did not fix the holder. And one last thing, I would not recommend paying cash at the small cafe/gift/sundry shop in the lobby. I bought a coffee and give her 20.00 for a 2.65 coffee whereupon she gave me change back for a 10.00. I said I gave her a 20, and she said no I didn't. Because she did not keep the bill out (as a good cashier should) there really was no way to dispute except to wait for the drawer count at the end of the shift by which time she could pocket the extra 10 anyway. I informed the front desk, but no one did anything. The best way to combat this type of thing is to pay by credit card. Other than those minor things we found the hotel very nice.

I will explain the bed more first. The queen bed they offer is actually a full size bed in reality. I asked them to see the double and sure enough it was smaller but it was a large twin. Apparently I was the first person this year to notice and complain. They handled it gracefully but ultimately I felt like I was living in a strange world where we both agreed the bed was smaller than advertised but nothing could or would ever be admitted to that effect. If you stay here get the queen-particularly if you have a family with you.The second complaint I had was the mandatory, undisclosed fee. The fee should really get posted to the booking sites because it really can't be avoided. I would have still stayed here but I felt like I was deceived which is the frustrating part.

Unfortunately, Park Central disappointed in almost every possible way. We arrived in New York around 5 pm on a Saturday, and it was over an HOUR wait in line to check in. (This is no exaggeration. People were buying sandwiches from the cafe next door and eating them in the line for checkout so they wouldn't miss their theater tickets.)Turns out that they had overbooked that weekend, and given our reservation to someone else. Instead of the upgraded non-smoking KIng room we had confirmed, we had to take a smoking room with one full-size bed. We were told this was all they had left. I asked if there would be a price adjustment to reflect the change, and they said no. The front desk manager did offer us a choice between free drink vouchers or complimentary breakfasts for the duration of our stay. We opted for the breakfasts--which would have been a reasonable compensation, except that when we got to the room and looked at the vouchers we had been given, they were all for drinks. (And these so-called free drink vouchers? In order to get the ""free"" drinks, you were required to purchase an entree in the hotel restaurant.)This high-rise hotel only had two elevators--so there was a line and a minimum 20 minute wait EVERY time we went in and out. Not only was the bed tiny, but the room itself was miniscule. The lamp on the left side of the bed was broken, and the desk lamp didn't work. So--smelly, tiny, and only one working lamp. No coffee maker, only one towel, and no ice in the ice machine on our floor (on any of the three nights we stayed.) All this from a ""luxury"" hotel. Oh, and they charge you an additional fee on top of your room rate to cover wifi and other amenities. And no, the additional fee is not optional.We waited for a couple of hours for the line at checkout to clear out, then stopped by the front desk again to try to resolve the we-were-promised-breakfast-vouchers-but-didn't-get-them problem, as well as to voice our concern again over the substandard room for which we were being charged upgraded rates. The desk clerk apologized for the vouchers, but only gave us one day's worth of breakfast vouchers instead of the three we were promised. She said that the manager would have to authorize the rest, but he wasn't available and we would have to come back. As it was close to midnight already, we said we'd come back the next morning.We asked again the next day, and again was told he wasn't available. We also asked if we could switch to better rooms, and the desk clerk said that this would be possible later, but that we would have to come back and clear it with the front desk manager. (We went out for the day, and when we got back in the late afternoon, there was another mile-long line at the front desk for check in. The same process repeated the next day. We never did get to speak to the manager.)After we got back from our trip, I wrote to the hotel management to tell them about all this and ask again for a partial refund on the room rate. After TWO WEEKS, I got a response thanking me for ""pointing out the ways they could improve their service"" and to try to regain our good opinion, Park Central offered me a ""special reduced rate of 30% off their regular prices"" for my next stay. Except I had also been getting spam from Park Central offering a 30% discount for online booking. Wow, Park Central--how great to offer your existing online discount as recompense for a job badly done!!Yes, the location is great--they are directly across the street from Carnegie Hall, and only a few blocks from Central Park in one direction and Times Square in the other...but there are other hotels in the immediate vicinity that actually know how to deliver a nice stay.

The room had only 2 glasses so I called for 2 more and they arrived within 10 minutes. A few minutes later Housekeeping called to make sure we got the glasses. Second, the room was standard size, perhaps about a foot narrower than most US standard rooms. It was up-to-date with a large flat screen HD TV and modern bathroom amenities. Our king-size room looked out on to 55th Street. Third, while there were several housekeeping carts in the hall, they were covered and not in the way. Fourth, we prepaid our hotel room as part of the Manhattan Club promotion and were not charged any extra fees. Finally, we were on the 8th floor which is serviced by 2 small elevators (which service floors 3-9).

Anyway, they then had no king rooms, but they did find us a queen accessible room and ordered a roll away ... so fair enough they sorted the problem.

Bell men are great and full of information. Front desk girls really do not want to be there, at least the bell men gave a good first impression as the ladies at check in did not. Rooms have min. amenities, when staying with more than 2 people you must ask for additional towels and cups. Mini fridges are offered free of charge if you request upon check in. Housekeeping keep the rooms clean. There is a little place in lobby for snacks. Downfall is that the rooms are extremely small. We expected small, but you can't even swirl around in the desk chair due to hitting the bed. Also, be careful of the view you have as looking at the wall is very closterfobic. The tv is too big for the size of room. There is no air conditioning in the hallways or elevator. Also, elevator is VERY small, max 8 people can fit, and there are only 2. There are many deli's close by for good food, Central Park, broadway, time square, and subway. If size of room doesn't matter, and believe me it is SMALL, then the location of this hotel is good. Also, rooms are not noise proof, can hear all hallway noise. We had no road noise as we were against a wall, don't them fool you, they call it a court yard. It is not, there is nothing green below. Other issue was that our toilet paper was not replenished when house keeping came in the morning. I called to request more in the evening as by this time of course with 4 people in the room for 2 days, it is out. When none arrived 30 min later I called again, and was asked if I could wait another 15 min...for toilet paper. By this time the kids want to sleep, so I had to schedule my ' delivery' for morning. So as of now, we have still not received any. Hoping the Kleenex will due for now. Overall for a 4 star hotel, I was disappointed.

My kids could see time square from the front door. My wife and I walked to Hell's kitchen for cocktails and several subway stations were close by. I would certainly recommend it to those who are not expecting the Ritz and need something close to the action..... BTW even though we were on the seventh floor me and my boys used the stairs often because the elevator was REALLY small.","Midlothian, Virginia",13,4.0

Check in is at 4 but we could not check in until later because the room wasn't ready. The check in staff were abrupt, bordering on rude.

We chose the hotel because it was one of the few we could find that looked good and offered two beds in the room. (We are sisters, not a couple!) Starting with the not so ugly, when we first arrived we were impressed by the ultra modern decor of the lobby though it is not one where you can hang out. It only had a few benches and no other seating which makes the lobby pretty unwelcoming. (The entire hotel had been recently redone.) Check-in was easy and we went to our room. Then, the bad began. There are only two small elevators handling an entire wing of the hotel so waits are long and the rides seem to take forever. Upon entering the room, my sister, who is a little ""smell"" sensitive noticed a disturbing odor (which I did not sense). She also noticed a lot of dirt and dustballs where the carpet met the floorboards and chipped paint below the window. We had been promised a great view with an upgrade but I don't consider the rooftop of buildings with giant AC units to be a great view. (Happily you can close the drapes!) And, you know how most hotels give you an array of small bottles of lotion, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, etc? Not the Park Central. There was one tiny bottle of lotion and one bar of soap. (To be fair, there are three large ""community"" bottles of product int he shower.) On top of all that, our AC was a little sluggish. We spoke to management and they offered us a change of rooms the next day. We decided against the change because the new room was on 17, we were on 9 and thought the elevator situation would be even worse on a higher floor. Unfortunately, housekeeping did not do our room because they thought we were moving (miscommunication.)! So after our first day in the city, we returned to a room in the same condition as when we left that morning. There was one more housekeeping issue when my bed was made with a sheet that had black stains on it. Now the good...the staff was very accommodating. They got the AC fixed, gave us more toiletries, resolved the housekeeping issues and gave us a break on our bill to compensate for the issues. And, by the way, the restaurant is very good but if you don't want to eat there (breakfast is a little hotel pricey), there are plenty of neighborhood delis. There is one other thing, if you are visiting NY to see shows, there is NO better location. So, despite my 3 star review, will I stay there again? Absolutely!","West Palm Beach, Florida",18,3.0

Booked a double bed room for family and was given options to upgrade on the website for a larger queen deluxe room which I opted for at an extra $75.00 per night. If this was the larger room, I would hate to see what the standard room size is because it was in my opinion tiny. There was pretty much no room for our luggage. It was very tight and minimal standard. The elevators were a disaster. I saw four elevators but for the whole stay only one or two worked making for extremely long lines and long wait times coming and going. We ended up waiting for the elevator going up to our 12th floor room and taking the stairs coming back down. This was very frustrating.The air conditioning I would have to say is a bad system. It is very loud and blows cold air so cannot set for an all night comfort level. If you leave your window open as an alternative for fresh air, the police and ambulance sirens are relentless all night long. Needless to say, no one slept well at all.The location however was fine. Close to the park and 5th Ave shopping if this is what you are coming for. It is also located right next to the subway line which is great but the subway was closed at this location for maintenance during our stay. Normally we stay in mid-town but we stayed here for a less busy and noisy location. I would not stay here again.

We arrived at 1.30am and waited at least 15 minutes before a member of staff checked us in. The staff were not welcoming, friendly or apologetic about our wait. Before we arrived at the hotel I had contacted them asking if they could recommend anywhere locally I could order a birthday cake for my sister, I received no response. The hotel then failed to notify me when the cake I arranged to be delivered had arrived. If it hadn't been for an email from UPS I believe this would have been lost by the luggage room who couldn't find the parcel when I arrived with my email notification. I had planned to nip down to the front desk to collect this surprise cake for my sister, and was sent to three different people before someone eventually helped me, this took over 25 minutes and as a result ruined my surprise. The same day, we used the concierge desk to book an excursion with equally poor service. The man who served us was extremely rude, not only did he answer the telephone while he was selling us tickets, he also picked up the phone and made calls to other guests about their dry cleaning. This may not have been so unacceptable if the man was capable of multi-tasking, however, he stopped serving us while he did these other tasks meaning we waited longer than necessary. On our final day we also asked the concierge if it was possible to book a taxi for our return journey to JFK. We were quoted $93 for a private taxi which was expensive considering yellow cabs advertise flat fares of $50. The concierge's response to this was that the $50 didn't include tolls or gratuity and that yellow cabs were unreliable. We therefore booked two private cars as advised. Later that day when we were leaving the doorman advised that if we'd booked a taxi through the hotel it would have only cost $60. We were confused by this because as far as we were concerned we'd booked through the hotel's concierge, it was only at this point we were told the concierge desk was not part of the hotel team. This is not communicated by the hotel staff at all and there are no signs. We felt totally ripped off. To make matters worse, our second car was 30 minutes later which was extremely stressful. The concierge also advised gratuity was included with our payment, which it was not and we weren't taken on any toll roads! Overall the hotel is extremely expensive for small rooms and although the location is good, the Park Central is let down by their unfriendly and inefficient team. This was our first trip to New York and we were extremely disappointed with this hotel. I would not recommend. ",,6,2.0

In this case I had my family with me and Kimpton only had King beds available for the past weekend. When I first arrived at the hotel approx 6:30 pm on Friday there was no valet available and when I asked the front desk their answer was ""just stand outside and look for the men dressed in black"", not let me get them for you. After checking in we realized the phone did not work. It was not fixed until Saturday evening, despite being reported several times...911 was my biggest concern if it was ever need for anything the phone wouldn't work. Also, there was a red/pink stain on the sheets in our bed...we called down (on my cell) and instead of offering to come up and fix they stated ""we clean all our sheets to the best of our ability and if there is a stain it has been cleaned and disinfected"". We left the sheet under the window the first night and slept without it...to our surprise it was placed back on the bed the next day despite my complaint. The next morning I had forgotten my shaver and my wife walked down (no phone) to the front desk and they told her to walk down to the pharmacy 2 blocks....again not the hotels fault I forgot my razor, but customer service. The concierge did redeem the poor service, by getting me a shaving kit after I called down (on my cell) they sent one up. My wife went to the front desk and not concierge, but the answer should not be different from person to person over a common request.Parking was $60 or 65 I cant remember and I accept it is NYC and that is the going rate. The part I was disappointed in was the first time we use the room phone was to call for parking as we were leaving at 9:15 am Sunday. It rang and rang, but never connected to valet...I called the front desk and was met with rudeness over why I calling them and they transferred me...again it rang without answer, I walked down to get the valet myself and the gentlemen out front was very apologetic when I told him what happened, he knew exactly which FDSR had helped me and said ""she has an attitude every day"" she is the same lady that checked me out.As someone who travels a lot and works 100% in hospitality industry I don't like to complain, but the consistency in which your FD lacks in customer service is a trend. Very disappointed in the level of service and although I didn't yell and scream over the problems, I was clear on my disappointed and the FDSR did nothing but tap her nails as I talked...No I don't ask for discounts or credits, but I do think feedback should be heard and this case I had a lot in 48 hours.

If this fee is mandatory why isn't it included in the room price? They told me if you book by internet it is already included. But if you book through a travel agent, it would depends if the agent repass this tax to the hotel. I think that they should make a better work regarding communication with agents. Because if you are a customer and you paid everything in advance to a travel agent in order to arrive to the hotel expecting to have nothing else to worry about, this is a bad surprise.

I gave him my credit card and that was it. My wife, daughter and I went up to our room room and went to sleep as we had an early morning flight home the next morning.

I asked to speak with a manager and was introduced to Tony C. Tony C. could not have cared less about me. I asked why I was not told about it when I checked in and he said it is because Priceline.com should have told me about it. I mentioned that I was not aware of the charge and he pulled out a binder that was already sitting on the front desk counter that had screenshots from Priceline, Hotwire and other online booking sites showing the super small fine print that ""Facilities fees may be extra"". Clearly people complain about this all the time which is why he had the pre-printed pages in the binder on the front desk. When I asked ""what is included in the Facilities Fee"", he indicated that it included items such as free internet, free luggage storage, free local calls, etc. Why was this not disclosed to me when I checked in that I was going to have to pay a mandatory $21.78 per night change and for that I get the above mentioned amenities? BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE BEING CHARGED A BOGUS $20+/NIGHT FEE. They try to hide it from you. I never used the internet, made any local charges or stored my bags. Most hotels give you the option to purchase internet per night and who uses hotel phones for local calls anymore?

My third grandchild to turn 12 is a baseball fan and he choose a baseball journey. In addition his mother was turning 40 this year, so we pulled out all the stops. My husband choose Park Central because of the location. He specifically choose a a corner room with windows on two sides for our daughter, grandson and son-in-law so that they would have a view of Time Square.Of course this room cost extra. What a mistake that was. Where to begin? We did not have dial tones on the phone in either of the two rooms we rented. We were able to make phone calls out. The air conditioning in the corner room would go to 65 and then click off. The room was hot and muggy and smelled of mold. The bathroom fixtures were coming off and there was mold behind each of the fixtures. My daughter had to stuff a wash rag down the bathtub drain to hold in the bath water (the plug did not work), Air conditioning in the hall way outside our room also was not working.One of the two elevators was not operable while we were there and there was often 12-15 people with all their luggage in line to get on the elevator. It took forever.We understand that things happen and machinery breaks down. What was most frustrating about this hotel was the lack of response that we received when we contacted them. They stationed a young employee in the lobby who dutifully wrote down the long list of complaints. No response. We then wrote two emails and did not receive a response from either of them. No word at all from customer service.The only good thing I have to say is that the linen was good. Avoid this place folks.

It has a sleeping area (very good mattress), a separate siting are with a huge TV, a small entrance hall with closet and a very large bathroom. Not all rooms are as big as this one. I have no idea if I was lucky, or if this is what most king rooms look like. As a tip, mine was 1157.It was really a pleasure to go back to the room after a day of work or running in the park, sit in the sofa, and watch a World Cup match.

All around the edges of the carpets were full of dust. I mean could housekeeping vacuum a little better with a smaller vacuum connector? It's just plain lazy to see that the carpet areas against the walls are dusty...gives you a sense that the rooms are just not that clean. The entire hotel which has 26 or 28 floors (I forget) has all but 2 elevators in which one of them was not working some of the time I was there.The lobby bathrooms near the bar were filthy and disgusting. I have never seen a lobby bathroom that gross...especially for a 4 star hotel.Lastly...please don't go to the bar...when my colleagues and I went there for a drink one of the nights...we all sat there and felt itchy. Perhaps not bed bugs but certainly a lot of dust mites.

Despite what we had read previously Reception check in went smoothly and the staff were very friendly and helpful. We did not like our first room as it overlooked a central courtyard that was full of air-conditioning units so we asked to move. I think it was Laura who handled our query and had us moved to a higher floor with a better outlook within about 10 minutes. Room decoration is very nice, modern and clean. Couple of little things like no loo brush or loo extractor. Our first night was a bit of a challenge as our air conditioning unit was so noisy and we had been up for 25 hours straight and wanted to get to sleep. We called down about 5 times and eventually a maintenance guy turned up. There was no hotel information guide in our room, if there had been we would not have had to make as many calls during our stay as the information would have been to hand. (in fact there was a book in my sons room) The air conditioning problem was just that the fan was up too high and was fixed very quickly, we could have done that yourself with an info book. One big tip is take a flashlight with you. It is impossible to see the safe deposit box numbers in the dark wardrobe, especially as the box is turned to the side. We had to keep moving the room light into the wardrobe. In my son's room they had a wall in wardrobe and their safe was in pitch blackness at the back so impossible to use. If you want a bath leave yourself plenty of time as it takes about 20 minutes to fill so we stuck with the showers. Lots of hot water though at any time.There are no shower hats provided just the shampoo, body lotion and body wash. Plus soap. The rail in the wardrobe is in danger of collapsing as there is no centre support, I called to warn them a couple of times. When the maintenance man came about our aircon on the first night he said the wardrobe doors had come off of the runners and said they were a bad design. We had not noticed. The TV is huge in the room and we had good wifi connection on the 9th floor but my son on the 6th could not connect. There are only 2 lifts. We were lucky and only had a couple of times with a long wait but at times on the ground floor we could see big queues with suitcases waiting for lifts. Also on the ground floor the reception lacks seats. In total only 4 benches so had to stand for quite a long time when we were checking out and waiting for our car. Plenty of room to put some more comfortable seating. As mentioned in other posts there is no fridge or kettle facilities in the room. The downstairs grab and go shop is great, nice coffee, lots of choice of pastries and snacks. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we had read it was expensive and instead went to the restaurant across the road everyday. This hotel is surrounded by restaurants, lovely steakhouse next door and an Italian which had nice food but awful service. On our last day one of the children was very sick and so we asked to stay on in the room until our car came at 3.30 They charge half a night rate for the 3.5 hours. The porters/bell men could do with better customer skills. In the 5 days we were there they never once said good morning or engaged us when we passed them, but perhaps that's New York. Locations wise this hotel is great. 5 minutes to walk to Central Park, 10 minutes walk to Times Square and 42nd Street. Dozens of restaurants and close to theatres. Overall we had a lovely time here.

When I complained all they said is that they don't take responsability from the concierge because it's a rented space. I am waiting for reimboursment for the inconvenient at least!

This hotel was a score!! I used Priceline to get a fantastic deal on this hotel and it was everything I hoped it would be, though I would hesitate to call it a 4-star hotel, as advertised. The lobby is gorgeous, and I know it sounds silly but it smelled so good, especially after walking in from 7th Ave on a hot summer's day!First, the positive: LOCATION!! Located a 5 minute walk to Central Park, an 8 minute walk to Times Square, with a subway stop that goes the length of the city down to Battery Park directly next door, I literally could not have asked for a better location. Oh, and the Carnegie Deli is about a 30 second walk away on the next block. Our room was quiet and clean, air conditioning worked beautifully, and the beds were probably some of the most comfortable hotel mattresses we've had the pleasure of sleeping on. The bathroom was big and bright. DH in particular was a huge fan of the rain shower head.Now for the negative: I was aware of it from the other reviews (thank you TA!), but the extra $20/day mandatory fee for wifi use and luggage holding is ridiculous. I have never before stayed at a hotel that had a mandatory wifi charge. Normally, if there's a usage fee, you request the password at check-in and pay from there. Oh, you also get a free drink, but only if you order a meal at their restaurant (we opted to explore NYC's other meal options). I wasn't told about the fee at check in, and I didn't bother arguing about it when they slipped our bill with it under my door at check-out. But be warned, there is a hidden fee. We tried to watch TV one night, but dish service was unavailable at that time. There are no coffee makers in the room, and there are only three TINY elevators servicing floors 1-9. Not sure about the rest of the floors as we were on the 9th. I would definitely stay here again, but I feel rack rate is a bit high for what this hotel offers.

Customer service was excellent, have already recommended the hotel to friends who will be travelling to New York soon. The location is great, you can go out at any time and feel safe. One day I had a very minor issue, and spoke to a lady called Elizabeth Cacovic, she was so helpful, understanding, warm, lovely and AMAZING at her job; the issue was quickly resolved, and on top I received complimentary breakfast as an outcome. I have never come across someone who is so willing and happy to help someone and make the most of their stay.

I was worried about bed bugs in NYC, but the rooms are newly remodeled with new mattresses and covers, so no issues. The rooms are well insulated - you can't hear plumbing noises or tvs from other rooms. However, sound does come quite clearly through the hallway door. There is no radio, docking station, or coffee maker. BUT there are plenty of outlets that you can have several electronic devices charging, even bedside so you can use your phone as an alarm/radio. All staff are very friendly, even the maids in the hallway! Park Central is very close to theaters, Central Park, subway, and hop on/hop off bus stops. I had a single king room, and there is no place to lounge and put your feet up except on the bed.

Although I didn't think the hotel would matter to me (I was in the big apple for the first time!!) it was great to come back every evening to a beautiful, clean & comfortable room. Our super king bed was THE most comfortable bed we've both ever slept in at 5'10 & 6,4 it's important we have a big spacious bed! Our room was cleaned, & given fresh towels & bed linen every day. Free wifi throughout all areas in the hotel including our room was an added bonus for looking up maps/restaurants/directions last minute.There's lots of reviews on here with complaints about the lifts (elevators!)- we didn't have ANY problems. Never having to wait more than 10-30 seconds, this was not an issue whatsoever. Staff all friendly, helpful & welcoming. We used the free luggage store both on our arrival & departure, & had wine & snacks at the bar too. Late check out of 12 allowed us to fit in some last minute shopping & a final visit to Central Park before returning to our room to pack & leave for home.

No need to book a room if all you want is some surcease from the bustle of 7th Avenue.Our first room was a disappointment, having an A/C unit that leaked and wet the carpeting. But we were immediately given a better room with visual access to the City that never sleeps. We reserved lunch for ourselves and our friends, and we were given a quiet table and allowed to stay as long as we wished over coffee and dessert. Total for four great lunches: only $163, sans gratuity.The Concierge took time to explain what's to be seen and done in the City, providing maps and instructions to landmarks. If you're in need of a cab, just call the doorman and he'll hail you a Yellow Cab. Yellow Cab fare to (or from) JFK is a flat $58, and it's worth it. We took cabs to the theater, as well. The cabs are metered and the drivers are good. The Concierge can also get you Broadway tickets, but if you want to be adventuresome, stroll up Seventh Avenue and find the half-price ticket booths. You'll have to stand in line, but you'll be among friends from all over the world. Not wanting to stand in line, we bought tickets for ""Jersey Boys"" (not to be missed) from a street hustler, bargaining him down from $75 per ticket to $62.50--and getting great seats.New York City is not inexpensive. I paid $4.75 for a small glass of orange juice at a great restaurant across the street from the Park Central. But you can also walk a couple of blocks from the hotel and get New York pizza for 99 cents a slice, as we did after ""Jersey Boys,"" taking our snack up to the room to eat while watching the Miami Heat win its basketball game.You can stay at the Carlyle for about twice the price as the Park Central. I've been to both and I believe that the latter gives you more bang for the buck.","Asheville, North Carolina",25,5.0

I suppose the answer is that they'd prefer that you buy a cup in the overpriced kiosk in the lobby. The Park Central has ""some"" coffeemakers that can be requested, but they apparently didn't have one for us.Anyway--the location just south of Central Park is excellent. Walking distance to Broadway, Radio City Music Hall (for our daughter's graduation ceremony from NYU!), to the Empire State Building, etc. The room was very clean, and well maintained for the two nights we were there. I thought it was spacious for a hotel room in NYC, and the beds were comfortable, with a great pillow assortment.Complaints? Well, the aforementioned lack of coffeemaker, and the water pressure in the shower was low.I used Priceline Express so I really can't comment on the value. We were there for a gorgeous spring weekend, and some of the rates I saw online for other hotels were appalling.

The only reason I knocked a half star was due to the wait time for the elevators for floors 1-9. I believe the hotel was at maximum occupancy for a local concert so the wait time was long at times.

This was not our first trip to Manhattan, but it was the first time we booked at this hotel. As is normal in NYC, the hotel room was small, but it was clean and kept that way throughout our 4 night stay. We had the towels replaced every day, the room was cleaned and made up every day and that means that our fun and enjoyment of the city wasn't impacted by a lousy hotel experience, so we were very happy with the room. The only complaint we had was the noise from the street. The first night we were there we actually thought there was a window open. There wasn't. To be fair, we were on the 4th floor, but we've stayed on lower floors in another hotel in Manhattan and never experienced this level of noise before. We could even hear the horses hooves on the pavement. That said, we were exhausted enough at the end of the day that the noise didn't impact our sleep, but if you are a light sleeper, maybe request a room higher up, or a room not facing the Avenue. The hotel has been recently refurbished and this shows. The carpets are new and the window treatments and wall coverings are new. The beds were comfortable, and there was no shortage of pillows, if that's important to you.Oh, one other minor complaint. The elevators were SMALL. Luckily this did not seem an issue, as in we didn't have to wait too long for one, but there was once (and only once) when we had to wait because there were too many people for the elevator that arrived. Over all, though, I'd recommend this hotel to friends and family. We did not try the bar or the restaurant.","St. John's, Canada",23,4.0

We were impressed by our room's chic style and size; by New York standards, it was a roomy room. The bed was incredibly comfortable. I will say that the lamps in the room, while very impressive in styling, didn't exactly make the room bright, so if that's what you look for, bright lighting, you won't be able to acheive it. But I did love the lamps and plan to buy a couple of the same style for my home. The elevators were fast enough for us, unlike other reviewers' experience. The wheels fell off our experience at 11:30 that night. After a long day of traveling we were tucked in and dozing when the guests next door returned to their room. Even over my white noise maker and my ohropax earplugs, I could hear every word the woman was saying to her husband, Eugene. They went on and on and on, until I, despairing of their settling down anytime soon, called the front desk. I requested that they come up and quiet the folks down. But 20 minutes later, ""Eugene"" this and ""Eugene"" that. Just as loud as before, but with the television on now. It was then 12:30am and my fantasy of getting up early to energetically explore the City was fading. I called down again, and the front desk phone rang and rang and rang. I hung up, called again. Rang and rang again. It was about 1am at this point. I dressed in something slightly presentable and dragged myself downstairs to the front desk, where I found a big guy in a Hotel uniform. He asked if he could help me and I replied that he could come with me and get these folks to shut up. He came up and was able to get them to quiet down, and about 1:30am I finally got to sleep. I know the City never sleeps, but sometimes visitors want to. Also, do hotel housekeepers even vacuum rooms anymore? I washed and styled my hair one morning and returned to find those same hairs on the black and grey carpet in the same place they had fallen that morning.

No information about NYC in the room, so come prepared with own information about sights, transportation, etc. Lobby and restaurant beautiful and welcoming, clean, quiet.

We had booked a Premier King room on a high floor (for light and noise proofing) and the room itself was perfectly fine. Newly decorated and everything working - so far - though carpets a bit grubby. Also, a good size for NY, with extremely comfortable bed. The room was serviced very well every day. No coffee/tea making facilities though and to 'pop' out for coffee when on the 18th floor, with dreadfully slow lifts, not good. Also, no mini bar, so you don't want to forget to take your water up with you - or, with the above-mentioned lift problems - you could lose the will to live!!The bad bits. SERVICE - or complete lack of it, coupled with rudeness and generally surly behaviour. As a first time visitor to NYC, I was completely taken aback!When we arrived, after a long flight on Saturday 3rd May at 6.45pm (Park Central - so you can check who was on Reception!), with our Booking Confirmation from Booking.com, we were told they had NO room. As seasoned travellers we were having none of that - so eventually were told there were no KING rooms. On further pressing and production of our paperwork, we were extremely grudgingly given a key to a room on the 5th Floor. We had specifically booked a high floor - in NY, 5th is definitely not high. With yet more persuasion (after the aforementioned long flight), we finally got a room on the 18th Floor. Very hard work, worst check-in ever, rudest staff I have ever come across - highly recommend a staff training course.Further rudeness in the bar area and general unhelpfulness throughout our stay. It seemed the hotel was chronically understaffed and the staff are NOT HAPPY! For 2 days there was remedial work on the airconditioning system.Our room keys stopped working halfway through the week and we were asked to produce identification (which was in our room, obviously) and then undergo extensive questioning to verify our identity. To get into our own room! No apology though for their shabby service.The lifts are a disaster...only two to service 18 floors. Slow and crowded. Had better experiences in Vietnam and Cambodia.Although this hotel has a newly glitzed Reception area, hairdryers (poor - either very, very slow or blows your head off) and ironing boards in the room this is BY NO MEANS A FOUR STAR HOTEL.Since the only thing to recommend this hotel is the location, I would look in this area but avoid this hotel.","East Sussex, UK",67,2.0

As in, it was never available, it was sold out when I made the booking, I was told; but no one ever picked a phone to let me know what was going on and to offer me an alternative. That is fairly shocking to me as a business owner, and a hint of managerial issues / lack of care for customers (i.e ""let people come in, and when they have no other choice, we'll let them know there's a problem so they don't cancel their reservation"")They re-booked me in a smaller room with two smaller beds, and handed me a coupon for breakfast and a drink at the bar.None of the person I spoke with, including a manager, really tried to answer my questions; they avoided them with generic answers. They kept interrupting me when I was trying to speak - probably the most frustrating and disrespectful part. I should have just left at this point, but unfortunately the context didn't allow me to - as they hoped.The hotel was relatively clean (although I did see food scraps in the elevators and corridors on a few occasions)There aren't enough elevators (only two elevators for floors 3-9), so they're constantly packed and you have to wait a while before you can go up / down.The room I was re-booked in was on the 8th floor, so we struggled to get good sleep due to the noise outside; apart from that, it was decent and clean.There is no room service, but there is a bar / restaurant downstairs. The bar was OK, serving good cocktails and local brews. Breakfast buffet was OK too (I wouldn't spend $35 on it though, knowing you can have great brunches minutes from the hotel).When we checked out, no one even asked how things went - another sign of a hotel that doesn't care too much about what customers think.I sent feedback but didn't get a response.So, while the place itself isn't terrible, my experience and the way it was handled certainly were, and I think the place is overpriced for what it has to offer.I won't stay here again for sure, and I'll have better hotels to recommend for any friends or relatives visiting the city.",France,36,3.0

The rooms are very nicely done and the mattress in our room was very new. We had glimpses of Carnegie Hall from the room which was nice. The toiletries from a local alchemy store were super cool and appreciated. Cons - small things but they all add up. Yes the checkin service was efficient but lacked soul as did the general staff peppered throughout the lobby area. So much so we didn't feel terribly welcome to even visit the lobby bar. The rooms are NYC small - that means a room and plenty of wall knocking. The TV size matched this. For a king size bed the TV also needed to be size graded up.

I agree completely wit another review that says it seems the hotel runs itself and management is 'whatever'. Upon arrival the staff was courteous but hurried and impersonal. There were 2 people only tending to a lne of people waiting, and we did not arrive at a busy moment, since I saw longer lines on other days. There were more personell spots but there were empty, which was recurrent even when the lines were full with big groups arriving.The rooms were clean and the location central, yes, but that is about all this hotel has going for it. That and an obsessive aromatherapy going on upon entrance to refreshen your senses everytime you come in from the street. Period.Cleaning staff met during the morning hours looked one over as a nuisance, instead of any sign of sympathy for paying the room (not cheap necessarily), which pays their wages. The room was provided for with 1 soap and 1 handlotion, and the lotion ran out after the second day, yet the staff did not replace with another at all. The towels were one day only re-hung, as opposed to having clean ones put in. There was no welcome anything (literature, flyer, hotel ammenities, description, city information, anything at all) on the room we stayed in. Very impersonal. My daughter got sick and I went to the front desk to see if there were any thermometers available, and was instructed to go to Duane Read two blocks down. For a parent travelling this means either exposing the child again to the cold weather which is ailing them or leaving the kid alone in the room. There was NO hint of empathy or any help offered at all when I mentioned this to the man at the front desk, which tops again on the we dont care impersonal attitude throughout the whole stay.This was further acentuated when I went to check out and there was a big line of people checking in. I approached the front desk with my bill in hand and asked a woman if I could ask her something when she had a second, since she was tending to a check in. She rebutted with a 'Cant you see I am with someone' to which I told her I was checking out. She called another woman who was tending to the long line of group check in, who in a very rude manner asked what was it that I wanted. I explained I was cheking out and wanted to make sure all was ok and had a doubt about a 'Facilities Charge' included. She explained that was a standard charge for facilities, gym, wifi and general facilities.This charge was NEVER explained or specified at check in. My rate had free WIFI, but alas!, it was not free at all, I was being charged for it at the end. When I explained this to her she made a quick math and said ""Well since you stayed 5 days that's about $20 something a day"". At this point I gave up, since there was no purpose in having any more talk with this woman and just wanted to leave the hotel.This morning I received a standard marketing email survey on how my stay was, and part of what I am posting here is my reply to them. What irony that they have all their marketing set up really well, but the real experience itself falls quite short of it all. Lack of management, sympathy, empathy and just basci common sense so customers like it, reccommend it, and return, none of which I will be doing.",,0,3.0

No fridge or minibar, but they did bring one, as well as a coffee maker, when I requested them.The phone has a button for room service which I pressed many times without connecting and then when I called Guest Response I was told the hotel doesn't even have Room Service!

The room was clean and the hotel itself is nice. However, it's as if no one works there and the hotel is a machine that runs itself. Housekeeping and the doormen were very nice, but everyone else was clueless. We put in a request online for a refrigerator at least 4 days before our arrival. We even called to confirm the request. We arrived at the hotel early in the morning, before 10 AM, and were assured that we'd have the refrigerator in our room by the time we returned in the evening from our full day's excursions. When we returned... no refrigerator. My husband called to request that one be brought up. They said they would bring one up shortly. It never arrived. Not once did anyone mention that they did not have a refrigerator available. To the contrary, we were constantly assured that we would receive one, yet we never did. Our room was warm for the entire 5 day, 4 night stay even though our air conditioning unit was set to auto and 65°. What's so strange is that the temperature outside was 45° to 60° the entire duration of our trip. Yet the room was very warm. Lastly, as I pulled out some tissue from the tissue box in the bathroom, a medium-sized black bug came out with it. It was alive and crawling. I have a videotape to prove it. We had a very busy itinerary, and rather than compromise our plans by moving to possibly an even warmer room, we chose to bear the warmth and throw away spoiled food. We mentioned all of these things to a hotel manager the night before our departure. She viewed the video of the bug, asked me to email it to her, and listened about the refrigerator and warm room. However, she showed little concern or desire to redeem the hotel's reputation. We certainly aren't needy, but I know about good customer service. If it were my hotel, and guests were paying over $400 a night, I would've shown good faith by at least offering a free breakfast as an apology for all the money lost in spoiled food. We, however, did find a solution by giving away several days worth of food to the homeless once we truly realized we were not going to get a refrigerator. Management really needs to step it tremendously because they solely are ruining what could be a great hotel. And I know how management loves to write redeeming rebuttals on this website, however, if they truly cared, it's something that should have been done face-to-face when I told them about the issues we were having.","Savannah, Georgia",57,3.0

At check-in my colleague mentioned that the special New York State tax form was faxed to the office in advance, to speed along the check out process later. The desk clerk said he couldn't fine it, and would we talk to him later. So, we had our secretary re-fax the same form, and this time it was received. No problems right? Wrong. The replacement clerk for one of us said, ""No problem!"", and was quite cheerful. The other clerk was definitely rude, and said she would have to talk to a manager since we were using our own credit cards for payment. She doubted our word that NYS doesn't give out corporate credit cards (as if), and insisted on photocopying our ID, business cards, basically wanting our first born. And then, since we left over the weekend, conveniently the business manager would have to handle to matter on Monday. Charmaine Warren said she would contact us with further information about our refund ($153 each) and she still has not done so. Not only is this illegal, but their attitudes were astonishingly rude.

There are 8 elevator shafts on the plan, each with a capacity of 8-10, but only two serve a group of floors like 3 to 9 which results in frequent waiting and long queues at check-in time (hint: don't check-in at 4pm if possible, wait until ~6pm).I was already planning to try another hotel next time as there are so many in this price range south of Central Park, but then I read on the invoice that they offer a hefty rebate on my next stay, more than enough to offset the only negative point, so I'll probably be back :)","Zurich, Switzerland",4,4.0

I'm glad I did. Service was great, the room was clean and spacious, and the location was ideal for what I wanted to experience. When I stay in New York, I like to move around the city and Park Central is real close to most of the major subway lines that run through Manhattan. It's only a couple blocks from Central Park and it was close to some place I wanted to eat at - Ma Peche and Betony.As I understand it, Park Central has recently undergone some renovations and updating. One morning there was a problem with the elevators and had to use the service elevators, but the issue was resolved by afternoon. There was no refrigerator or clock/radio in the room - which is a bit different. While it wasn't much of an issue while I was there, it didn't seem that the heat/ac was working in my room. If the weather was colder, it might have become an issue.In the end, I've added Park Central to the top of my list of places to stay when I visit New York.","Houston, Texas",59,4.0

This includes Central Park, Times Square, Fifth Avenue, Columbus Circle, Rockefeller Center, and all the shopping and sites that come with this area. It's also very convenient to the subway to head downtown and cabs are plentiful for whisking you back to the airport or other parts of the city. It's a big hotel popular with large tour groups. The lobby is huge and has a couple of different gathering locations. Check in was quick and the staff was very friendly. I asked for and received a high floor room. The corner king non-smoking was large by NY standards. Two big windows let in lots of light. A large credenza with drawers and ample desk space along with a large bench, a chair and ottoman , and two large side tables make up the furniture in the bedroom and there is still plenty of floor space left over. A large double closet had plenty of hangers, a luggage rack, extra pillow, and the usual amenities (iron, etc.) The bathroom is also large with ample counter space, great hot water, and a big shower. The hotel looks recently updated in a mid-century modern meets urban style. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Stylish without being particularly unique. This could be one of many hotels in this area as it isn't particularly clever in its design, but the location is what sets it apart. I have stayed in the nearby Parker Meredien and would rate this hotel equal in size, amenities, and comfort. However, this hotel is about $100 less per night than the Parker. If you don't mind big hotels and are looking for convenience and value in midtown, this is a great option.","Atlanta, Georgia",54,5.0

They appear to base their service on their perceived potential to gain tips. Rich looking older people and business types, they are all over.

We stayed two nights in a classic king room #655. If this hotel had recent renovations they are already tired looking. The room was so small and the furniture so oversized that it was uncomfortable to be two people in the same space. When you open the dresser drawers they hit the end of the bed so unpacking was awkward. No desk chair because it wouldn't fit it there was one. Clearly the designer needed to be told that one size does not fit all when it comes to hotel rooms. This was our second room - the first had a desk chair but no other chair to sit in. The first room also had a broken toilet seat and a broken bathtub drain - there were parts sitting in the tub. The only place to read a newspaper or do some work was by sitting on the bed. Apparently only two elevators serve the entire wing of the hotel where we were staying. We had to wait in a line to take an elevator to our room when returning in the evening. This hotel seems popular with large groups of tourists - particularly students.

I do not normally complain; however, I think that a few things should be addressed that were issues. The front desk receptionist are just a few of the first people who greet your customers as they walk into the hotel. We were visiting on a work trip and NONE of us felt very welcomed by your front desk at all. We anticipated being greeted with a smile; however, on this trip we were greeted with attitude. I believe if your staff doesn't like to help people, then maybe they should not be in customer service. Since your staff does not have name tags, I could not tell you who your staff member was who was rude to us. She was a younger Latino women possibly in her late 20's early 30's with dark brown hair and a tint of red. Let me explain to you our situation. We were on a work trip and reserved 4 hotel rooms for the staff. We were not assisted in the right manner as we all felt as if we were bothering your employee. We had an issue with checking in because we did not have our corporate card with us that our boss wanted us to use to pay for the room. We did not know that we had to have that card present during check in. Your employee faxed our corporate office assistant some paperwork to fill out in order for our hotels to be paid for. She left before our faxes even went through and didn't tell us she was leaving. We had been waiting for the paperwork to come through. We finally were checked in after about an hour wait. My co-workers and I were given our keys and we proceeded to our room. We tried to use the cards and they did not work. I had my co-worker wait outside of the room while I ran downstairs to ask the front desk why they didn't work. They reactivated the cards and I went back up to the room. We used the cards and finally they worked....HOWEVER....to our surprise we entered a room that was OCCUPIED already! HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN???We went back down to the front desk and again went to your rude employee who just said ""Sorry""....and gave us another room. If we were dishonest people we could have stolen all of the items that were left in array in that room...but we are NOT those kind of people. I would have been very angry if I were those patrons that had someone walk into their room without even knowing!!! What a horror it would have also been for us and the other patron if we had walked into that room and they were there. That would be extremely scary! I am very disappointed in the customer service that was provided, and was very upset with the hotel mix up of room. I will not recommend your hotel for our next stay.

We arrived a bit early and the front desk was accommodating in getting us a room before check-in. Our fairly large room was clearly recently renovated and had a clean yet comfortable modern style.The staff were all pleasant and ready to help, not that we needed much. Everything in the room was in good working order, had plenty of charging outlets, and had a comfortable bed. The only room issue was that the shower wall-mounted bottles of shampoo, body wash, etc. included an empty bottle of conditioner. Small issues: the elevators are very small and have an odd system where you press the floor you want on a screen by the elevator bank and it assigns you one of two elevators. The problem is that sometimes an empty elevator opens that you weren't assigned and you have to get in and wait for it to start moving before you're allowed to select your floor. Also, as of March 1, 2014 the hotel charges a $20 + tax facility fee per day that allows you to access the ""free"" wifi, luggage storage, unlimited local and domestic long distance calls, health club, and a free drink if you buy an entree in their restaurant.

The staff are extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating. The hotel itself is beautiful, and the rooms are modern and clean.

Also, if you are lucky, you may even get a room with a Times Square view! The hotel is located right beside the 57th Street subway stop, which has lines N, Q, R, and W. Many other lines are in a short walking distance as well. Carnegie Hall is DIRECTLY across the street and the hotel is right beside the famous Carnegie deli! Overall, it is the perfect hotel for a vacation to NYC, for newcomers, as well as Manhattan veterans! I always fly into Newark and take the Airtrain from Terminal B (Where porter airline always fly’s into) to Terminal C where I get on the New Jersey transit, which takes us directly to Penn Station in NYC (about 25 minutes). The total cost of the Airtrain and New Jersey Transit is approximately $6.00. From Penn Station I usually opt for a Taxi to my hotel instead of the Subway simply due to my desire to not lug my suitcase around on the busy subway any longer. I always fly into Newark because it is significantly cheaper than flying into JFK or LaGuardia (At least from Toronto), although flying into those two would eliminate the extra steps getting into the city.

They had a performance at Carnegie Hall. I was uniformly impressed with the level of service from the concierge (Susan), to the housekeepers, bellmen, and all of the other employees. Everyone was smiling and genuinely seemed to want to be helpful. The only place I received ""so-so"" service was in the lounge. I waited with two friends at least 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. It wasn't busy, and there were two hostesses at a stand in the back of the room who were engaged in a personal conversation the entire time. But we finally ordered our bottle of wine and had a pleasant time, The room was nice enough, somewhat modern (if a little cheap-looking), and it is already suffering from the effects of high turnover (scuffed walls, etc.). I had a room overlooking 7th Avenue, so the view was nice, especially when it decided to snow on our second day. The only real problem was the elevators. When they renovated, why couldn't they have invested a bit more in expanding them? For a hotel with over 25 floors, there are only TWO teeny-weeny little elevators, with a maximum capacity of six or seven people. Imagine hundreds of people attempting to check in or out (with luggage), or simply to go anywhere. It was a nightmare. Thankfully, we were on the 6th floor, so in desperation, we usually took the stairs. Not too bad going down, but it was quite a hike UP. But hotel guests shouldn't have to use stairs. There is another bank of elevators on the other side of each hallway, but conveniently ""off limits"" to hotel guests. Simply disgraceful. Also, the lobby-level ""market"" had very limited hours. I think it is only open in the mornings, but always seemed to be closed whenever I walked by. There are no vending facilities in the hotel, so in order to get anything - a beverage, a snack, etc. - we had to bundle up and venture out into the 15-degree weather. Granted there are lots of places very close to the property, including a Starbucks (always packed) and another coffee establishment. But the management needs to rethink their limited market hours. They are losing a LOT of revenue in Food & Beverage.But again, the real issue is the elevators. Even with the terrific location of the hotel, I would probably not stay here again because of them. If you MUST, stay here, request a low floor. Also request a room that faces the front of the hotel. My friends in the interior rooms could not get any cell phone service.

Let's talk about the good stuff. Great hotel, great service staff, great rooms, some of the front desk people were very helpful, no complaints! But, some certainly need some serious attitude-adjusting in regard to taking care of the clients. Upon arrival, there was an issue with my credit card for my 4 night stay. After much ado, they were able to get payment for one evening. I assured them I would look into the matter and report back the next day with payment from that card, or other payment source. Upon checking with the front desk the second day, I was told by a front desk person (Cheree) that everything was OK and that my stay would be uninterrupted with future issues of this matter. In the mean time, I was checking to see what the issues were with my credit card. A quick call to the card service to let them know I was in NYC assured that I would have no future card issues at the hotel. So, I have two positive steps taken. Wanting to cover all my bases, I checked my on-line statement, only to find that the hotel had put a hold on my card in the amount of nearly $3000 for a 4 night stay that cost just over a thousand dollars. My room was nice, but if I'm being charged nearly $3000...gonna' need a SERIOUS upgrade! Bringing this to the front desk's attention, (again, Cheree was very helpful) she told me should would contact their finance department and see why such a large amount had been held. ( I realize that hotels will hold a few extra dollars for incidental issues. Ok, I admit, I dropped and broke one of the water glasses in the room...so BILL ME!) Again, I was assured that everything was all right. Well, it was until returning to my room on Sunday night/Monday morning. My key would not open my room. Heading back down to the front desk for another key card, I was told they hotel was experiencing key card issues, apologized and sent me on my way with a new card. It, too, was found to not work. Making a second trip back to the front desk, I was told that there was an issue with my credit card. (I'm sure there was...they had initially put a hold on $2800 on the card!) The night manager said there was nothing he could/would do until proper payment was received. For the next two hours I was left to sit in the front lobby until some of my other friends returned from their night out. In what was a very awkward and embarrassing moment, I had to ask one of them to ""cover my charges"" so I could get back in my room. After 3 hours, I was allowed to go back to my room...after their daily reports were printed and the computers would allow them to make me a new key card. Have since received a credit card statement showing nearly $1500 available credit on the card. Yet, checking the card on-line TODAY, the hotel is still holding nearly $400 in funds against the card. So, my advice, it's a great place to stay, but have a credit card that has 5 to10 thousand dollars of available credit, as the hotel will be ""holding"" a big chunk of it. Not impressed.

The room was clean, but very small - about the size of a cruise-ship economy cabin. The furnishings were quality.

The lighting was somewhat dim.The local fire station must be close by, because sirens were common and very loud throughout the night - even on the 10th floor.Check-out is supposed to be at noon, but when we returned from a shopping trip at 11:25 AM to check out, our card keys had already been neutralized, and it took 20 minutes to get a security person to let us in to collect our luggage.

Over the course of a two day stay, my impression has definitely worsened.If you want to take a nap during the day or get a good night's rest, forget it. It's not because of the outside noise--rather, hotel staff stomps through at all hours of the day and night. The walls are so thin you can hear entire conversations. I just want to sleep, not hear about laundry statuses. Also, on my first night, the someone from the hotel banged on some poor girl's door for a really long time at 5:40 in the morning. That woke me up plus her until she asks them to stop. Why can't they use a phone like normal people?The front desk staff was not very accommodating at all. I had to extend my stay due to the snowstorm and they were unhelpful. Instead, I booked another hotel and the experience has been many times better.

The hotel lobby keeps a lot of traffic. It's not very big, so any ""group"" that gathers tends to take up all the space.

My stay was absolutely wonderful as she saw that every single detail was perfect. What a wonderful representation of this hotel to have someone like Elizabeth that truly cares about the guest! She says that she wants to make sure that every guest is 100% satisfied with their stay and she ensures that happens.The location of this hotel is convenient to everything.The subway(N-R-Q) is literally steps away. It is close to Central Park and many other attractions. Since our last stay here the rooms have been 100% renovated as has the hotel restaurant (Park Kitchen) and the bar & Lounge area. It is clean, comfortable & affordable.   It was a pleasure to return to this hotel and see all the wonderful changes and find that Elizabeth is still there attending to every detail as always. She is truly a great first and last impression of this establishment and the main reason we continue to return.

You are steps away from a 57th Street subway station (N, Q, R), a block from Central Park, 4 Blocks to Broadway, a few blocks to Radio City and Rockefeller Center, etc!It`s unacceptable for a hotel like this (4 stars) not to have free Wi Fi, not even in the lobby! You just have 3 Ipads with internet connection, that aren't enough for the amount of guests that the hotel can accommodate. You have a Starbucks next to the hotel, but I went to Tisserie or Premier Deli Café, just a few steps from the front door of the hotel, both of them were great and had free wi fi!The hotel is nice, recently renovated. The rooms are ok, and in general the service from the hotel staff is good, especially the bell service guys, and the brunette concierge (I can’t remember her name) that was extremely helpful with a problem we had with the airline and our luggage, she was really nice with us the whole trip with everything we needed! We had some issues as we arrived to the front desk were the old lady with curly blond hair that was supposed to assist us, wasn’t helpful at all; She said she didn’t speak Spanish, but we heard her communicate with other member of the hotel staff in Spanish; She also wanted us to pay in advanced, to which we refused, and she told us we couldn't get our room until we paid (it was early anyways, so we said we will wait), she had a really bad attitude and really rude, looks like she really hates her job, and the truth is she doesn't fit in that position. Later when we return in order to get our room, a man help us in the front desk, he was helpful, he told us we had to pay when we check out (as in almost every other hotel!, except from the ones you pay in advance) As the days went by we got to talk to another guests in the hotel, two of them had similar problems with the same lady.","Buenos Aires, Argentina",58,4.0

The elevator system was our only complaint.....waited more than 10 minutes each time that we wanted to go back to our room......this needs to be improved greatly.

I have been traveling to NYC on business on and off for the last couple if years and I like trying out different hotels based on availability and pricing. This week I stayed here and had a lovely experience. Granted, I only spent around 8 hours total at the property, so I may not have had the full experience.I checked in a little late since I came straight here after some travel. The check in process, even at 11pm, was smooth and efficient. There was a line and only one person at the front desk but quickly a manager came and helped remedy that situation. The room was decently sized for NYC and nicely updated. I didn't turn on the TV but it looked like a nice sized flat screen.The bathroom is a little on the smaller size but I have seems smaller in NYC. The fitness center / gym is truly the best part of this property. Plenty of cardio machines (all looked very new) and lots of space. This is something very rare for a hotel in the city. Normally it's a closet with 1-2 treadmills and maybe one bench. This place had several cardio machines, 3 benches, and lots of room for yoga mats. The fitness center alone makes this place a new spot for me to stay when I am in NYC.I didn't need the wifi so the fact that they charged didn't bother me but that would be the only amenity I think this hotel needs to become a very highly rated spot on this site.All in all a great hotel.","Dallas, Texas",67,4.0

Hotel loses business with this policy.Also bathrooms lack fans (does building code allow this? Not where I live) and shower curtains barely graze the top of the tub.

We found the front desk staff kind of unfriendly in particular one girl that was rude everytime we had to deal with her. When a request was made to borrow a corkscrew to open a bottle in our room as well as some wine glasses this was not given. We had to go out to try and find some to buy. Another time I asked to buy a bottle of water and was told they had no bottled water in the hotel. The restaurant is very expensive so I would recommend going to one of the delis out of the hotel.The Premier Deli and the Carnegie Deli are just out of the building and less that 1/2 a block from the front door. Subway is also across the street and it is open 24 hours. The hotel was having a lot of trouble with the elevators. We waited sometimes 10-15 minutes for elevators. They are set up strangely with one bank of elevators on one side of the hotel and the other on the opposite side. One bank of 2 elevators goes to only some of the floors and the other bank goes to some other floors. weird set up. There are not enough elevators for the amount of rooms in the hotel. There is also a large discrepancy in the sizes of rooms and bathrooms. Our room was very small as well as our bathroom but one of the other guests in our party had a large room. We both paid the same price. Didn't seem quite fair. The hotel is in a really excellent location. Easy to get to Carnegie Hall and within walking distance to Times Square.
