Booked directly through the website and had no issues--all questions were promptly answered, etc. Bed was comfortable and loved the tub in the bathroom (Deluxe Queen). Not much sound proofing on rooms--easy to hear what was happening next door and in the hallway. Toilet was in a separate room, which was nice, but the close quarters of the room still made it slightly awkward for a romantic couple weekend. Only things we'd change is the music in the public spaces was overbearing and less-than-ideal (""Greatest Hits of the 70s and 80s"" type stuff) and the downstairs bar/coffee shop service left something to be desired--had to ask for change, difficulties getting attention of the servers, etc.",,0,4.0

This was my first time not booking directly with a hotel and it did not go well. All my confirmations showed I booked a Corner Room but The Standard only had records for a regular room. I know there are worse things in life but I felt my experience at the front desk was less than desirable. I flew all the way across the country and just go out of a cab and the front desk/management really failed on an opportunity to have a customer for life. They even reviewed my Capital One confirmation and verbally acknowledged they had plenty of those rooms available. All they could do was suggest I go up to the room they provided and call Capital One. Then if I got it straightened out, I could haul all my stuff back down, talk to them again for an hour and get a new room. The Standard either does not empower their employees to assist or really does not care to help. I know the screw up is 99% on Capital One but The Standard really bamboozled an opportunity to show superior customer service. Overall it was just awkward working with them and NO I would not book with them again!","Madison, Wisconsin",1,2.0

We love the location and enjoyed daily walks in the high line park. Super close to Whitney Museum, walkable. Lots of great restaurants, stores etc and not busy like other parts of the city, yet very close to everything. Hotel is very hip and has an ice skating rink as well as a few restaurants and awesome rooftop bar. Water views from our room was from the side but the floor to ceiling widows are great.The only thing I would change about the room is the bathroom situation. There is really no privacy when showering, the bathroom has no door and there are shutters that block between the tub and sleeping area. But even with the shutters closed, if you are on the bed or basically most anywhere in the room, you can see into the shower. This was not a problem since I was with close family members. Not sure I would want to bare all in other situations. Toilet was in it's own closed room, which was great.","Greenville, Delaware",2,4.0

I looked at a TON of hotels, read about a million reviews and weighed all of our options.I picked The Standard, High Line because so many of the reviews raved about the hospitality and how the Manager went out of their way to make sure guests had a memorable experience. I read glowing reviews about birthdays, weddings, honeymoons and booked the hotel based on those experiences.It was my husband's 40th birthday. We paid for a corner king suite and called the hotel a few weeks before to ask for a room on an upper level because it was a special trip and I wanted a nice room. We arrived and there was no note in the file, and they put us in a room on a lower floor. They had empty larger suites on higher floors, but they did not offer a complimentary upgrade. The Manager said that they cannot accommodate room requests, but if they would have told me that in advance, I could have chosen a different hotel. Also, the reason why you make a request weeks in advance, is so the hotel has the opportunity to accommodate in advance. I could have made a stink, complained more, etc., but it was my husband's birthday and I didn't want to ruin it even more. They moved us 2 floors up after one night, but we still were not on an upper floor. The Manager sent us a bottle of champagne to appease us, but my husband doesn't drink. They didn't even ask. My husband wanted a nice room, not a bottle of something he cannot drink. :(We constantly had issues with billing, with housekeeping and front desk staff who were nice but not knowledgeable about the property. You pay a $30 facilities fee to use the gym, for gym laundry (that they didn't tell us about on check in) and bike rentals that you are seasonal so you cannot use them (even though it was warm). The facilities fee is pretty ridiculous given that you're already paying quite a lot for the room. But The Standard Bar and Grill staff were absolutely amazing. The Grill Manager was perfection and all the waitstaff, bartenders were truly wonderful. It is a shame that the hotel staff didn't have the same level of hospitality, particularly at the high price point. I should note that we paid $500 a night for 4 nights. Thats not cheap and I had hoped that we would have gotten better service at that rate. It was disappointing.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",0,3.0

I've been back 3 times since, and am going to the post office today in order to have my mail forwarded there. It seems a shame that I'm only now discovering it given how beautiful this room is. It must be one of the most sophisticated venues in the entire city. The views are spectacular, the decor is elegant in the most timeless way, the waitstaff is gorgeous (and very friendly), and most importantly, the vibe is perfect. You would think that there would be a tremendous amount of pretense among the staff and patrons in a place like this, but that hasn't been my experience. Everyone was very friendly, there was a lot of interaction between different groups and parties in the room, and the staff are an important part of the social experience. I highly recommend visiting the BBR to anyone visiting, but also to New Yorkers who are looking for an elevated night out. This is definitely the sort of place you would want to take a date to demonstrate that you have outstanding taste. If you go once before, it is likely that the waitstaff and management will remember you and give you a warm welcome. Such was my experience.

I can’t thank the staff enough for all the hospitality and our room upgrade for a King suite ❤  Maaaaaaaany thanks and shout-out to Lilly, our concierge and person in charge of getting us the best anniversary complements I could have asked for. She was flawless upon handling and arranging everything upfront and during our stay. She was super responsive to all requests and emails. I also owe a debt (LOL) to Sam and Ana for getting us room upgrades for such a special occasion and for such an express and friendly check-in! Mark took care of our luggage and made sure to make us comfortable all the way to (and getting inside) our room! Last but not least, Nico made sure we had a superfast and easy check-out with appropriate clarifications in connection with billing and made us super comfortable with luggage drop and storage for a few hours before we left.Would definitely recommend The Standard to friends and family, in particular to couples and parents travelling with their kids.

However, my last visit, from 1/14-1/16 is making me reconsider the Maritime, the Gansevoort and the Dream. The simple reason is that when I entered my room late on Thursday evening, I was greeted with a giant cockroach (hard to tell scale in the picture). I was lucky enough to be able to stomp on him before he got away, but, as you might imagine, it was impossible to fall sleep, knowing his friends and family might be lurking nearby.

Conveniently located right next to the High Line which is a great outdoor walking/viewing experience in the city. High end shopping and dining within walking distance. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful from the bellman, concierge, bouncers, bartenders, housekeeping etc. Any questions we had or requests they fulfilled very promptly. The hotel is located in a great location walkable to subways, restaurants, stores. The hotel itself could use some upgrades. First being the lighting in the rooms. Where the light switches were located. The bathroom, although large was not as enjoyable as it could be for its size. The toilet was in its own small room accessible through the vanity/closet area. The walk-in shower was across the entrance way with no door (the hall carpet got wet every time we showered). The tiles in the shower floor, ceiling and walls were shiny black and the lighting consisted of a very dim night light providing minimal sight while showering. Inside the shower was a huge rectangular tub too deep to sit comfortably in. (The water as not clear when I tried to fill it. Probably because no one has used it because if it’s awkward size.)The room was a modern/contemporary design but slightly worn. There was no dresser for clothes other than 3-4 small cubbies in the closet in the bathroom. The closet had a curtain because it was too small of an area for doors. There was room to hang some pieces of clothing. There was an L-shaped seating area with a table attached to the floor that had a swivel to help you get in and out of the seating area. The TV was mounted on a metal post out of the floor directly in front of the floor to ceiling window. (That could be mounted on a wall that was a full mirror). The window curtains could be closed for privacy and recommended when dressing as it is clear view from other buildings/street below. The Standard Hotel clearly gets 5 stars for location and city views. 5 stars for hotel staff. 3 stars for the price and overall decor/comfort of the room. They do need to update and possibly reconfigure the space in the room to be more user friendly and allow for unpacking of suitcases. Averaging it out- this is why I gave 4 out of 5 rating.

I'd note the reception was quite cosy with a number of people waiting around, I presume on departure.The room was as expected - on the small side but it is New York after all. If you're travelling with a lot of luggage, be prepared to be stepping over it constantly, or book a larger room. The bed was decent but lower to the floor than I'd like and the pillows could be better. I still slept well though. The shower has a glass side to the room - some people may not like that. There's also no door to the bathroom and the WC door didn't close well. Overall, the room was quite tired and I'd consider it time for renovation - taps dripping and cupboard doors dropping.There's no iron or ironing board in the room but you can have one delivered by housekeeping. The gym on the 17th floor is open 24/7. It's a great space and early mornings I had it to myself and got to enjoy watching the sun come up. The hotel will also launder four items of clothing a day for free - you pick up a wash bag exiting the gym and it will be returned to your room later that day - those kind of unexpected things are a real difference.We had dinner one night at The Standard Grill. This was really the only real disappointment - the service was more frosty than friendly and meals somewhat average for the price. Our stay in New York was jam packed so we didn't get time to visit the rooftop bars.Overall it was a good stay and I needed to be in the Meatpacking district I'd visit again.","Sydney, Australia",194,4.0

Off to the side was a forest of heaters and deck chairs where people snuggled up with blankets and drank hot cocoa. Inside was a small, stylish reception area with couches and a few concierge stands at the rear. Nobody was there. But by the time I got there, out from behind the curtain emerged the front desk agent - ""The Man"" - Gianni. He kindly took my information, then when I mentioned to Gianni that my wife and I were celebrating our one-year anniversary, he was genuinely congratulatory and wasted no time making our experience as special as possible. VERY special. I didn't expect such generous accommodations, but he managed to facilitate one of the nicer rooms in the hotel for us. Thanks Gianni!Otherwise, we had technical difficulties in our room and they immediately sent an engineer who very quickly and discretely fixed the problem. The views from our room were incredible! Definitely check out the bar on the top floor too, but be sure to make a reservation (we went up to see the sunset but couldn't sit at any of the stadium seating booths because we didn't have one). All in all a fantastic stay! Even the bluetooth speaker was a nice touch, and the sound separation between rooms was good.

Unfortunately, it was quite the disappointment overall. The two things I would cite are: The room seemed a bit ‘tired,’ things seem a little old and outdated, which is quite the contrast with all the color-coded PR materials. Second, the noise from the nightclub was unbearable and I had to switch rooms in the middle of the night. I was ‘upgraded’ to this room with the understanding that the club was closed, but it was clearly not. I give credit to the gentleman on the phone who arranged the move, however, who was unfailingly polite and understanding. On the other hand, I was not originally offered anything for this huge inconvenience but after I mentioned it, I was given a breakfast credit, which was better than nothing, though I think I should have been offered something more (discount on my room? A future stay?). One more thing: The view (thanks to the ‘upgrade’) was beautiful but the windows were so dirty that everyone I sent pictures to commented on that!","New York City, New York",3,2.0

Breakfast was excellent with all the usual stuff- Breakfast Sandwich, Pancakes, a very tasty Croquet Madam, Avacado Toast (YUM!), Hot Chocolate and a Stella! Full bar too. Interestingly, the floor is covered in US Pennys. We asked how many, and the waiter said 450,000! Wow that’s a lot of penny’s. Restrooms are downstairs and are cool in that there is a joint sink area for men and women which was a bit unusual and scared my young granddaughters. Toilets of course are separate. I guess by NYC standards pricing is typical but for our group of 8 our brunch tab came to $211.00 with tip. Would check out a different less expensive restaurant next time as there are many nearby. Nothing against The Standard. Good place.","Vernon, New Jersey",57,4.0

Needless to say, we had a spectacular time in NYC and loved staying at The Standard - High Line. Upon arriving, we were immediately greeted by Ana, David Z and Melinda at the front desk. All of them couldn’t be more hospitable and accommodating. In particular, we arrived hours before the regular 3pm check-in and they surprisingly were able to get us into our rooms so that we could clean up and head out for the day. Talk about a great start to the vacation! Then they were even able to secure the room for our boys that were arriving the day after next. We were quite pleased with both rooms, which had great views of the city and Hudson River. The only drawback to the rooms were the showers, which were lacking in light and (um) privacy. They certainly had a euro flair, so I’d recommend asking for a shower curtain when you check-in as well as showering during daylight hours. Aside from that, we didn’t have ant issues with the rooms. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were relatively spacious for NYC. Subsequently, the rest of the hotel was hip and fun for all ages and walks of life. The ice skating rink in front of the hotel was entertaining, especially for the little ones. And the beer garden with ping pong and picnic tables was perfect for socializing. Regarding location, I am so happy we decided to stay in Chelsea/ the meatpacking district than midtown. Other than the Chelsea Market that is a block away from the hotel, the area is way less crowded and the location is perfectly situated in proximity to SoHo and lower Manhattan. Also, midtown is a quick train, bus or taxi ride away. I believe I covered all the high points. If you choose this hotel, I hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did ","Chicago, Illinois",0,5.0

We went upstairs, the sheets weren’t tucked in and there was a hair on the bed. We went downstairs and they immediately moved our room. Didn’t offer an upgrade, just moved us to a similar room. What we found in this room was disgusting. The toilet was filled with urine. The bathroom was obviously not cleaned. Went downstairs again, they said while we were out for dinner it would be cleaned. Two hours later we return and go to our room, it still has not been cleaned. We went back downstairs and were moved for the third time. While we were granted credits and freebies, the fact that two rooms were unsanitary is beyond unbelievable. Paying $250+ for a night is crazy for it to be dirty.

And the service is very poor, also the basic one. Two concrete examples:1) we called tha concierge to book a table for lunch at Ladurée on Madison Avenue. Ffew minutes later the concierge calls: ""you are all set"". At our arrival at Ladurée we discover they don't take reservations.

The view does NOT disappoint, especially as the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. of course rooms are very small as its NYC. I ate at all of their restaurants. I was disappointed in their steakhouse but one was because the server was rude, she was an older Asian woman that maybe hates customers? Or trying to be the rude NYC person? odd for an expensive dining experience. The other problem I had was with dinner portion which was very small. Other than that I loved the ambiance of the room. I loved the quality of my meal. I also ate at the bistro, breakfast, and it was very good but not great. again, really awesome ambiance, a really cool place. As for the Biergarden this was also a really cool place, great ambiance, and with great employees. I loved the open air setting and laid back vibe. One great thing about this hotel is the location is close to other great restaurants. The high line is awesome in my opinion and we actually walked the full length, twice, as I had a conference at the Javits. Seems to be the new destination to live in NYC though so I feel it will get overun; already very crowded.

From the moment I came out of the cab I tripped coming off the curb but luckily one of the bellman was right there to catch me and greeted me with the most amazing smile. Hands down one of the best looking bellman I’ve ever seen and if you come to this hotel, make sure to ask for Kosta. He proceeded with helping with my carry on and eventually arrived at the front desk. I later came down and found Kosta outside and asked him for recommendations for dinner and drinks. I must say at one point I thought he was the concierge because he was extremely knowledgeable with many different recommendations, I ended up having an amazing dinner at the Standard Grill restaurant which is part of the hotel and finished off my night with a cocktail at Tao which I thank the other bell man Mario for the great recommendation which was only a short walking distance away from the hotel. Overall the room I stayed in had an amazing view of the river and the skyline of downtown, which is absolutely breath taking in the evening. Upon departure there was yet another bellman to help me into a cab. Thank you for the wonderful experience and I will definitely be back again.","Astoria, New York",2,5.0

We had a Deluxe king room at $600 a night. The hotel has a great, young, chic vibe and I understand why people feel at home here. The location is great and you are right at the Highline. Our room on the 5th floor had Hudson River views but the design of the room was annoying. First of all why obscure the view and put a huge flat screen tv in the middle of the floor to ceiling window. It not only obscured the river view but it obscured the view from the table too. And it is so low your blankets obscured the remote control sensor since the bed is also one foot off the ground. The light in the shower was a tiny puck light very insufficient. There were no hooks to hang towels anywhere except two in the shower over the hot tub. Come on people where do we hang hand towels?? You’re forced to put them on the floor. Management has no concern for conserving water and energy by re-using towels and be a little eco friendly either. Come into the 21st century. We need to conserve resources. Please put a couple hooks up to hang towels - that’s just unacceptable. While design and form are nice, it is useless and annoying not to consider function.

Now the rave…we were staying at the Standard because we were getting married in the 3rd floor event space overlooking the Hudson River (on one side) and the Highline (on the other). The space itself is FANTASTIC and has both indoor and outdoor areas which are both exceptional. We couldn’t have been happier (and luckier weather-wise) with how the event went and our “special day!” was made even more special by the Space, the Standard Highline AND the staff. So many people to mention but we’ll only discuss a few. First, ALEXANDRA REISS! Alex was our event planner at the Standard (official title is “Senior Sales Manager, Special Events “) and from the very first time we met (before even deciding on the Standard for our wedding), we knew we were in good hands. Not only did Alex understand everything we needed/wanted but she was amenable to all of our requests and had the added value of including things we hadn’t even considered to make our day even more special. Every subsequent meeting/planning session continued in this vein. Simply put, we can’t imagine our wedding going so well without her. She is an exception planner, organizer AND a wonderful person and we feel so lucky to have worked with her for one of the most momentous days in either of our lives. On the day of the event, the “Captain”, Joe, was also fantastic and made certain that all of our requests (both in advance AND day-of) were handed without a hitch (as well as the Champagne and treats set up in our suite (an unexpected upgrade!) as we prepared for the ceremony and somehow all of the gifts being taken up to our room before the end of the evening – just unexpected treatment that was most appreciated). We also were lucky enough to have Samantha as our “shadow” for the event and there wasn’t a moment all day/night (including coming to get us in the room BEFORE the ceremony) that we wanted for anything – she was, again, yet another person taking the extra effort to make the entire event special. All of our guests (including some very picky people) had a wonderful time and every single person who worked the event (from Joe, the “Captain”, to each waiter (Kristina (?) and others) to each bartender) made certain to treat every person attending (and not just us) as if they were the most important people there. AND, the food was incredible and no one went without the entire evening (we did not do a sit-down dinner but 18 passed hors d'oeuvres – 6 light, 6 heavier and 6 desserts – over several hours) – and every single one was unique, beautiful and outstanding. In short, we cannot recommend the Standard Highline (and event space) more to anyone and if you are considering a wedding or event, we HIGHLY recommend due to the quality, professionalism as well as space and staff that takes it way over the top in terms of events in NYC. Thank you to Alexandra, Joe, Samantha and ALL for the wonderful day and memory that will last a lifetime! - J & 0 - NYC","New York City, New York",2,5.0

Definitely high on “cool factor.”TOO MANY CONS --1. Bed was only 12” off floor. Shoved flush to wall on one side, so you had to climb up from foot. Bed too low for comfortable sitting. Soft saggy mattress gave me back aches. Front Desk offered no solution. I had to put a pillow behind my back to not roll to center of our king bed.2. No place to put my CPAP by other bedside. Small night stand only held telephone. Drug small table from across room to do CPAP.3. No place to put luggage or clothes except on the table. 4. Bench by table not great for sitting. So basically no place to sit comfortably in room5 DANGEROUS -- Soaking tub/shower LOOKED great. Very deep and cool looking.BUT it’s about an 18” or more to step from bathroom into tub. No grab bar to help. Slippery tub floor makes this hazardous.6. NO PRIVACY -- The wall next to shower is a clear glass window. No curtain, so you are naked to anyone else in the room, and unless you close the blackout curtains, you are naked to the high rise across the street. While the shower glass was a bit sexy for my wife and I, it would not be good for two roommates, or mother and daughter -- or worse -- a father and daughter on a college visit. So unless you are comfortable showering in from of your roommate, don't stay here.7. NO SPACE -- Closet did offer shelves for clothes but very limited space and about 10 inches of hanging bar.8. NO TOWEL BARS, just a tiny hook.9. OVERPRICED FOR VALUE -- My bill for our 5 Night stay was $2,800 with no food billS -- just internet, room, and a few mini bar charges.10. BAD SERVICE -- We would have had more mini bar bills -- but they never restocked it — even after 3 requests, including two people coming to check the mini bar.SUMMARY -- So we paid $560 PER NIGHT for a crappy bed, dangerous tub, and the $195 I’ll pay a masseuse to fix my aching back tomorrow in Chicago.I’m not a rookie traveler at 72. I am certainly able bodied, so I did not order a handicap access room. But this 12” high bed and 18” high tub and no place to sit or store clothes makes this the WORST hotel stay in over 50 years of travel.Bill Note: Lots of younger folks might find all this stuff quirky, cool, and fun -- that is --unless they stayed on a higher floor where many reviewers complained about the noise from the public club until 2am each night. We were on the 11th floor and did NOT hear any noise.Stayed in: Superior King Room on 11th floor with city High Line view.",,0,1.0

The hotel is beautiful, and was close to my office, but it did feel a bit impractical as a business traveler for more than a few days. For instance, there was no dresser in my room to unpack clothes, only two short closet rods that ran perpendicular to the wall, with only about four hangers, as well as no iron or ironing board. I imagine the hotel would provide hangers and perhaps an iron and board upon request, but I'm not sure where it would have gone in the room. I'm not too keen to live out of my suitcase for more than a night or two, so something to consider if you're like me.(I realize I probably could have seen those details when looking at photos online, but I didn't think to look for it.)The bed was very comfortable, and the shower and bath were excellent. Loved the bathrobes, too, and I was delightfully surprised at how quiet the hotel (and outside) were during the night – their soundproofing for outside sounds was very good. When my neighbor used the shower or tub at night, though, it was noticeably loud (surprisingly so). Staff was very accommodating for my various requests, and the views are tough to beat.",New York,22,4.0

From a customer service standpoint, the front desk knew that it was our wedding. I was not expecting anything, but they could have at least written a card that said congratulations. Everything about this hotel screams "" this is New York city and we are too cool to do anything nice"". The room cost us close to $600 and it looked like it should have cost us $150. In terms of the bathroom, the lay out was the least of my concerns ( the toilet is literally a tiny closet, then there's the sink with no trash cans, then across the aisle is an open shower with no door). The bathroom amenities were absolutely minimal. The last time I saw shampoo, conditioner, and body wash attached to the shower wall was at my gym or maybe a motel 6. The products they use are a generic brand and for the money we spent I would have liked to see a luxury brand. I've stayed at Hampton Inns that gave their guest Peter Thomas Roth products. so this was a real shock. They also give you a lousy bag of 2 Q-tips and a cotton pad. The bed was fine as were the pillows. They provide you with a speaker that is chained to the wall which makes you feel like you question the clientele they are expecting. The carpet was disgusting and had stains all over it and the bathroom tub was clearly not cleaned in a very long time. I'm not sure if we had a uniquely bad experience, considering the other high reviews but if this is their "" standard"", I'd highly consider looking elsewhere for your hotel stay in NYC.","New York City, New York",1,2.0

Here’s some of the things that were not up to par:- no slippers, toothbrushes or kettle - these items should be supplied in-room for suite categories and above instead of having to be requested from housekeeping; that just reeks of management trying to cut costs.- ugly decor - the hotel pictures show a nice sunset pic of the Hudson River which makes the room look rather posh, but what they don’t show you is that the other half of the room is covered in cheap-ish red tiles that add a terrible contrast to the plush carpeted bed area (see attached pic).- badly planned and aging room fixtures - the open plan shower in the middle of the room is a disastrous idea; it has no door and clear glass, which makes it cold and wets the entire surrounding floor when used, and not many people appreciate being watched in plain view while they are showering, even couples. When a privacy curtain was requested, housekeeping came back with a $3 plastic shower curtain which completely ruined the look in the first place (see attached pic). Put in a door and frosted glass perhaps? As for the rest of the room, the toilet was also old and cheap looking, the sliding toilet door was broken and could not be closed completely, the basin area did not have enough space or hooks to hang towels, the curtains wouldn’t close completely which meant privacy issues especially at the shower area.- Unhelpful front desk staff - we asked for a few things during our stay; room upgrade which was an eligibility for our package booking, breakfast to be sent up to our room as my wife wasn’t feeling well, some sticky tape, and we didn’t get any of those requests fulfilled. The staff checking us in could have told us immediately if the upgradable rooms were full but he went behind to talk to his manager, which leads me to believe it was the manager’s decision not to upgrade us and not necessarily that it was full.- Budget amenities for premium rooms - our “free” breakfast had very few choices compared to what was on the paying menu, the internet was extremely slow ($20 for fast internet), and there was a ration of 2 bottles of water per day. These are very cheapskate options for a suite room.- subpar room views - the high price and selling point of the room we booked was a great view of the Hudson and the liberty statue, but both were marred by fog, rain and construction going on below. Obviously that wasn’t the fault of the hotel but it nevertheless contributed to our negative experience.Overall it was an extremely disappointing stay, especially after moving from the very excellent Baccarat hotel NY which was around the same price. If it was a $200 a night 3 or 4 star hotel it would be acceptable, but unfortunately not at this price point. I hope the management will make some good changes, but we will not be patronizing any Standard hotels in future.","Singapore, Singapore",2,2.0

Very good location just a few minutes from the Highline which is a disused railway track turned into a boardwalk that takes you to Hudsons Yard.

Don't bother with the expensive breakfast, instead, walk 5 mins. to Chelsea market and visit Sarabeth's bakery. There is a nightclub on the top floor so I would recommend a room on floor 11 or lower. We stayed for 4 nights and thought the rooms could do with a bit more storage space instead of the seats around a table which we never used. The lift is really funky showing 3D imagery of a montage of what looks a bit like Dante's Inferno. The lights in the lift could be brighter as it hard to see the floor buttons. They like black, the bathroom is tiled in black with black bathrobes. The separate toilet is a nice touch. Food is ok but recommend eating out either at one of the restaurants nearby or in Greenwich Village which is 10-15 mins walk.

I booked this hotel specifically for the bath tub as I was in need of an epsom salt bath. When I got up in the morning to take a bath before checkout, the drain plug was not functional. When I went to close the drapes at night, the blackout curtain got caught about a foot shy of closing and would not go all the way. As for the noise ... I guess I should not be surprised as it was a Saturday night in a chic hotel but being two floors beneath the nightclub, I could hear and feel the music playing until the early hours. To be fair they did supply complimentary ear plugs. Overall I was disappointed that I chose this hotel for so much money when I could have stayed at a more quiet hotel for less money since I didn’t get to take a bath anyway.",,1,2.0

First the housekeeping: check in was easy - I was a little early and my room was ready so I was able to go straight up. Staff were pretty friendly. My room was right near the elevator which worried me a bit but it wasn't too noisy. My view was south facing so part of the river as well as a bit of skyline and high line - very happy. The room itself is great -larger than some NYC hotels I've stayed in but not huge; furniture was cool scandi style and the bed was very comfortable. But it was very hot and I had to turn the air down very low to cool it down. All the appliances worked ok and the toiletries provided were pretty good. Of course the location is just great and since my purpose for being in Manhattan was to spend time chilling on the Highline with a book, it was perfect for me. The not so great news: the bar was booked out for private functions - not a major deal for me personally but I don't recall being advised when I booked and I think this would be a big problem for some visitors. Also no coffee machine - as I write this I am in an airport hotel near JFK: the TV doesn't work but there is a coffee machine! The lifts are pretty terrible - not calibrated at all so they were all on high floors when there was a queue of people in the lobby, slow and it didn't seem that all were working and there are only 4 I think (the up side of that is that you get more time to see the fabulous installation in the lifts so maybe the slowness is intentional once you get in one??). The hair-dryer is terrible - why do expensive hotels insist on rubbish hair-dryers when they can charge the customer if it goes missing. The Standard even has a note about a BOOK saying they will charge you if take it with you! So annoying. Finally, for a 2 night stay, there was an extra $180USD in taxes and fees not disclosed in the booking including a daily $25 facilities fee for I have no idea what since I didn't use any facilities, and a donation to something no one asked me if I wanted to make. Leaves a little bitter taste. Overall, I would say a bucket list ticked off nicely and a nice enough stay but I'm not sure I would do it again.","Sydney, Australia",34,4.0

At night, you can hear everything: other rooms’ conversation, toilet flushing, shower, water at sink.....imagine that! This is no way to fix! My colleagues’ rooms, my boss’ room, all the same. It means they have to remodel floor by floor. Next. I asked for wake up call at 7:00 am, with second wake up call 10 minutes after, NEVER HAPPENED! Luckily, I woke up. There was an important meeting that morning. It taught me to never rely on hotel’s wake up call. I addressed to the front that morning and was told that the computer system crashed, which sounded like a big b*llsh*t to me. I told them that this is Standard Hotel, not Holiday Inn or Motel 6, apology seemed like flying a kite! Then, elevator lobby corridor was closed, for whatever reason!

The Standard had just opened and was the Coolest New Thing back when I lived there, and the memory of peeing in their brand-new skyline-view bathroom of the bar was something I always treasured. I also thought being next to the High Line would be a fun thing for a kid, so instead of waiting for the very last minute to see what hotel was cheapest day-of, I booked a room at The Standard earlier on and really looked forward to staying there.I am a person who hates spending money but who loves nice hotels, and I was totally prepared to be disappointed but honestly, this was a wonderful experience. We were checked in by the lovely Gihan (guessing, hope I'm not ruining his name), who made sure we were in a room with a bathtub, which I think we initially were not. This is what made the trip because the bathtub was the most exciting aspect of our room, both for me and my kid (besides being right next to the ice machine, which was also very exciting for both of us).I cannot say enough about how great all the staff at The Standard were. Everyone we came into contact with, from Gihan (?) to the woman working in the gift shop to the housekeeping staff we saw in the hallway to the hostess gently denying us access to The Top of the Standard to Melissa, who checked us out, was so nice in that great-service New York City way that is not annoying or over-the-top but just so personable and comfortable and great.The only major disappointment of my stay is that children are not, in fact, admitted to the bar on the eighteenth floor, which was just so sad because I had this whole involved fantasy of buying my daughter a Shirley Temple and myself a Manhattan while we marveled at that incredible huge orange light thing and those views. However, I am aware that I definitely would not want any children around me if I were getting a drink there without one, so I actually think it is a good rule and they should stick to it. I'm not mad... maybe just a little sad.I had been kind of anxious after reading reviews here, even though it was a Sunday night, that there might be noise from the rooftop bar because the night before we had been kept up by blaring music until 2am while staying at a friend's house in Brooklyn. However, the night we spent on the 12th floor was probably the most quiet and restful I've ever had in New York. The bed was great, the bathtub was great, the room was spacious by Manhattan hotel standards and comfortable for having a friend over for a drink.In short, I had a great stay that surpassed my expectations. I have probably ruined my kid forever because now she thinks that's what staying in a hotel is like, but dozing in that ridiculously comfortable bed all morning while she watched Sponge Bob and we ate Amy's Bread chocolate-sourdough twists from the nearby Chelsea Market was honestly the highlight of our trip.",,0,4.0

I found check in friendly and efficient, as a fan of Prokofiev I loved the elevator. My room was exactly as I expected, not as tiny as I had been less to believe. Everything was fine on first impressions.... but when you want to rest....I was on the 15th floor, but the daytime noise rising from the outdoor Biergarten is really excessive. Then come night time, the bass noise of the top floor club is insanely loud and annoying for anyone sensitive to noise. Then to top it all off, the couple in the room next door sounded like they were recreating the famous window scene from the film ‘Shame’. The walls were so wafer thin it was borderline distressing.... at least someone was having a good time. The bar on the top floor was better then I thought. Once past the rude security guy on the door I found the bar staff exceptionally nice and warmed as the night went on. Expensive but the view is incredible. I left thinking the Standard is a bar and club that happens to have rooms as the needs of guests are underwhelming served. I had to wait over 20 minutes to get my stored luggage back.

Positives: friendly and fast staff, very clean, modern, bathroom amenities, gym is good and free laundry for gym (4 items per room per day), cool rooftop bar and good standard grill for breakfast at normal NYC prices.Negatives: the room was quite small and if you are on a high floor then you’ll hear the base and people talking from the nightclub, the Peleton’s in the gym didn’t work and one was placed on a slant so a bit wonky which was quite off putting when trying to cycle, the laundry benefit was great but 4 items is not enough for two people in a room especially if one is female given we normally have a sports bra as well as a top, most importantly the lifts were horrendous for guests, so many people (not staying at the hotel) trying to get up to the rooftop bar or nightclub meant we had to wait 10-15 mins each time we wanted to get up or leave our room (we asked and were told that we couldn’t use the stairs) and they really needed someone working there guiding at the bottom of the lift to advise non-guests that the lifts don’t actually take you to the rooftop bar!

This was my first trip to NYC and I knew I had to had to stay at this hotel so very badly. I was lucky enough to get a room. I arrived before checkin time after a 6 hour flight delay and wanted into a room very badly, but I also knew they had different floor plans and I had a specific on that I wanted. MELINDA at the front desk was AMAZING!! She got me into one room, but it had a divider installed, which I didn't want, so I went back down and asked or another room, felt bad already. I told her I wanted one without the divider. I waited for a short time, got food and coffee inside the cafe, then was shown to another room, which had no divider from the tub and room, but didn't have the kick ass l shaped couch that I wanted. I knew I WAS BEING A MONSTER, but I called back down and told MELINDA that this wasn't exactly right either. I then had no problem waiting while they stored my luggage and cleaned the floorplan of a room we wanted and she was just amazing and such good customer service. She even left us a nice complimentary bottle of wine. Sweet as Pie!! I can not stress enough how cool this hotel is, probs not for kids. and swanky. The room itself felt a very minimal beat up, as I'm sure people party in these rooms.The only 2 issues I had with the hotel were as follows: HOUSE KEEPING - they took my hair turban by mistake thinking it was a towel and it was never to be seen again. Lost and Found couldn't find it and they thought it got sent to their cleaning company and never came back. The other thing was GLASSES, which I still keep calling to check in on, because I KNOW they are probably still behind the bed. I fall asleep with my glasses on all the time and they always end up behind the head of the bed on the floor and in some crevice that house keeping just isn't seeing. The staff never called me back about any of these things and didn't offer anything to assist of their loses. I only think this bad, considering the brand should be trying harder to assist their guests in situations like this.","Los Angeles, California",0,4.0

I arrived and began checking in. Provided a passport and a Visa card. After taking an authorising for $400 (room charge was $200, I assume an additional $200 for incidentals), they realised I was using a temporarily issued Visa card. I lost my card a short time ago and await a permanent replacement. They then refused to continue check in despite having already taken $400. What difference is a temporary card? As long as it works right! It gets better. After saying it was there policy (which they couldn’t produce) to not accept a temporarily issued Visa card, they then said they could, if I rebooked directly with the hotel at an extra charge of $80 per night! Throughout this 3 hour experience in the reception in front of other guests I was spoken to like a second class citizen. When I finally decided to go to another hotel, they could even work out how to reverse the Visa card hold and said they’d send a screenshot which was never received.

Don’t Look Under the Bed! If you lose something, sacrifice it. You don’t want to look under the bed. And, then there is the air conditioning. Either the air intake is attached to the sewer or the air conditioner has not been cleaned since the place was built.

We were celebrating our anniversary, and we let them know when booking. No congratulations. No chocolate or note in the room, as many other 3.5 and 4-star hotels do. The staff seemed bothered every time we had a question or an issue to resolve. Service was nowhere near what a 4 star hotel should be in New York City. There was one front desk staff who was helpful. The others were less so.The bed. The bed in our first room was full-on broken. The coils were poking us. The guest services staff on the phone resolved the issue by moving us to another room. The front desk directed us there, but it seemed puzzling the front desk can't assist by talking with guest services. We switched rooms, and the bed was much improved. But for a 2-night stay, this is a big issue. It shows a lack of attention to detail that we saw everywhere. Tables were scratched up. Furniture was scuffed. Things needed to be painted and repaired in various places, including in the gym. We also realized after we switched that the A/C was not working properly in the first room. It was much cooler and more to our liking in the second room.Value. It's overpriced for what it is. I get that you're paying for the view and the location and the coolness factor. But that coolness factor has worn off a bit since the hotel was built in about 2009.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",133,3.0

My review is more about how the hotel and Meatpacking has changed since I left. The room was exactly what I expected, small, modern (if not a bit worn) with a river and downtown view. The new Whitney is a bit of an eyesore, but only a block away, is a nice option for an afternoon. The gym is amazing; it has panoramic views and the best part for me were the Peloton bikes. I did have a genial but confusing conversation with the concierge about the Top of the Standard and Le Bain. Basically, you need a reservation to get in, but they stop taking reservations after like 21h30 and then after that, it's ""members only"" and even if you're a hotel guest you still have to wait in line and are at the mercy of the doormen (translated: there is no guarantee you'll get in so be prepared to stand there and wait and have a Plan B that night). All that drama just to have a nightcap or dance a bit late night. They explained these two are now separate from the hotel and the hotel does not control the policies. Again, as someone who has lived in NY, it seems like a lot to go thru to have a drink, so if you're looking these kind of options, there are plenty around outside of the hotel. I probably would just take a walk north, south or east a few blocks and you will save yourself a few headaches and euros (or dollars, pounds). Another example, the breakfast in the hotel is outrageously expensive ($20-30). If you go out of the hotel and walk one block south, you'll see a little diner called Hector's. It's been there since 1949 and it is an authentic piece of the neighborhood. In this diner, you can have eggs, bacon and toast for around $12. Google it and there is an NYTimes article about them from a few years ago if you want more info. It's a NYC diner, so there are a lot more options and fair warning; if you are particular about your breakfast (as I can be some mornings) and want avocado toast and something IG worthy, then this is not your place.","Paris, France",44,4.0

Halfway through our trip, i had a meeting pop up which required us to stay longer.

They have some artsy film playing constantly in the elevators with naked people in suggestive poses. It’s like a loop that just keeps showing the same weird stuff over and over again.

I’m a freelance makeup artist and am always in hotels such as the standard taking clients monthly. I’ve always enjoyed working at the standard so for this specific staycation I thought what better place to stay then the standard high line. When calling to book my stay over the phone I did have to wait quite a while to reach reservations to finally speak to someone. I assumed they must be busy. When I finally got to speak to someone I was a little sad to hear the tone in his voice (I didn’t get his name) seem annoyed and bothered by having to help me book my stay. I explained to him I wanted to call and try to request a room with a Freestanding bath tub as the front desk person had assured me that many rooms were still available and it should be a problem. He immediately talked over me stating that he cannot promise a room with a freestanding tub unless I wanted to pay for the king corner rooms. I wasn’t opposed to it but didn’t understand why it would be so much trouble to accommodate me if their were so many open rooms still available. I explained again to him I’d really like a room with a tub as it was just for one night stay and he continued to cut me off and tell me I could not be promised a freestanding tub unless I paid more. So then upon reflection of price differences of the rooms he attempted to try and charge me more then what the prices listed online had been advertised for the room I originally wanted and for the room he was trying to up sale to me. I couldn’t honestly speak with him anymore out of frustration with his tone so I asked to speak to a manager otherwise I was about to book a different hotel. I was then transferred to my saving grace Sam. This hotel establishment should thank her for how amazing at customer care she is. She was able to listen to me and help me as efficiently and effectively as possible. She was in fact so nice to me that I ended up paying the extra to upgrade to the corner room just because she was so kind about trying to accommodate my stay. She understood that I too was in the service industry and valued my business with the hotel as it’s not something I’m always able to do for myself. I will for sure be staying with the hotel again. As per my stay goes, the room was beautiful. The view from the windows of the river and the city were gorgeous. I loved the open floor plan. I have never taken a more luxurious bath then while during this stay. I look forward to staying with the standard high line again and would also love to stay soon at their east Villige location.

As one jogs from afar on the High Line towards The Standard, in the right sunlight you are treated to an image of the building that resembles a standing, almost fully opened, glass hinge , somewhat of an architectural phenomenon. The soul of The Standard is hinged to the sheets of glass stacked 18 stories high which drape the exterior and afford guests with spectacular views of the Hudson River and associated cityscape from almost every point in the hotel. This hotel kisses the earth in a unique way as it is propped up on concrete stilts creating a bridge over the High Line...another engineering wonder associated with the building. Popular with the in-crowd and the out-crowd for that matter, The Standard encompasses a bevy of busting dining-and-drinking venues very appealing to locals and tourists alike. Because it skirts the High Line, many Park events and participants use The Standard as a check point (Think: good for business). The most dramatic, physical, interior, asset is the floor-to-ceiling windows everywhere (just the backside of the outside) which permit killer views of the real thing, NYC (no virtual reality here).When you hunker down in your room you will be welcomed by wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling windows which illuminate the room dramatically with natural light and let you cash in on those spectacular vistas again. Rooms are compact (not unusual for NYC) with a white and beige colour palette, much like you would find in a cruise ship cabin. An exciting feature of selected rooms is the exposed peek-a-boo tub: peek is near the window for a revealing view while boo: is asking for a shower curtain for privacy. Remember, don't streak naked around your room, someone may be watching. And when it comes time to hit-the-hay you can gaze out of your window wall and count NYC skyscrapers until you fall asleep ( give the sheep a night off).Although the Meatpacking District is known for its hip nightlife and fine dining eateries, The Standard has these facilities right on its front porch. The Standard Grill, a classic-bistro type setting, ushers out American cuisine, is busy X 2. The innovative menu is meat heavy with entree's such as dry-aged ribs, pork chops, the old standby: burgers, steaks amongst others. It has a unique tile floor constructed of pennies, almost 1/2 M of them (this is surely a big wishing well). Another eating option is the Grill Cafe with an extensive menu and sidewalk seating which is a favourite with the summertime guests. On the 18th floor is a bar called: Le Bain, with a plunge pool and roof terrace, again with more views. Then there is the Top of the Standard Lounge. Pretty eccentric, for the rich and famous although sometimes regular folks get in: who knows maybe you can rub shoulders with NYC a-listers and celebs. If you just want to hang out, then the lobby Living Room will do just fine with its groovy lay back area, tasty nibbles and handcrafted drinks. For beer lovers, The German-inspired Biergarten is stocked with taps of European beer (some domestic also) served up in huge mugs with giant pretzels all more suitable for consumption by the The Hulk. If you are sober enough, you can play ping pong.Guests can get pumped up in the spacious 24 hour state-of-the-art gym. while their eyes feast on more panoramic vistas. The Standard has a beefed up concierge team, dubbed ""travel consultants"".This is not butler service , but it is getting close.So in NYC, if you fancy a view from any point, relish lavish and modern digs, and appreciate the advantage of fine dining tucked inside the hotel.....try The StandardHigh Line.................A Hotel With A View.","Ottawa, Canada",122,4.0

The Standard Queen was a small but expertly-designed room, so although there wasn't much open space, I had everything I needed. There was a comfortable booth-style L-shaped bench with a large table that was perfect for getting some work done and then relaxing with a glass of wine and some room service later in the evening. The deep bathtub has a glass wall in it, providing clear views of the rest of the room and whatever happened to be outside my giant floor-to-ceiling window. I suspect the glass is intended to be a sexy detail for romantic overnights, but whatever, I used it to watch trashy TV from the bathtub. The details were lovely - the beds were comfortable, the robes were luxurious, the toiletries were Davines (smelled so good I showered twice during an overnight stay), and the room service/mini bar options were spot on. I was so relaxed after room service and a trashy TV bath that I was ready to fall asleep at a totally reasonable hour (rare for me).BUT the club a few floors up had different plans. My first room was on the 14th floor, and Le Bain is on the 18th floor. Notwithstanding the three floors of space between me and the DJ, I could physically feel the beat from the driving dance music as I attempted to doze off to sleep. Meanwhile, the rest of the music and the voices of its loud patrons ricocheted off of the glass building just north of the Standard in such a way that it seemed like it was all happening right outside my window. Le Bain is fun. I like Le Bain. People should be loud and get drunk up there; however, it's not a great place to sleep beneath. Although the hotel provided complimentary ear plugs, I couldn't drown out the noise. This was a huge bummer since I was there for work and had a meeting early the next morning.But, the staff saved the day. I called the front desk and they immediately moved me to a corner suite on a much lower floor without so much as a question asked. Within five minutes, new keys were delivered to my door by a staff member who helped me move all of my things to the new room. I finally fell asleep and woke up to sunny views of the Empire State Building and the new and interesting skyscrapers springing up along the skyline. The new room was fantastic - big, separate deep tub inside a fully tiled bathing area with a rainfall shower head nearby. The room had ample space for walking around and peeking into the office buildings nearby (the Samsung building is really cool). Checkout was easy.TL;DR next time I stay here, I'll make sure it's a weekend so I can be the one at Le Bain who is keeping all the other guests awake.",,0,3.0

The German beer garden is a little anomalous but nevertheless good fun while the bar, restaurants and gym were all very cool. The brunch was particularly good. The gym is up on the 17th floor and has its cardio machines lined along the floor to ceiling windows which is a little disconcerting for people like me with a fear of heights as it feels like you are running/cycling/skiing out towards the edge. As we were warned, the rooms are quite small but well designed to make the most of the space.

The first person we encountered was Samantha Yang who checked us in. She set the tone right away that we were in for a great week. Sam was professional, personal, and kind - and she even found us an upgraded room for a great rate. All the staff were friendly and supportive. Rooms are clean and for the most part quiet. The gym is open 24 hours and has two Peloton bikes (supports both kinds of cleats plus loops for casual cyclers)! Cool. Restaurants there were great (not the 'it's good for hotel food' excuse; these are actually great places to eat)--. It's a high end quirky place with a wink and a sense of humor. There was a 'pool' area in front of the lobby--. There is actually no pool at all, but everything else is--reclining beach loungers, umbrellas, blue astroturf (to simulate the pool), a bar with tropical drinks, a bocci ball setup with a shark fin in the sand- They pull it off and do it well. While riding the elevators you enjoy this amazing movie collage depicting a montage of 300 films put together. It was very cool -- there is a beautiful classical orchestral piece that plays along with it---- it runs in one continuous loop, however, and after 5 days of hearing it my wife and I joked that the tune starts to show up in your dreams (small quibble really, more of a joke, ). Would be nice to have different music rotated in--but I'm sure the artist would have to give permission. Rooftop bar was amazing--the view of the city is simply spectacular. Think of a party from 'The Great Gatsby' but without the snobbery and you are getting close. Live music, great drinks, fun atmosphere. Just a note that when meeting people up there that there is another rooftop establishment there called Le Bain. It is a cool rooftop hangout as well - but you have to use a separate elevator at the street level to get into to either place. The Standard's Rooftop bar and Le Bain share different parts of the same roof - and even though they connect to one another through a set of double doors (where you can see and hear each venue), you are nonetheless directed back to the street level into the proper elevator to come right back up to get into either place. Just know where you're meeting so you choose the right elevator entrance. You are close to great restaurants, Chelsea market, the Whitney Museum, and of course, the High Line walking area which runs right through the Hotel. This is an absolute do-over. You will have no regrets :)","Los Angeles, California",2,5.0

It was too busy being focused on being to cool to make any effort at hospitality.  Fast forward 8 years, and our 3 night stay was the most delightful hotel experience we’ve had in a long time. In the past six months, I stayed at a dozen four- and five-star hotels. The Standard was among the very best. From great bathroom products and daily bottles water to staff who are concerned and dedicated to providing the best possible hotel experience. The fitness gym is well appointed and offers free laundry of work-out gear. The front desk and housekeeping staff were all very friendly and helpful. The bars and restaurants were delightful and did not make us feel like we were unwanted or not “cool” enough to dine or have drinks there.

The base was reverberating through the walls, people were partying in the hallway on my floor till midnight and the front desk was not able to solve the problem. I had always stayed on lower floors before but didn’t realize I needed to request this. They SHOULD NOT book the rooms below the club unless they offer these rooms at a discount and with full transparency about this. It is likely that people who are at the club and up till 4 am by choice are happy to stay in them. I AM NOT. When I asked if I could move rooms, I was informed the hotel was full.

I actually thought he was joking - no apology was made and no effort was made to compensate for his mistake in telling me this. After getting to my room I called down to double check and make sure there were no other rooms available - there were no other rooms. When asked if I could pay to upgrade they ask to call me back - fine. The front desk never called back and could even when I offered to pay extra. I called back down to the front desk and was told no one was aware of my call. I then had drinks / food at the top of the standard / boom boom room. The experience started off lovely until our waiter disappeared for about 45 minutes and no person would assist. I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for the check and take the check back to the bar to close out. When the waiter returned he said he had ""been on break"" and didn't seem think it was important that we were taken care of while away (shocking after spending $600 on drinks / food). When I told the front desk they told me any complaints would be made the hostess at the restaurant as they ""have nothing to do with the top of the standard"" - all I was looking for was an I'm sorry for your experience"".

On the positive side, the architectural concept is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and the floor to ceiling windows in the rooms make for a spectacular view. The service was excellent all around and the Standard Grill, the Grill Cafe, the Standard Biergarten, and the Top of the Standard were all first-rate. On the negative side, my room was surprisingly small and spartan for the price, reminded me very much of a ship cabin, and was a bit worn around the edges (loose wood trim on the wall, loose carpet on the floor). There was very little storage or closet space. I get that they're going for an edgy vibe, but I can see that it would be a bit much for some. Be ready for sunlight in your room in the morning, no matter what you do -- the same windows that allow for such a great view do not have light blocking drapes. I was particularly frustrated that information available from the hotel about layout, services, and amenities is VERY minimal, both online and in the room. There was no guide to the hotel in the room or on TV except for the room service menu, so I had to call or go downstairs for information. Now that I'm more familiar with the hotel through some trial and error, I would give it a go again, but would seriously consider a splurge for a larger room. It's not for everyone, but they're not trying to cater to everyone. ","Lafayette, Louisiana",1,4.0

BUT...Do not stay here on Friday and Saturday nights. Unless of course you don't mind the bass sound shaking your bed until 4am from the club within the hotel. I get it - the hotel attracts a young, hip crowd. BUT - if you are going to have a club utilizing the sound system that you do, DO NOT have a hotel below it. From my understanding, a hotel is to rest, refresh...this did not happen during my stay. The hotel provides ear plugs (warning sign number one) - which are completely useless for the noise that is generated. In addition - do not expect a solution, be able to check out etc from hotel if have pre paid. The hotel team must have heard this a hundred times, so brush you off.

The front desk staff (eszter comes to mind, but they're all very welcoming) whisks you painlessly through the paperwork and either you can take their seriously postmodern elevator (you'll know what I mean when you get inside) to your room or stop at the outdoor cafe for a Martini (my preference). You know, these places always want you to mention staff members by name but at age 75, I can't, sorry. I can tell you that there is not a more welcoming, warm and efficient staff in any hotel in the U.S. (and forget Europe altogether).  We liked the Standard Grill so much, we returned the next evening and (seriously) one by one, every staff member came over and thanked us for returning. Oh, I must mention, the food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. When it comes to prices, always remember the phrase ""I am in Manhattan. I will not expect a bargain."" If you want to stay in some air bnb and wash your hands after touching the doorknob, that's your business. My wife and I come to NY every two years for the Whitney Biennial which is around the corner. 2019 was disappointing but a day at MOMA made up for it. Try to go outside for the HighLine. New Yorkers are justifiably proud of it Oh, BTW, your room at the Standard will be as clean as a surgical suite in a hospital and have more amenities than you'll ever use. They've got an excellent gym and a great nightclub on the roof if you happen to be a thirty something. I'm not and exited ASAP but the crowd is seriously fun to watch. Those heels, that pervasive insecurity. Makes me definitely NOT want to be young again.Only one complaint: please get inroom coffee makers. I'm too parsimonious to order a cup of coffee from room service (plenty of coffeeshops nearby) but to be able to make cup on arising would make everything perfectGo ahead.

After a four-year hiatus from NYC, I came back for work and was reminded about why it's such a magical city. Staying at The Standard was a great book end to each day for my 3 night trip. While the rooms are definitely on the pricey end, and the hotel can sometimes feel like it's a bit overrun by folks clamoring to indulge at one of its many fine bars/restaurants - these seem like reasonable trade offs for its prime location + views.PROs:- Quick/efficient check in & out - staff was prepared (Thanks Samantha Yang for making it easy!)- Several restaurants and bars located on premise to fit any mood (quiet drink in or party out).- Literally atop the High Line providing easy access to Chelsea Market and lots of other fun spots in the Meatpacking District- Walking distance to several other bars/restaurants if you want to venture out of the hotel- 5 min walk to the 14th St station for quick access to the rest of the city.- Spectacular views looking west.CONS:- In the evening, the hotel draws a lot of outside partygoers (who are headed to its well-known bars) which can create a bit of traffic in the lobby and congestion at the lifts.FYI:- In some rooms (or least mine and my friend's), the divide between the shower and the bed is just a glass partition.

If your looking for a different scene with a bit of quirkinesses then this place is for you. I definitely recommend this space for a weekend getaway, as the rooms are intimate. Keep in mind that this is New York, room size will be comfortable- including the closet space. As far as amenities, everything is in the room, Including a bluetooth speaker. If your not looking to step out of your room to purchase snacks and beverages they are actually placed in cabinets for your convenience. I got so caught up with the room style that during the night I realized the beds are low rise (touching the floor).This is actually great , I was able to fall asleep to a great view of Manhattan( depending on the room type of course). The one thing I absolutely adored the most was the oversized bathtub next to floor to ceiling windows with the view of Manhattan. It absolutely makes a difference for a relaxing stay. I went ahead and brought a bath-bomb to top it all off! The hotel does have a restaurant on site and a club (so keep that in mind if you don’t mind music on the last floor). But overall this place by far has caught my heart ♥️ . Guest service is always super friendly. But shout out to Ryan in reservations for being such a superstar. He might have not been behind the desk at check in, but he had the same hospitality over the phone by going above and beyond.

There was no iron or ironing board in the room and the full length window lets a LOT of light in the morning. Frankly the standard king room is average and not memorable other than the view. The Top of The Standard and the Standard Grill are the showpieces of the hotel with great views and service.

I understand that they have no control over construction, but the very least they could do is to tell you about it when you book directly with the hotel. Same for the closed bar (which is a big part why we used to like this hotel). On top of everything, they were doing maintenance on the windows, so we were asked to keep our curtains closed to avoid having someone peeking in your room. Seriously? So no restaurants, patios, rooftop bar and no view... what’s the point?!? And as a special surprise, the phone started beeping at 4 in the morning for 3 hours straight, just because it was broken.

Also upon check in, they asked for a swipe of a card for any incidentals during the duration of our stay - pretty standard practice - only they didn't mention a substantial amount of money would be held - and not released for a considerable length of time after the stay. In fact, still waiting for it to be released now, despite confirmation from the hotel that there was no additional charges to the room and further attempts to contact the hotel have been ignored.

You can easily start at the bottom of the Highline and take the incredibly beautiful walk up to the other end getting a unique view of the city including Hudson Yards.As far as the hotel goes, it's easy to find and there are employees out front to assist you with luggage. Check in is fairly quick and friendly given the tight quarters in the lobby if there is a rush. We used the valet parking at $65/day to smooth out logistics. They do require at least half an hour to retrieve your car when the time comes.The rooms make the most out of the small amount of square footage and the wall of glass makes it feel larger. The shower is separated from the bed by a glass wall so any pretense of modesty would not work here. If you choose to leave the curtains open, the world can observe it all.

I’m a regular at chiltern firehouse in London so I know the standard of service at his properties.However, from the moment I checked in, I should have realised that I was going to be in for a disappointing experience. Check in took more than 10 minutes with this lady who didn’t seem to know what was going on with her computer system. And that was after I had to wait for a couple checking in before me for another 10 mins!The people at reception looked like they were college kids doing part time jobs. They didn’t look smart/chic/sharp. They looks messy and dowdy. I can’t believe that one guy’s necktie was actually facing the other way and his shirt was untucked like someone who’s about to go to his first day in school.The interior of the building and the room was more like the style of the dated hotels within the Morgans Hotel group.The menu for in-room dining was sub par.I could hear water running through the pipes in my bathroom every time the room next to me turned on their taps so this woke me up regularly. I can hear whenever things were getting knocked over in the next room.I wasn’t feeling very well (little did I know it was the initial symptoms of gastroenteritis) and when I asked guest services if they can get me some paracetamol/Imodium, the answer I received was I had to go down myself to buy the medicine because of NY regulations. No apologies, no sympathy. If this is really what NY regulations say, it’s fine, I accept it but there’s always a way to say no to a hotel guest especially when the hotel guest is already ill. When I went down, I spoke to the concierge about this and told them I’m disappointed that they couldn’t help out a guest who was ill and can barely walk, the concierge then gave me a conflicting answer and said they can buy me medicine but I’d have to pay $20 service charge. Eventually I spoke to the manager about this and she confirmed that the concierge was incorrect—they indeed aren’t able to buy medicine for guests due to NY regulations.I only got a pot of tea as an apology for this screw up.On my last day I was in real pain that I asked the hotel whether they had an in house medical officer and the guy from guest services on the phone didn’t seem to know if they had one so he had to put me on hold and eventually told me that his colleagues told him they have a doctor on call for $500 for in room visits. My friend also stayed at the hotel at the same time as I did. We both extended our stay for one more night given that our flights back to London weren’t until late in the evening so we thought it would be good to have a room to go back to and freshen up before the flight. I was able to extend my room without any problems. Whereas she had to run around just to extend her room. She was asked to call at a certain time then asked again to call at another time, then she was asked to go down and show her ID. They also forgot to clean her room so she had to stand there watching housekeeping clean her room when all she wanted was to relax and get ready for her flight. They also charged her $60 for something from the mini bar which she didn’t have.Also the hotel didn’t feel special at all. The lifts are always busy, full of people waiting at the lobby. This ain’t a place you want to stay in if you want to stay somewhere special in NY. If you want just a step above the holiday inn, then maybe this is the place for you.The only one good thing was the guy outside the hotel who helps guests with their baggage and hail cabs/uber. He was very smart and alert and very helpful. I should have gotten his name and posted it here as maybe he’s the only who deserves a promotion. To the management of the hotel: He was working at 6pm on 24 March 2019, in case you want to give him some credit.","London, United Kingdom",0,1.0

Additionally they upgraded me to a King room from a queen and made sure that they had a great night at the biergarten. When I got to my room I soon ordered room service and whoever was on the other end of the line was one of the friendliest people I have ever spoken to.

The views over Hudson and One World Trace Center are fantastic, and the location is great with its proximity to a an interesting neighborhood, the High Line and mire.The rooms are a bit small, though, and a bit worn down. Not too bad, but given the price, I'd expect a higher standard. For instance, the faucet in my bathroom sink kept on dripping throughout the night, and when I let the staff know. They first had their engineers to look at it, but said it was ""unfixable"". Then they handled it professionally and offered me another room. Given that the new room would just be the same, though, and I had to pack up all the things I had, I declined and instead just put a towel in the sink each evening to stop the sound.The gym itself is not much to work out in, and would need barbells and more workout opportunities.All-in-all, though, a good stay with good service and – of course – amazing views. :-)",,47,4.0

My room was bigger than I had expected (but still NYC-small) and had all comforts including Netflix, good amenities, fast wifi, very well-stocked minibar. When I ordered room service and when I ordered foam pillows, the knock on the door seemed almost immediate.As others have said, there is only clear glass between the shower and the bed - that and the size of the room made the standard queen very comfortable for one person, perhaps a bit crowded for two. Bed very low to the ground and you really have to step up and over into the shower/bathtub so not recommend for anyone with mobility issues!Downstairs lobby bar was loud at all times but I did not hear any noise from any of the bars in my 13th floor room, even on Saturday night.

The staff was amazing, especially Marco at the front desk who was extremely helpful and took the time to find us an incredible corner king room with expansive views of the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade, Empire State Building, and the Hudson River from its floor to ceiling windows! The room had a very comfortable king bed, and nice corner couch/bench with a table, and a huge windowed walk in shower! The modern design of the hotel itself and it’s rooms is visually striking and well thought out. The hotel is located in the heart of the meatpacking district and super close to the Whitney Museum and lots of cool bars and restaurants. The hotel itself has a casual Biergarten, The Standard Grill a great restaurant for brunch of dinner ( there is a cafe side and a more formal restaurant area), The Top of the Standard 18th floor cocktail lounge with live jazz on occasion and breathtaking sweeping city views ( a must if you are from out of town and want a top shelf craft cocktail as you take in the magnificent skyline), and another top floor club, Le Bain, that features DJ’s, an outdoor lounge area, and even mini indoor pool for late night fun. There is also a chill little red lounge as you enter the hotel with comfortable chairs and couches that offers drinks and some food, and a dj spinning downtempo at night. During the day its a great place to relax with a coffee and a magazine or ipad. Angel in the lounge area was very friendly and insured I had a great latte to start my day during our stay. Rooms were immacualtely cleaned in a timely manner too. If you are planning a trip to NYC this is your go to hotel, forget Times Square or Financial, stay here and you have a great neghborhood to come home to and every type of restaurant or bar you could want within walking distance, plus you can take advantage of fantastic ones in the hotel itself.

The hotel staff moved us to another, larger room as compensation. This was a nice gesture...except they moved us to a floor where the air conditioning was malfunctioning during the hottest days of July (we found out the next morning that this was a known problem in the hotel that evening, though no one cared to tell us this before we consented to a move around 10 or 11pm). We actually ended up checking out early on the morning of our anniversary because the room was so unbearably hot.

First night we were in a room (1408) without bathtub and asked to be changed to a room with bath tub. Shower in 1408 didn’t have as good pressure and was quite noisy as soon as the neighbors showered and heard the beats from the rooftop nightclub. We switched to 1305 on our second day. We really enjoyed the second room, no noise at all and slept super well!Pros: great city view with sunrise over the Empire State Building, extremely comfy bed, room was very clean. Location is great in every way, close to a lot of shopping, The Whitney, restaurants etc. We also enjoyed the Rooftop bar for sundowners, as well as the biergarten for pingpong and beer.Cons: lacks a bit of the “hotel feeling” - upon check in they don’t offer to help you with luggage nor said anything about the facilities. You were kind of left with the key card to find your own way to the room. Breakfast wasn’t included, but that was ok as there are plenty of options in the neighborhood. The Standard Grill breakfast was ok at best. Staff in the reception didn’t seem super engaged - but perhaps that’s the NYC vibe.Conclusion: great value for money - would come again!

I saw an extremely low rate for their hotel and booked for a business trip. When the meeting was cancelled, I logged on to cancel the reservation (about 30 hours pre-arrival - more than the industry standard 24-hour window). Needless to say, I was surprised to find that it said I was past the window and that I would be charged for the first night.I requested that they refund the money since I was giving them 30+ hours notice and they obviously are not at capacity if they have rooms priced at $200 per night (extreme discount relative to what they normally are there). They wrote back and said (rather coldly and bluntly) that their policy allows them to keep my money and they were going to do just that. Obviously, policy is policy, but at some point you would hope a human element would kick in and make a judgement call to apply common sense instead of the revenue driven policy. I could understand if I cancelled the morning of arrival.. or if they'd been sold out for a week and could have resold the room if I'd let them... but... I gave them 30-hours notice (more than is typically required) and they still had rooms available that they hadn't sold.So, just be cautious if you are considering booking here. Read all the fine print really well, because they are going to hold you to every word. I personally will look elsewhere next time because a) I need the flexibility when travelling for work and b) I can't trust that they value customer satisfaction.","Chicago, Illinois",1,2.0

Our major complaint would be the quality of the response of staff - there were long delays in requests for extra bedding, room service, or any other items.

On the first night of my stay, I was on the 14th floor. This was utter hell. Not only could I hear the music ALL night, I could LITERALLY feel the bass. I asked to be moved away from the noise but no rooms available. I was moved this morning, day two, and am only wasting my time writing this in this moment because I’m once again being kept awake, even on the 9th floor (8 long floors below the club) and need a distraction from my exhaustion. It is currently 3am. Maybe I would care a little less if I was on vacation, but I’m not. When I called the front desk to complain, it was like they had heard this complaint so many times it was as expected as someone calling to order room service. (Doing the math, I’m calculating they must hear the complaint about 193 times per night: 1x20 from each of the 20ish rooms per floor X top 10 floors of the hotel, minus the few drunk guests here for the club, along with a few foreign tourists who don’t speak enough English to complain, and probably at least one Japanese couple too polite to say anything). I hate this place. I hate the plastered girls stumbling over in the elevator. I hate the unnecessarily dark hallway leading to that too slow elevator. I hate that they don’t even offer any red wine in their minibar selection to help lessen the pain of the whole experience.

Also after 25 minutes of waiting for the elevator up or down you may just choose to take the stairs. Again, though it’s not their fault 3 of the 4 elevators are broken and they can’t do anything about it, they don’t seem to care or want to fix it.

I realized that multiple towels had a clear purpose. Amenities are of high quality although shampoo has funky scent something like clover. Front desk, reception folks are somewhat distant and removed to interact with client or customers. They plan to rush to clean out guest and when I asked about maps, folders about NYC attractions they made a funny face slightly ironice. Some can be attentive but then call next guest but I had better interaction with cab drivers than staff. I have never seen someone as manager or director, seems they need someone to really offers welcoming experience. Honestly I was not pleased with lack of warm or welcoming experience. None of that were ever close to what I was expecting. I am a genius booking and travel very very frequently. I was expecting to have a better experience from hotel and staff needs to be retrained urgently. I highly recommend having a drink at the top of standard bar, live jazz and · Concierge was non-responsive.

We really enjoyed our stay - good staff on reception, confusing layout on ground floor, too damn dark to see the menu in the ground floor bar or the buttons in the lift (although we did really like the surreal lift, ridiculous as it is), and fab views from the cocktail bar. Book at table in advance if you want to sit down though. Pay the extra for a room with wall to ceiling windows overlooking the Hudson - they are small, but the ours was great. Comfy bed with good quality bed linen and a great shower. Plus I could lie in bed and see my husband’s pert bum whilst he had a shower (and for that matter I guess so could everyone on the road down below!), because the bathroom is effectively in the bedroom. The toilet is thankfully separate though. Be careful about the noise - we were on the 4th floor and the bass from the club on the 18th floor vibrated right through the room until 4am. Fortunately we were so exhausted from sightseeing and jet lag that we could have slept in the middle of the freeway and it wouldn’t have bothered us. Overall then, we’re glad we stayed, but the hotel is getting a bit tired and we’re getting a bit old, so we’d probably stay somewhere else next time.

If you like a cacophony of experimental wall surfaces in your hotel lobby, a layout at ground floor level which makes heavy weather of finding anything and an elevator that's so dark you can't read the buttons this is for you. Definitely a case of style over substance. No surprise then, that nothing was very straightforward. The German Beer Garden relied on a ticket system and the rooftop bar ( brilliant views and chilled atmosphere) greeted me by making me go out again to check with the staff at the door that I could get a table ( I has already done this...a little unwelcoming to someone on their own) and room service for tea in the morning that arrived with loose leaf tea and a pot of water i.e. make it yourself. What wound us up most though was the check-in staff and their complete lack of interest. No attempt to offer us any info ( like...where the hell is the elevator), hardly uttered a word and no eye contact. Our room contained a copy of 1984...was this a clue?

At first it does feel like you're arriving into a nightclub, but check in was straightforward and staff are helpful.We stayed in a Hudson Studio room - great views of the river, although there is construction work going on nearby so the floor to ceiling windows don't allow a lot of privacy. The shower is screened off by totally clear glass, so if you're staying here with a companion, do make sure that you know them very well - if not, you soon will do! The toilet is closed off by sliding door, but it didn't slide the full way, so not ideal...Views and cocktails from Top of the Standard bar are incredible, the decor here is really lovely. The noise from Le Bain nightclub, however, is unbearable - thumping music which goes on until 4am is a real buzzkill if you're jetlagged and need sleep...the hotel had provided earplugs, but they did nothing to muffle the banging bass.

Excellent views from much of the property - on one side all rooms face the river so no bad views from what we could tell. On the other side, you need to go up pretty high to get a decent ""city view"" - our first room on floor 11 (more about switching rooms later) had an unimpressive look across at the adjacent buildings, but when we moved on up to floor 15, we had a really nice view, including the Empire State Building. The room itself was cool, in a 1970's sort of way. It had the feel of a large cruise ship cabin, excellent floor to ceiling windows, basic but comfortable furnishings, small bathroom, very comfortable bed, extremely good shower (powerful and easily adjustable temperature). Not a ton of storage space, no drawers, just small shelves - ok for 2 nights but not sure what you'd do with more luggage than we had. Extremely quiet for a hotel in NYC - no noise from hallway or street, which was a pleasant surprise. We didn't try any of the on-site amenities except the beer garden, which was a lot of fun, it was outdoors but nicely heated on a chilly October evening, and super-friendly staff, especially Orlando, who was a great companion for game 5 of the World Series.So while there were a lot of positives, our experience with the front desk was truly horrible. We arrived at 2:30pm on a Saturday, waited in line, then were told by the lady at the desk that check-in time was 3pm, our room was ""almost ready"", and they would call us as soon as it was, probably around 3, but no later than 3:30. No problem for us. We went for a walk, not too far since we were expecting their call, which never came. We returned at 3:45, waited in line (again), different person at the desk, this time a sullen guy in a grubby shirt who didn't look up. I said we were expecting a call but never got one, to which he just grunted. Eventually got keys and went to our room. When we opened the door, there was an unpleasant smell, but at this point we were tired and irritated, so opted to just open the windows while we went out for the evening. Spent the night with windows open, smell was no better in the morning so I went to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms. Waited in line (again), was greeted by the original lady from the day before. Told her the room smelled like stale vomit that hadn't been properly cleaned, to which she replied ""well did one of you vomit?"" OMG, really?!?!? (no we did not). Then she asked why we didn't report it the day before so I said we were not thrilled with our check-in experience and were too tired to deal with it. She immediately became VERY defensive and pointed out at least 6 times that we arrived at 2:30 and check-in is at 3. Just kept repeating that, even when I pointed out that she said she'd call us by 3:30 and never did. She said she went on break. She seemed intent on arguing and proving herself right (customer service error #1), so I asked for the manager. Long delay, then I get ""she's in a meeting, but she'll call you"". So we went for a walk.... Over an hour later we get a call, manager says no problem on switching rooms, then put me on hold for ever, came back and said they were getting the room ready, but wouldn't give me the room number. I said we'll be back in 10 minutes, she said room would be ready. Back to lobby, wait in line (again), room not ready. They sent us up to original room, said they'd call in a few minutes. 15 minutes later, no call, so I called front desk to be told a guy would be ""coming right up"" with keys to the new room. Another 15 minutes pass, no guy with keys, so I call again and was told they'd be sending him right up. Eventually he did appear, new room was fine, no smell, and we decided to put away the negative experience with the front desk and enjoy the rest of our stay, which we did, hence the positives mentioned above.However, the appalling customer service we received was completely unacceptable and should be a total embarrassment to the hotel. But I got the impression this was just their regular way of doing business, they don't care, because they're in NYC, have a decent property and can fill their rooms with an endless supply of people they can treat badly - and charge a ridiculous amount to do so. Hopefully others will read this and think twice about staying here, it was so disappointing because good service would have made us repeat customers for sure.","Austin, Texas",89,3.0

The rooms are tight but well organized and I personally love that the shower is totally open to the view. No wall to it. The front desk was a real problem. it has 4 stations, though in 3 days they never had more than two people and there was almost always a long line. The service once you got to the front was friendly, but super slow. Nobody behind the desk was in a hurry. Which works if you spend the money on 4 front desk folks, but does not if you only have one or two and there is a long line behind. To top it off, there is no concierge desk, so if you wanted to check in a wheelchair, which we did, ask a question about a restaurant, or check in for your room, it was the one single same super slow line. It is not a big lobby, so the line actually was a problem to people getting in and out of hotel. Also, our rooms key cards kept failing. In 3 days with two rooms, 4 cards stopped working. Kind of annoying situation turned into just ridiculous when we had to, you guessed it, go through the whole line again to get a replacement key. This because the front desk folks are very well trained to pay 100% attention to the person in front of them. Absolutely zero multitasking, regardless of the request. And it was just rude to ask other guests in line who had been waiting 15 mins for check in, to let us pass ahead because our key stopped working. I might return for the views, but only if I didn’t have to have any interaction at all with the front desk. Seems unlikely, so seems unlikely. ","Palo Alto, California",88,2.0

Our room was on the 15th floor with a view of the city including the Empire State. Floor to ceiling windows, beautiful furniture, huge bed and great own brand toiletries. There's a TV you can project with Airplay and a WiFi speaker in the room too.We made our way to the rooftop bar around 1am - the hotel makes it clear not to expect to get in as they have a selective door policy. Most people were turned away in front of us but we made it in as a duo. We must be really awesome and cool right? Yaaaaas. The rooftop is the best. 360 views of the city and great music and great vibe. With a hot tub. Try and go the cocktail lounge in mid afternoon for a really great experience too. Everything is in the detail. The elevators. The shop. The dress code for the staff. So, so cool.We made it to brunch in the morning and had the burger which was delicious. Great atmosphere outside and not too busy. Diplo and Mark Ronson then walked past to check-in. Validated for us this is the coolest place in NYC to stay!We love The Standard Highline.

The 5th floor is TOO LOW and very noisy with a thump thump thump all night until 5 am at the next door nightclub - I know it is nyc but this was over the top even for nyc.  The gym was tiny and crowded with odd equipment several of which were broken.  We skipped the hotel restaurants for other better local spots. Dont count on seeing me Bain as both night we were here it was reserved for private parties. Great location for pire touristy stuf. - walk the crowded high line or Chealsa Market and decent shopping around. The comfy bed was a waste give the noise - and lots of bath amenities.  Plenty of towels and a nice seating area.  They are building a pier or building in the water in front as of Oct 2018 so check the views at $900 per night!   Returaunt was so pretentious so skip it and go to bubbys down the street.  Staff provided the minimum expected service - no more with the exception of the housekeeper who was exceptional.

Let's start with the positives. The room I stayed in had amazing views over the Hudson. The whole glass windows gives you an incredible view of both Downtown and the river. Even on a cloudy day I didn't get bored of looking at it. The room itself was small, pretty standard I guess in NYC, but you can do better. It was well appointed and comfortable. The neighbourhood is also great with some nice bars, restaurants and shops. It's a really relaxing place to stay and obviously the High Line is right by the door.My check in/check out experience was good and quick and staff were helpful. I ate breakfast in the ground floor restaurant every day and the food was goof. I also had dinner and a drink in the rooftop bar and despite reviews saying otherwise, the service and food was also v good. The view is of course amazing.My major issues with the hotel revolve around their policies. By far the most irritating and disappointing was the fact that after 9pm, you cannot use the hotel lift to get to the Rooftop bar. I was meeting a colleague there after a working dinner and I couldn't work out why the 18th floor button wouldn't work, either from the 15th (my floor) or reception, In the end I had to ask some (v friendly) cleaners who explained you had to go to the Lobby, walk out the hotel, go through a cordon, get screened by bouncers and then enter a separate lift after 9pm. They apologised profusely for the stupid policy although it was clearly nothing do with them. And of course when we left, instead of just going down 3 floors I had to go all the back down out and around again. It's not the walk that bothers me, just the total lack of information and respect for their customers. They may well have some security issues or similar but there is a key card system in the lift they could use or even just someone to help out and explain would be a start. Or how about a sign? It just shows me that the leadership team of this hotel have totally lost sight of their customers and are happy to put their frontline staff in the front line of a patently silly policy. Neither are good.Also on check in, I was asked for my email address. I asked why and was told it was for the wifi login. The next day I got a spam email from the Standard. Again no big deal but shows how the hotels regards its customers. This really tainted my visit and the uber-cool nature of the hotel just felt more arrogant and unwelcoming after that. The Rooftop is not really as great or exclusive as they like to think it isGiven the fact it's pretty expensive - $500 a night and the disdain with which the leadership team of the hotel treats its customerss, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon,","Hertford, United Kingdom",32,3.0

Second, a really horrible, unwelcoming, dark and noisy lobby area followed by a lift you can’t find and when you get in it it’s so dark you can’t tell which button to push. Third no storage at all - a tiny hanging space, nothing more. Fourth, the bathroom is a joke - see through walls, tiny space. Fifth, for a hip hotel how about a usb point next to the bed?

Or is it the amenities and carefully yet elegantly designed rooms? The state-of-the-art gym (open 24/7) with dimly lit lights (see my pics to see what I mean!) that offer breathtaking views of NYC located on the 17th floor, the 24-hour room service, the fully stocked mini-bar, the rooms with wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Hudson River, Italian bedding and down pillows, or the elevator that has a video collage with a depiction of heaven, hell, and purgatory created by video artist Marco Brambilla, that will make you question if you have left reality and entered into another dimension? No, that isn't why this place is so sought after and is regarded as one of the best, most chic hotels around. It is the people and service.

The demands are great, the reward or recognition of services rendered I can only imagine are far and few between, and this is expected 24/7, no matter what happens, whether their fault or not. I am going out of my way to deliberately mention several people that made my stay not just memorable but enjoyable, so much so that I have been telling my friends and colleagues that this is the place to be. Jade - she was the first person I was greet by at this hotel. She was kind, welcoming, had a sense of humor, and ensured I had a easy check-in under rather tight circumstances. I extended my one day stay into a three day stay and it all started with her. Melinda - Extremely helpful, accommodating, understanding, and was able to balance my requests along with numerous other guests at the same time, while making you feel special, instead of being ignored. Not an easy feat to accomplish, with so much going on at once.Phillip Charles - Sometimes, you want to talk to someone who will give it to you straight. He is someone who has a sense of humor, is authentic, professional, and treats you the same whether you are a celebrity or John Doe. That is rare to find and its the way it should be. Kevin - In the back office, honored my rate several times, pushed back checkout several times, all with speed and efficiency and gave a great breakdown of charges.

I will give u the upgrade room"" but not a word of apology. Very unprofessional manner.6. The upgraded room was completely the same as the former one but nobody inside.7. The transparent bathroom (literally mean it) is very slippery because of the type of tiles; also at night when someone have to go in to the bathroom and must turn on light, it would have irritated the others.8.The edge of the bedside hang bar is poorly designed with sharp edge; prone to hit you at the head anytime.9. There is no storage space for your baggage in the room. No amenities at all.10. There is no towel bar nor towel ring in the bathroom except a tiny one at the door; almost like a tiny door knob.11.

To begin with the side of the tub/shower is clear glass so that everything is clearly visible from the sleeping area. While the toilet area has its own room, if someone turns on a light over the sink at night it lights up the bedroom. The bed and seating area are about 16 inches off the floor, making it difficult for older folks to get up. There are no towel racks for hanging wet towels. One is left puzzling over what to do with them. The bed is pushed up against an outside wall on one side with no bedside stand on that side of the bed. Many of the public areas and elevators are poorly lit. There is one small bulb in the elevators with the result that you cannot read the floor numbers. We literally went to the wrong floor twice because we could not see the correct numbers. What were the designers thinking? And then there is the black bar soap. It turns the sink black, leaves black under your nails, etc. see below. And then there is the solar film that was placed on the windows and has now badly wrinkled distorting the view out the window. At these prices they could do better. ","Chevy Chase, Maryland",47,3.0

However, the Standard in New York fell short of my expectation. Stayed in the Hudson Studio room on the 7th floor. While the room and view are nice, it is extremely loud and uncomfortable. The sound from the club make it unbearable to sleep at night. Called the front desk to complain but they weren’t able to do much. Had i known about the loud sound, i would ask to be moved before unpacking my stuff and getting situated in what i thought would be high standard environment. Same with the pillow, asked for a foam pillow, but got a feather. The price i paid for my room doesn’t match up to my experience i expecting to recieved. Would not recommend staying at this hotel if you are looking for comfort. This hotel is good for the view and the area. But a good night sleep is a huge no.

The area couldn’t be better.Our check in, I felt was very rushed. It wasn’t as if there were many people waiting to check in. I guess typical American style check in, fast and furious. I did ask a question concerning how to log in to the Wi-fi. I was given the answer, “family name and room number” I stay in many hotels world wide and asked which password we used. The check in lady repeated the family name and room number. I guess she was still in her speedy check in mode and wanted me out of the lobby. I left quietly muttering. The rooms themselves are comfortable with great views. We booked a suite with the river view. We got what we asked for. I do have to say at this point that the hotel have used some great trick photography when it come down to the size of the room. It is a suite and made to look double the size in the pictures than it actually was. The hotel is very chic and has a boutique feel. It has good amenities in the room and a fully stocked bar and fridge. The hanging space is very limited though. I still don’t get the shower room. It has one small light that I can only assume is for mood lighting. I would suggest you bring a torch with you, should you want to shower in the evening. We have tried 2 restaurant/bars in the hotel. The first was the Standard Grill. I can only say hugely disappointing. I had read very mixed reviews on this restaurant. All I can say, awful service. Very very slow. Food was very average. I had a Bloody Mary which didn’t have any vodka in. We watched two tables of 6 leave due to the poor and slow service. I won’t be going back.We also tried the bar at the top of the hotel called Top of the Standard. Totally the opposite. Excellent service, great food and a great view.

Initial allocation of room was poir- looked out onto a building site in clise proximity but after intervention of our daughter in law we were moved to a room with a city/river view which was much lighter and brighter too. We were on the 12th floor and whilst we were aware of some background noise it didn’t distract us. The room size wasn’t bad for New York and we got used to the open plan bathroom! I had worried that the steam from the shower would cause dampness in the bedding or our clothes (no wardrobe- just a hanging rail behind a curtain) but the air- com seemed to help with that.

She had stayed there before a few years back celebrating her 25th birthday and as I have heard countless times it was an experience of a lifetime for her... This event stayed with her for years as one of her most cherished memories. I can only describe the service we received from the staff as we arrived as the friendliest, most amazing and coolest ever!!!! You can tell when people are friendly because they have to (That’s their job) or because they are genuinely that way... The front desk personnel Marco Yauri and Erin not only greeted us with the friendliest smile and willingness to serve, but with the outmost professional and warmest positive energy and stellar customer service I’ve encountered in all my travels. When my girlfriend told Marco about her past experience at the hotel he and the other guys went to the back of the counter and worked their magic (Yes... It was short from real magic) as they were able to upgrade our stay to the FREAKING EMPIRE SUITE!!!!! One of the coolest, baddest, most amazing rooms in the hotel!!! The same room my girlfriend had the best birthday ever!!! We couldn’t believe it... I still can’t believe it... It was beyond amazing!!! My girlfriend started screaming and dancing... It was awesome! I could go on and on about how majestic that room is... The view... The style, the decor, the amenities, the attention to detail, It was the coolest experience I can remember!!

I was pretty disappointed. The most positive things about our stay were the service and the location. The location is awesome – blocks away from the Whitney, the High Line, and the Chelsea Market. We also had meals at the Standard Grill and the Top of the Standard. Both were pretty good.  The staff here were friendly and very accommodating. Shout out to Nico. If it weren't for him, we probably would have asked to move hotel when we arrived.  The negatives: -Room and cleanliness.  The first day when we arrived, we learned that the A/C was not working at full capacity, and it wouldn’t be fixed for a day. Nico was nice enough to locate us in a room with A/C that was partly working, and sent up some waters to the room. However, when I picked up the water glass I was disgusted by how dirty it was. It wasn’t like a small water stain, but it looked used and unwashed. There were even lip prints all over the side of the glass. We booked the deluxe king room with River view. It ended up being pretty small. The room was very humid and the carpet felt damp. There were ZERO hooks inside the room to hang our towels which was odd and inconvenient. As one could imagine – It was quite miserable to stay in a room that was hot and muggy. I ended up with a massive headache my first night and when I tried to locate some Advil through the hotel at 2:30am, I was told I had to go to a store outside to find it. -Gym: One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was for its gym. I researched hotels with good gyms, and the Standard was on the top 10 list. Needless to say, I was surprised to find out how outdated it was. We couldn’t get much of a workout since it was so hot inside the gym. Even after the A/C was fixed on our second day there was still no air circulating inside the gym. A few windows were cracked for air, but they wouldn’t stay open, unless you propped them open with a towel. The gym's equipment was outdated and worn, and they don’t even offer filtered water machines like most hotel gyms. Instead, they have an old school water fountain. I wish I could say that we enjoyed our stay, but we really didn’t. It was a letdown in many aspects.","San Francisco, California",37,3.0

The only thing odd was about the room was the sink was located in the same space as the shower so after taking a shower your feet are gonna get wet if you later go in to wash your hands or brush your teeth.

Their was a sound that you could hear coming through the wall that sounded like a bird was stuck in it, after listening more we are pretty sure it was just the elevator room next to our room, possibly why they supply a set of earplugs.

They have a psychedelic video playing. At first I thought the layout was a bit odd but it worked out well. It had a quirky and sophisticated take on their design. I like that the room included an umbrella. It was raining most of the time. Guest have an option to buy it. There had been lightning and thunderstorms on our wedding day that when we opened the umbrella, there were lightning prints inside it! We liked it immediately and bought it. It was great that the hotel has a restaurant and a cafe which served great food. We ate there twice, one at lunch time and one at breakfast time. Prices were reasonable. If you plan to stay here for a few days, and you like art, it's a stones throw away from The Whitney. The High Line park is great if you want to stroll on a sunny weekday.

Bright yellow revolving doors, red signs, a beautiful outdoor eating area and a retro chic lobby catch your eye before you make it to the super trippy elevator and gorgeously outfitted rooms. When i arrived to the hotel I was greeted by Kevin, the Front Desk Agent; we were two hours early for check in but he found a room and checked us in all within five minutes. The rooms are gorgeous, the rooftop bar has a stunning view, Le Bain (while not my favorite music) is something that everyone should visit, etc. There is nothing this hotel was lacking. Thank you, Kevin for safely storing my bags and for letting me hangout in the lobby for almost two hours while I got my life together, haha. Overall it was a great stay and I would gladly do it again.",,1,5.0

I highly recommend going to the sky club upstairs and taking in the beautiful views of the city. The location is great and easy to grab the subway or a taxi to go to the other boroughs.The rooms were very comfortable and had a beautiful modern design. The only thing I would mention is the shower is wide open to the bedroom with clear glass.

I kinda liked the feel of the neighborhood though very hipster and raw and new at the same time simply different I guess!I had a nightmare checking in as there was a queue to check in and then I was asked for a deposit on my pre-paid room, I offered cash but it was not acceptable apparently and I needed a card since my card was international I had issues so they refused to check me in until my card passed! Finally they blocked 500 usd on my card for a 5 night stay and then checked me in! My bags thankfully were taken to my room but the concierge gave me attitude as I probably didn’t get the chance to tip him! I was real hungry and actually starving having travelled for 10 hours and looked at the menu in the room which is beyond limited and half of the food is not available all the time so decided to go downstairs! I ended up in the brasserie restaurant cause it was either that or sandwich’s and landed up paying over 130 usd for a meal I would pay 50 usd outside! But atleast I got food! Went back upstairs to notice that even water was charged in the room the hotel didn’t even offer complimentary water with the room and mind you the rooms aren’t cheap!The next morning I woke up and ordered breakfast which was beyond normal and also overpriced! The laundry too! The housekeeper wouldn’t make my room everyday until the late afternoon and when I would come exhausted I would need to leave my room so it could be made!The hotel is not close to anything if you visiting for tourism so be prepared to pay high amounts if you want to travel by taxi and the staff at reception are not helpful at all!Laundry services are expensive and overpriced even for a nyc hotel!One night I forgot my key and wallet in the room and went for a cigarette with my phone the reception wouldn’t let me into my own room even after confirmation of everything and I was even carrying my mobile and they had my passport copy so could have verified the pic! Strange! in the end after a long time I requested that security escort me to the room and then see if it’s mine! And finally that happened which was not easy either!I’m sure as most of my experiences the hotel will apologize without any compensation and I would be asked to spend my money again so they can fix the issues sorry if hotel management really feel bad they should provide complimentary stats to customers to correct the wrong doings! I would never recommend this hotel to anyone especially if your in nyc for tourism!","Doha, Qatar",27,3.0

We commiserated for a short bit of how she is a twin as well, and I commended her mother for having survived the beautiful but trying experience. Melinda must have taken heart to me because she said she would send wine to my room and what did I prefer? Expecting a glass of wine to arrive, I was completely blown away when she came up herself to deliver a bottle of red. I was flabbergasted--so much so that I forgot to tip her (not that she made any indication that she was expecting one). So, the best I can do to express my gratitude is to write this review. Incidentally, I ordered room service twice. The delivery was quick, the servers were friendly, the food delicious.

After explaining my plans, John told me he had a space for me that would most likely be open the day I wanted to propose. He sent me an email 10 minutes after our call with links to flower vendors, balloon vendors... and also looped in the events planner Joe Harris (talk about a quick response). WOW, WOW, WOW, the entire team made our weekend at The Standard unforgettable. Joe and many others helped setup the most amazing proposal in their Highline room and we were blown away by the detail and effort they put into this. Keep in mind, that I did not expect them to be so invested in my proposal, but they were there for every detail and made us feel sooooo spacial and welcomed. There were so many small details that Joe and the team did not have to do, but did which made our experience the most memorable. Joe and the team setup the room with all the candles, flowers, rose pedals, music and balloons I ordered and set the mood with dim lighting and even played my playlist of songs right when I opened the door to the Highline room. I probably told Joe and the team thank you 500 times because there is no way I could have pulled off such a cool proposal without them. Not to mention, they had a magazine event at The Top of The Standard that night and the hotel was busy in general.

I was searching for a hotel that was close to the Google offices so my husband could work and I could relax while he was working. I also wanted to be able to walk to stores and restaurants. I also needed a hotel with a fully equipped gym. The Standard met all of my requirements. Melinda S. helped us with check in. We asked for a quiet room since my husband would have to get up early in the morning. We had booked a King Deluxe overlooking the Hudson. The views were incredible with The Highline to the left of us and the Hudson directly in front of us. The room was funky and quaint. The only downside was very little closet space however there was plenty of space under the table and bench seating. I just repacked my suitcase and tucked it away. There was a closet bar in the bathroom for anything that I did not want to wrinkle. The room was so quiet I slept in very late the first morning. I had read reviews of noise from the nightclub. However we were placed on the 12th floor and had no issues. We were pretty hungry by the time we arrived and grabbed a delicious sandwich and bowl of soup at the skating chalet that was attached to the hotel. While we were eating one of the staff members walked by and we had a few questions about things to do in the area. She spent quite a bit of time telling us about the area and nearby things to do. She was very helpful. Our food was in range of typical NY prices but it was worth it. The next morning was snowing so I did not want to step out of the hotel so I grabbed a bite in the cafe at the hotel and had the prettiest drink and tasty frittatta. I then went in search of the fitness center. It was on the 17th floor and very clean. There were quite a few machines as well as spin bikes, free weights, treadmills and elliptical machines. I was practically the only person in the gym the entire week. Plus the views in the gym were as nice as our room. One of the perks of staying there and using the gym is that they washed your gym clothes for free. You just had to have it to them before 12pm and they would have it back before 5pm. A very nice perk in my opinion. They did not have water bottles but there was a water fountain right near the restrooms. I had read of this beforehand and brought my own water bottle. Melanie S. remembered us the next evening when we went back and inquired about our stay so far. She also comped us two drink tickets to the Biergarten that was at the back of the property. We spent most of our evenings there. The beer was tasty and the portions were quite large.  There was a game room behind the main room and we played shuffleboard and other bar games while enjoying our beer. Every single staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make sure our stay was a good one. And they seemed very happy to do it. I did not feel like they were just faking it like some hotel employees do. They genuinely cared about our comments and answered all of our questions. We went upstairs to check out The Top of the Standard and I felt we were very under-dressed even for a happy hour drink. The hostess was very friendly and told us to just have a seat. She didn't look down on us for not being dressed up. I would definitely stay here again. We got a corporate rate so I felt that our stay was worth the price. I would add that this hotel is preferred for adults/couples ,I don't think families with children would be comfortable here.","Campbell, California",10,5.0

The rest of our three days was pretty much looking at this hotel ""fully committed"" to the thousand of early 20's squad that came in from outside hotels to party it up at their disco at night and outdoor roof area during the day. We attempted to have a drink on the rooftop area but found it was sitting on the concrete floor room only. No room for someone looking for an afternoon Moscow Mule among the red bull/ shot takers/ pot smokers sitting on the concrete floor up there. The smell was horrific up there. There was an alternative indoor cocktail room, but alas we were not accepted there due to the fact that I was not dressed in proper dress attire. I was wearing open toes sandals, flip flops. I have never been a guest at a hotel to have the privilege of being turned away from the bar for inappropriate attire. It was kind of sad to not have a drink available at the hotel.  There was no coffee maker in the room, which made mornings pretty memorable. Long walks to find coffee at local shops or either getting dressed to make the way to the cafe downstairs. This was also negative fun. Getting coffee should not be difficult and expensive ($17 for room service to bring it up and a long wait.)

The answer is yes. Because it is in a beautiful place, because it offers an extraordinary view at any time of day or night, because it has the charm of the trendy place, because the rooms (choose the bigger ones if you can because the Standard Queen are a bit claustrophobic: better the Corner Kings...). However, the staff who believe that being cool means being rude and disorganized, a continuous procession of losers aspiring to be influencers who create traffic in the lobby and elevators to reach the legendary rooftop bar, two poor quality restaurants, prevent this hotel to earn the gallons of the luxury hotel and to deserve consideration for any of the soft aspects it offers. In short: the beautiful rooms with windows overlooking NY and the Hudson even when you take a shower, the design certainly nice and the architecture underline how the attractiveness of this place (and the only reasons to come) are exclusively of ""hard"" type. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to the soft aspects, you want to be pampered and you like a muffled environment in which to live an experience made of elements such as the attention of the staff, an impeccable service and perhaps with a quality restaurant, orient your choices elsewhere.

Robes are dope, but don't steal them cause they will charge for 100 something bucks for it. Nightlife much better than the Dream, and Gansevoort. Easily stay at the Standard over those two.

Everything was smooth, but a few things really left a sour taste in my mouth. First of all, I want to give a huge thank you to Stephanie. She checked us in and was amazing. Her excitement and customer service made us feel happy to be there. We were even upgraded to a King corner Room and the view was AMAZING. Thank you, Stephanie! The only unsettling and upsetting thing Is that the sheets were disgusting. They had stains on them and it looked like housekeeping was trying to hide that by flipping the pillows over out of sheer laziness. It was too noticeable for them to miss that while cleaning the room. You guys have to do better. My last issue is with one of the customer service reps that answered the phones. I wish I got her name, but rather than being polite her response when i said hello was “what is it that you Need.” If you’re unhappy with your life or hate what you do, there’s always an opportunity to change it. The people you hire reflects tremendously on the hotel and it’s treatment of others. Whether I’d stay there again or not, is debatable. ","Long Island, New York",7,3.0

Got an instant upgrade with check-in. Upgraded to a beautiful corner room with floor to ceiling windows and essentially a panoramic view of the city. Room was very clean. Shower also had a great view of the city. It was well-stocked with towels and we never came close to running out. Décor of room was edgy (see website), and we had a great time hosting our guests. We stayed there for our anniversary and they dropped off a complimentary bottle of champagne for us. The hotel was in a great location (Meatpacking district). Many upscale shops right across the street. Chelsea Market has great food options and is within a 10 minute walk. The hotel also had a gym with 2 peleton bikes on the 17th floor and 2 rooftop bars (both of which are pretty nice with amazing views). The hotel also has a restaurant downstairs, as well as a spacious beer garden with ping pong tables and other pub games. Food was okay, nothing superb. We had a late dinner at Standard Grill and the prices were costly and the food was average. We did enjoy the dollar oysters happy hour special from 4-5:30PM on weekdays. There were no drink specials but the bartenders were friendly. Some issues we ran into (not necessarily the hotel’s fault):- I forgot to bring contact solution, had to go to CVS late at night.- We tried to bring some more guests up to our room, but after a certain time of night, they were pretty firm on “no more than 2 guests can come up to visit your room,” which was a bummer, but understandable from a noise control standpoint.Front desk was otherwise responsive and helpful. On our way home, we were running close on time, and the front desk was quickly able to get us in a taxi and on our way. Would definitely recommend it if you can afford it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",3,4.0

Long story short, our flight was cancelled and we ended up back at the Standard after checking out earlier in the day. We were a bit bedraggled...but ready to enjoy an unexpected night in NYC. We arrived back at the front desk, and Stephanie's eyes lit up in a way that only spells mischief...and she squeaked with excitement at the news that we were being upgraded to a room she was unwilling to describe. She wanted it to be a surprise. Marco reeled when Stephanie showed him where we were headed. We were a little nervous...but pretty excited too. Needless to say, when we walked into a double suite, with panoramic views of the river and the city...marble everywhere...suede couches, TVs, 2 bathrooms, fully stocked real-size bar, soaker tub overlooking the city view...our jaws quite literally dropped. Stephanie...what have you done?! We'll never be able to stay in NYC without comparing to this totally special experience. And you made it happen! As though that wasn't enough, Ms Sassafras herself came up to share in our shock and awe...and brought us some Prosecco like we were visiting Royalty from Canada! We gushed over the room and thanked her beyond thanks!We bought a Powerball ticket next...hoping our luck might extend a titch further :) The entire stay at the Standard (we were there a few nights prior in a Corner King room) were also excellent. The views are amazing. The area is fun to be in. We LOVE the lounge on the 18th floor -and the staff treated us beautifully, despite us actually not being in the glitterati circles.

As was the ridiculously comfortable bed and hooded robe (love!). I'm a total product snob and the custom formula Davines hair and body products are fantastic. So fantastic I'm ordering the Shampoo and Conditioner (that's a first). The staff is eclectic but inviting and all very accommodating, the hotel restaurant Standard Grill absolutely delish, my fiancé had the best mussels ever and the shop is surprisingly well curated with local designers and items you'll actually want to buy.

He loves The Standard and though I’d never been his opinion alone had me sold. When we arrived our room wasn’t ready but we were given free beer vouchers for the nearby Biergarten (score). We treated ourselves to a lunch at The Standard Grill (highly recommend their assortments of meats and cheeses, it’s a lot like mischplatte) until we were called and told our room was available.Unfortunately when we arrived at our room we found that we had a (still beautiful) view of the cityscape instead of the Hudson as specifically requested. Though he debated on mentioning it, my boyfriend called down and inquired as to why we weren’t given our original room. We were told the previous guest had smoked in the (nonsmoking) room and left burns in the carpet, leaving the room unavailable for use! Bummer! However, The Standard demonstrated their excellent customer service skills. We were introduced to Alexander from Guest Experience management (I’m probably butchering the department name, apologies) and escorted to a gorgeous contemporary penthouse suite! Needless to say we were incredibly surprised and though the suite was still facing the city we couldn’t have been more grateful and satisfied.For my first experience at The Standard it was beyond amazing!

It definitely felt different during the day time LOL since I have been here so many times but only after dark. We first went to check out The Top of The Standard. Well, I was trying to take a picture for Instagram. But I was turned away because I was wearing sneakers. I had explained I was a hotel guest and was doing a staycation so I did not pack anything fancy, and asked if I could just go take a picture real quick. Unfortunately, the answer was no. So I want to explain, you know how some people have great ""street style"" that they pair their sneakers up with a nice jack/coat? Well, I was wearing a pretty fancy long coat from Tibi. I thought it was stylish but well, what do i know right? And the most ridiculous part was that, this angry looking guy let two people wearing jeans and white sneakers in. So I truly did not understand. But guess what, I took a nice picture through the door and got featured by Beautiful Hotels. Interesting turn of events but still does not help me understand their pretentiousness. Then we went to Le Bain. Apparently, you were not allowed to get into the elevator with a jacket or coat. Unfortunately, i was wearing a tank under my jacket... Again, staycation error i suppose. I asked if I could just go in and take a picture real quick and then leave, and of course the answer was no. So yea i was frozen to death and the place reeked!!! No wonder I always had a good time going there after dark, because I was never sober there before. But everything sure is different under the broad daylight. And the view? Meh. I have seen better. It was just not worth the cold.We loved the neighborhood so we did not complain about the stay. But honestly, I would never stay there again, at least not when I am sober... The whole lobby smelled horrible and there were way too many drunk people (non guests mainly) shouting and bumping into you. Just not my type of scene when I want a nice staycation. The most frustrating part is that the hotel treats the paying hotel guests no different than people who go there to get drunk. Sure, working in the hospitality gives me very high standard for service. But I also am very reasonable. I understand The Standard is a ""party hotel"", but when you pay to stay there, don't you want to be treated at least a little different than non paying guests? I have done so many staycations in the city at boutique and luxury hotels, never once I had felt like an outcast. And yes i have stayed at many hotels with vibrant nightlife scenes (eg Dream Downtown and PUBLIC etc and they made me feel so special). So yea I would never stay there again. Would I recommend it to my friends? Well if they plan to party all night there then go right ahead. It's the perfect place because they would not likely to remember anything anyway...We checked out yesterday and today, my boyfriend got a $28 charge for an umbrella we never used. COME ON... And an extra $2 charge for the Highline park renovation... Well, next time, maybe we will accept the $2 charge if you tell us upon check-in.","New York City, New York",3,3.0

He went above and beyond and even surprised me by gifting me cake and champagne in celebration of my birthday.The Room: well firstly on top of Freddy providing me with a comfortable room. I spoke with Regina and she gave me even more of an upgrade for my stay. With fantastic views, space and a beautiful full sized tub to relax in. When I arrived I was greeted by Stephanie! We totally vibe energetically and she kicked off my stay with the absolute right attitude: chill, relatable and real. I was already excited but she made me reassured from the beginning that this was the place to be. Kay at concierge was so sweet and helpful to suggest fun things to do from the Biergarten to ice skating and the Top of the Standard! I felt like I could really be entertained in just one night. The staff overall were all lovely especially Zack who personally brought me my treats and Sam who I bugged on the phone several times and all those in housekeeping.And lastly Shawn was so helpful with storing and handling my luggage after my check out! He was friendly with great personable conversation and he even escorted me upstairs after I had forgotten something in my room. Overall the stay was beyond what I could imagine and that was because of the vision and work of Freddy and the rest of the team at the Standard. Brava!

It's the sort of hotel that makes you feel like they are doing you a favour by letting you stay - too cool for school kind of attitude. The staff in the restaurant and indeed the restaurant itself was great. The bar at the top was quite another story. If you want to sit down at any table in the bar you have to book - whether or not you are staying at the hotel - as their ""members"" get priority and even on a Sunday night when it was half-full and we wanted a 7pm table we were told we couldn't have one until 7.30 which was a bit odd. The rooms are small but clean, although there is no-where to put clothes, apart from 4 hangers - no drawers anywhere. We stayed with them for three nights, on our last night the lock on our door broke and we were forced to move rooms; no-ones fault, these things happen, and we were thrilled to be moved to one of the corner suites on the 6th floor, we had been in a small room on the 8th floor. The view from the suite wasn't nearly as good but the room was larger and had a great bath in it, all lovely you might think. The noise coming from the night-club on the top floor was just shocking in this different part of the hotel. We had boom, boom, boom until 4am so no sleep. I complained the following morning when we checked-out and they were kind enough to give us a small amount off the bill but even so, I don't think we will be returning. If someone were to ask me, I would suggest one night at this place is quite fun, it's a sexy hotel. I am baffled as to why anyone would take a child and I saw quite a few children which made me feel quite uncomfortable. In the lifts there are various videos being played, one of which was quite sexually explicit.","London, United Kingdom",12,3.0

I had to get to the airport to catch a flight, but it was a frustrating end to the stay. I mentioned it to the front desk upon departure, so hopefully the next guest doesn't have the same issue - just wish I hadn't! (The front desk asked why I hadn't called down about it and that they would have fixed it - given that they did fix a burned out light promptly the night before I believe them, but I didn't have the extra 5-10 min to spare that morning).

I know I’m a bit late writing this review but here goes... I surprised my husband for his birthday. We stayed in the Hudson Studio. The view was absolutely fabulous!!! I had surprises at various times during our trip. The concierges Kay, John, Erin, and Colleen ALL helped discreetly in preparing every detail and having it go so smoothly. They answered every question and request immediately. I had planned minor requests as hot chocolate to the luxurious in-room couples massages. It was as if we were in “Neverland”. We wanted time to stand still and indulge in every moment. We happened to stay while the weather was 50 degrees in JANUARY! (1/20-1/21)We walked mid-afternoon the High Line and brought back take out from Chelsea Market. Later in the evening we enjoyed what seemed to be privately ice skating at their rink and relaxing under their heated seating area. Of course we traded in our skates for dancing shoes and hit up Le Bain. The next morning we pampered ourselves with a delicious breakfast at the Grill. It truly was a remarkable overnight getaway. I am THANKFUL to the whole concierge team because without their knowledge and support, I would have been lost in making my husbands birthday a memorable one for years to come.

Overall, our experience was good. The staff was friendly and efficient; small problems were taken care of promptly. The food, service and ambience at the Grill were excellent, and prices were moderate. The buzzy, crowded scene here not exactly our game as two 80-year olds, but kind of fun for our younger family and us as well. The rooms were problematic, seemingly designed by a deranged midget. Bed so low it was not easy to rise; layout and fixtures in some bathrooms were bizarre. The clearance between spout and basin in our sink was less than 3 inches: impossible to fill a water glass, and I have bloody hands from trying to shave. (Not an exaggeration: Standard folk, check it out, room 611.) Our rooms were all quite small although mitigated by floor to ceiling windows and great Hudson River views (if you have one). Minimal storage for clothing, would not be great for a long stay. Location is perfect, away from the crowds of midtown but with plenty to do and fine restaurants close by. Whitney Museum and High Line next door. West Village sure has changed since we lived here 47 years ago.","West Cornwall, Connecticut",37,3.0

It looks so cool and majestic sitting there on the Highline in the Meatpacking district. I booked a corner room for about $732/night and insisted on a corner room with a tub. Service upon arriving at the hotel was sub par. Front desk staff was minimally helpful. Took elevator up to our high floor room. Hallways look cheap with rubber cove base running along the bottom of walls wear the carpet meets. Bright fluorescent lighting like in a dorm. Our room had the most amazing view. It was very small. Bed was comfy, but nightstands were flimsy and weak. Bathroom sink too shallow and small. Tub was nice and big. Great place to sit and look at the city and watch the snow fall. Great view of the Empire State Building. No complimentary coffee maker so you have to pay $16 to have them deliver 2 cups worth to your room. Room was tiny for the price which is ok with me but the quality in general was sub standard and everything looked a little worn out. Gym was fantastic with a great view of the river. The restaurants downstairs were great for young adults who want to see other young kids, but for my wife and I who are used to more sophistication we found it to be hectic and kind of like a college hangout. The hotel feels like it’s run by a bunch of college kids. I don’t think I will stay here again. Had to try it but not worth the price in my opinion.

Very cool & modern, lobby could use a little refreshing. Room was very trendy, typical size for NY. Awesome bathtub, but not the stand alone tub we requested. View from the room was amazing. water-closet, no fan. Shower/sink/bathtub all in 1 room with no door. No trash can either. 1 minor flaw, no soap, just shower gel (even for your hands) that smelled strongly of dryer sheets or men's cologne. Very strong. Almost offensive. Great bluetooth speaker by bed. small dinette. Great room service. Wish there was a guide to the hotel in the room. We weren't sure where the ""cool"" bar was, where breakfast was served that came with our package or where restaurant was located. We asked & explored. We still don't know what was in the basement! Cool french restaurant in front of hotel & a very cozy restaurant inside. Decorated for the holidays. The expense of the lighting in the hotel must be incredible! Small Skating rink out front.

The hotel itself is very artsy and intriguing and I loved that about it. Check-in went smoothly. I was prepared for a small room as my fiance warned me that it's NYC and not to expect much, so the room was understandably smaller than what I am used to. The room was decorated nicely and with such a small space, I can understand the configuration of the shower/vanity/toilet. The view was pretty, etc. etc. Our room was on the 9th floor and we could hear the club in the hotel, though it was just a dull bass, nothing necessarily to keep me up with earplugs in (provided by the hotel). But my BIGGEST complaint was on the night of my 30th birthday, a Friday night, when we tried to go to the 18th floor bar and the doorman told us that it was for MEMBERS ONLY and sent us away. Guests of the hotel get sent away from an empty club?! The concierge then told us we could go to La Bain BUT it would be doorman's discretion whether or not we could get in? Like, are we not pretty enough or fancy enough? ""Luckily "" we were allowed in to La Bain, which was 100% empty at 11 pm on a Friday night.

During the day we walked the highland, visited the Whitney museum and had the opportunity to check out local artists and shops. I was especially thankful for the kind and informative front desk staff. Niko, in particular, was amazing! He gave us some great suggestions for exactly what we were looking for.

I was visiting family with my wife and decided to stay out one night in the city. We decided on the Standard because we wanted drinks on their bar up top. At check-in, Diede was quick and informative but gave us the bad news and told us the bar up top was closed due to a private event but she quickly referred me to Colleen their concierge. In no time she referred me to two other rooftops in the area. There is a funky video in the elevator and the room was gorgeous! A little tight on space but which NYC hotel isn't. The bathtub was a little clunky but we are more shower people anyway so it was okay. At checkout, Kevin at the front desk even reminded me I had my home keys which I hadn't and had left in my room.

By way of background, we are from Sydney Australia, in our late 20's / early 30's and like to eat, drink (and she likes to shop).The hotel itself was fantastic - unbeatable location, but more on that later.What really made our trip, the trip of a lifetime, was the the concierge team at the hotel who were absolutely amazing. I planned my engagement in our suite with them and they were unbelievably helpful. Months before I'd even checked in, they were providing me with assistance on everything from booking helicopters, getting helium balloons, champagne and rose petals organised for our room, arranging hire cars and reserving tables at restaurants and bars for us. They put together the most memorable engagement I could have ever hoped for (I'm certain that it helped get my fiancee over the line to say ""yes""). Throughout our stay they continued to bend over backwards to help us get reservations at amazing restaurants, front row seats at fashion week shows and even an impossible-to-get private VIP tattoo booking with JonBoy during fashion week.To Erin, thank you for being our personal concierge for the time we stayed and to the rest of the concierge team, Colleen, John and Kaheen, we cannot thank you enough for going out of your way for us and making our trip so memorable. We truly felt like we were part of the family by the time we left.Now to the hotel itself. You couldn't ask for a better location - right in the middle of the action in meatpacking, and easy to get up to mid-down, up-down and down to lower Manhattan. There are an abundance of great venues to eat and drink at both within and around the hotel - The Standard Grill, in particular, is fantastic.The rooms are fantastic. We upgraded to a Hudson Studio Suite which I understand are the most popular suites. We felt like we were right on the Hudson river, with floor to ceiling windows on three sides of the room, we had views up and down the entire river, all the way to the Statue of Liberty.Cannot recommend highly enough - the only place to stay in the city.We will be back, hopefully sooner rather than later!",,0,5.0

It was my 12th time at this hotel. Prior to this stay, I was there for 10 days in September, 2017. I’ve been seen the decline in the service of this hotel, but nothing was compared to this last time. The problems started from begging, since I have booked a room with river view and ended up in a room with no river view. The explanation at the check in was that the hotel was very busy and the only rooms left were without river view, without options, I accepted. There were nobody to help me with my bags, the hall was chaotic (I check in around 9PM). I thought that would be my only problems, but I was very wrong. From the start the heating didn’t work, I tried calling but after 45 minutes trying and no answer I had to go downstairs to ask someone to fix it. Since I was late they said they would send someone the next day. Next day came nobody showed and I called again. This time someone came and fixed the problem, only for it to malfunction the next day again. In my forth day after many visits from maintenance the problem was solved. But there were far worse problems. Every single day that I left the hotel at night, even at 7PM, there were people selling drugs openly in front of the hotel entrance, they even approached us offering all kinds of drugs. Every time that happened we informed hotel security and front desk, they asked us who were doing, we showed, and surprised, they did nothing, because we stayed close to see what happened and, not once, someone approached them, or told the to leave, or called the police, NOT ONCE. When it happened while we were coming back to the hotel we looked from the window to see if the hotel would take any action, but hours would go by and the hotel did absolutely nothing. I have never witnessed it before, but this time there were construction next to the entrance of the night club and the dealers changed their place (that was said very calmly from a lady in the check in counter). I really don’t want to stay in a hotel that believes this kind of things are normal. Coming and going from the hotel felt very insecure, but nobody cared. But the icing on the cake happened on Saturday (Nov, 11th). Since our flight was late at night, I paid the room until November, 12th, but for some reason I don’t know the hotel system had our check out date at November, 11th. We left the room to lunch and when we came back our keys were not working, so we went to the check in counter again, a very aggressive man told us that the keys were not working because we were supposed to have left at 12PM and it was 2PM. He went on to say how we were causing trouble to the guests that were going to occupy our room, since they had already arrived to the hotel and were waiting for us to vacate the room. We explained that our reservation was for the check out on November, 12th, he doubted and we showed the reservation. He asked for a minute, took my phone to his manager and came back saying we were right ang gave us new key. No apologies, no sympathy, nothing, gave the keys, said the day was busy and asked us to go. We left the hotel and came back to pick up our luggage and go to the airport. The keys, again, didn’t work, but, at least, this time, they gave us the key without complaint. We trying calling someone to pick up our luggage but once again nobody picked the phone at front desk or luggage. My boyfriend went downstairs and asked someone to pick it up. I was in the room when the guy came. He came with no cart. I said that he could pick up the luggage e take it downstairs, but I would stay at the room because I was had some things to do. He pretended that he didn’t listen to me, entered the room, put all my luggage in the hallway, the lady from housekeeping that was knocking on the door every 5 minutes even with the do not disturb sigh the door entered the room, the guy went through all the things inside the room and basically kicked me out of the room. He radio someone saying that the problem was solved, that front desk could tell the guests waiting for the room that it would be ready in 10 minutes. I payed for that night, I had the right to stay. It was 3PM. It was disrespectful and unacceptable. Since I was kicked out I went to the check in counter to check out and informed what had just happened. The lady said she would inform her superior and see if it was possible not to charge me for the extra night I payed, but could not use. She explained that the hotel was very busy because there were lots of events at the hotel that day. And that is a guest problem why? If you don’t have the capacity to do that many events at once, don’t do it. Once we check out we had to wait almost 1 hour to have our luggage. The luggage carts were there, but there were no one to carry it. We offered to pick up the bags (that stayed more than 1h in the hallway pf the 12th floor), but they informed us we couldn’t use the cart. So we waited. In the check out we were promised that everything we said were going to be passed on to the superiors and the hotel was going to contact us. I waited more than a week, and nothing came. I am really disappointed and pretty sure I won’t stay at The Standard a 13th time.",Rio de Janeiro,10,2.0

Rooms are comfortable and I had a great view to the South West over the Hudson and lower Manhatten - the bed was very comfortable, but the pillows less so, on the one occasion I did not bring my own pillow from home, I regretted it. The only gripes I have are minor - the strange lack of a bin! The headboard is not permanently attached to the rail above the bed so I knocked it off at 3am and thought what the hell it that on my face... soon sorted and most annoyingly the whistling sound caused by a gap at the bottom of the door into the corridor - soon sorted with floor towel stuffed against it. Shower a big head, hot water very quick to appear and the shower big enough for 2 or more friendly people... and very soft large towels...The bar is cool and has great views, the cafe/grill has a good menu and attentive staff without being irritating, and I really like the floor made up of bonded copper and back painted 1c coins and as my flight was late out of Newark I asked for a late check out 5pm for a fee of course but worth it, the video playing in the life is a bit surreal and disturbing and funny at the same time...Its certainly quieter there than at the Maritime I've also stayed less noise of honking traffic - seriously taxi drivers in NY think that if you pause for a nanosecond after the lights change you should get honked even at 2am.... would I stay again - yes, got a good deal staying via British Airways with a flight and hotel deal","London, United Kingdom",13,3.0

While I have stayed in a lot of NYC hotels this one was the most attentive a good example being they called up to the room to let me know we left a wrapped present in the back seat of our car to make sure we didn't need it. Room was spotless when we showed up ( mirrors in the bathroom always are a good example ) room was dust and scent free. the open bathroom is different but we actually really enjoyed it since the view was one of the most important parts of the stay.

Everything that you may have read about The Standard is probably true. You have to be prepared to be on full display with the floor to ceiling windows, but in return you have a sun-filled room with spectacular views. Our Room was at the end of the Corridor facing the Hudson, so we had perfect exposure to the north, south, and east. The room is VERY open style, but works perfectly for two. It's well worth spending the extra money for a somewhat larger room -- by New York standards, ours was definitely on the larger side. It was great to be high enough so that we did not have an obstructed view, but were still tantalizingly low to be able to look down onto the pedestrians walking the Highline. Yes, that includes from the bathroom. The amenities are all super cozy and the room service had excellent choices. Depending on what view you're looking for, you may want to be quite specific when booking a room. We had a clear view of the World Trade Center, but that came at the expense of being able to look up toward mid-town.

So, I am used to NYC hotels. Some good, some not so good. never awful, till now. This one, I wanted to try. but, I will not return. First, when we arrived, Couldn't find the front door, Circled twice before I saw it. My wife had to go into the hotel to get someone to valet my car. Check in was quick and easy. The room (1420) was small, even for NY standards. Absolutely no where to put our bag. European style bed, Very low, otherwise, ok. I paid for a deluxe queen. I was looking on their website. The room they pictured was not what I was in. Called down and was told the deluxe queen and the standard queen are the same room, The deluxe queen is just a higher floor. Which, being a NYer and staying in many NY hotels, I knew that was better, Less white noise from the city below. I was wrong! (we'll get back to that). Went to the rooftop bar in the late afternoon for drinks, Was nice, great views. very overpriced drinks. Spoke to a nice woman there, told her we would come back after dinner. She said the bar would be closed for a private event. Really? I've never stayed in a hotel that closes it's bar to it's guests. However, she did give us a card and said to email them, Make a reservation and we could come back. So, I did. I got an email back asking what time we were returning, Said 10ish. Got another email back saying. Can you come earlier, we close at 7:30. Again, Seriously? Gave up, went to a bar outside the hotel. Finally got back to our room, on the 14th floor. (up high, quieter, so i thought). we were awoken by this intense pounding. Which, being a former club DJ myself. I knew exactly what it was. And it was loud! Very loud! and the club was 4 floors above us. Couldn't even imagine what it was like in the club. We tried to ignore it. But, no way. Called down and complained. Told, Matt (I think). Either get it turned down or be prepared to comp my room. I swear it got louder after that call. Needless to say, I was pissed! Got up, dressed, went down to the lobby. Spoke to a manager. He must have know who I was. First words out of his mouth was, ""We'll comp your night"". Which they did. After he said that. I told him, you need to turn it down. Which it appeared they did. But, It still kept us up until around 3-3:30AM when it finally stopped. It was an unfortunate situation all around. They do not cater to their guests like other NYC hotels. The staff seemed very nice. Room was clean, tiny, but clean. Weird set up. Toilet is literally in a closet. shower tub and sink all in one room. but, not partitioned. water gets everywhere. Needless to say, i will not be returning. I recommend going to the W. Love those hotels. Oh, and FYI. The Standard website says $65.00 to valet the car. It was $85.00 for one night. But, at that point, I wasn't going to argue. just wanted to leave. Unless you plan on partying till 4 am, I would find another hotel.","Pompton Lakes, New Jersey",18,1.0

Sitting at the nexus of hip LA style and NY glam this intriguing and inspiring destination attracts a mash up of the cool and wanna be cool, all seeking a slice of the high life on the high line.Upon arrival, there is an instant star quality to the lobby with its large yellow revolving doors and endless stream of posing guests and visitors. The guest suites, while not big (this is Manhattan) are intimate with quirky, Mid Century inspired interiors by Roman and Williams, and feature exposed showers and floor to ceiling windows - this is definitely not a stuffy business hotel unless you're in the business of fun, romance or exhibitionism. One can only imagine the stories that these walls could tell!In the King Deluxe Suite, the rich use of wood creates a warm and Scandinavian feeling to the curved and restrained interiors that feature some nicely contrasting black and white details. It is black that pervades most of the wet areas of the bathroom room with the said black tiles making the shower impossibly dark. Given its revealing nature this is no doubt purposeful, so too the complimentary prophylactics. The room is appointed in way that says you're here to stay for a good time and not necessarily a long time, but if you're stay is more than a one nighter (which is a must) you'll be more than pleased to see a healthy array of bar snacks, sweets, drinks, socks, a scented candle, blue-tooth speaker, earphones and a host of bespoke toiletries, along with a book of short stories - all ensuring that you are prepared for whatever the Meat Packing District can throw at you.As far as local attractions, the list really is endless. Of course there's the High Line directly below which takes you all the way to the Hudson Train Yards which makes for a beautiful early morning walk. There's the Chelsea Market, Whitney Museum of Art, boutique fashion stores galore and more food options than you can imagine - from Dos Caminos to Catch, The Red Cat and Scarpetta to name but a few.In the end, The Standard is a kaleidoscope of a venue offering a cheeky, irreverent and fun filled platform to explore and consume Manhattan to the fullest.

There were no rooms with 2 beds so we shared a bed, which is fine, but what was really strange was the glass-encased shower. This shower is in every room in the hotel. Are there that many people that prefer to shower in front of someone else? Does it make it easier to optimize the room layout? OK so besides the shower - here some basic pros and cons.Pros - Great location. Meatpacking is where it's at! And of course - sitting atop the High Line isn't too shabby.Outstanding food & bev on premesis (the bar on the terrace was WONDERFUL as was the staff - so nice!)Staff was extremely helpful and kind.Room was clean and quiet with a great view.Cons - Room was tiny, even for NYC.Elevator service was TERRIBLE. There's a certain time during the day (early evening) where hotel guests must SHARE the elevators with the hipsters trying to get up to the club. At a certain time (later in the evening), hotel staff usher the guests to a working elevator while clubgoers wait for their own, but before that it's absolutely insane.Price - this hotel is SO EXPENSIVE. I expected more. Not sure what - but more.So - though I somewhat enjoyed this alien experience, I wouldn't stay again.","Dayton, Ohio",55,3.0

All aspects of this hotel are anything but the standard when it comes to a typical stay in New York, or elsewhere. First off, the service provided by hotel employees is second to none. From my very first steps in the door, Diede at the front desk was incredibly kind, and helped with all kinds of random questions. After dealing with credit card issues (CC company block due to size of charge), she patiently worked with me to post the charge in smaller increments and wait while I talked with my credit card company. After that fiasco, she still took time to map out the neighborhood and recommend local attractions. After receiving that long list of local places for food and drink (thanks Diede and Kevin C at the front desk), I found it was hardly necessary to ever leave the property. Top of the Standard, Standard Biergarten, Standard Grill and Standard Plaza all provide entirely unique experiences and amazing tastes of the City. But, walking less than a block also opens up a plethora of wide-ranging options. I should mention, the Meat Packing District (and West Village in general) is certainly well-suited for a younger crowd, and may not be the ideal location for couples seeking a slower pocket of NYC. This said, the Standard goes above and beyond in ensuring a romantic and peaceful setting for those seeking out that style of vacation. In fact, despite the lively and youthful atmosphere in that area, the Standard could be a hotel better suited for couples seeking a romantic stay. I was put up in the hotel for work, and as a single young person looking to have some fun in the evenings, I also found that the hotel itself and general area provided endless opportunity. All this said, I would obviously not call this a family-friendly hotel either, but assume most folks looking to stay in the area already know this. The room itself was top-class, in my opinion. The view, the bed, shower, and bathroom in general were complete luxury. I found the only complaint that could be made is in regards to the size of the room, but I personally didn't need any excess space, and again, this is not the hotel for bringing along the kids. Additionally, housekeeping was beyond respectful of my privacy and belongings, and would actually go out of their way to ensure my room was cleaned each day even if I was not out of the room until after scheduled housekeeping hours. The view from my room certainly stands out and cannot be found at just any hotel in New York. It was actually difficult to leave the room at times because of the sweeping views of Lower Manhattan and Jersey City (I had a relatively clear view of the Statue of Liberty from my bed). Other sides of the building can offer even better views, from what I could tell. Overall, I would never leave anything but 5 stars, and will absolutely be back.",,0,5.0

I splurged and decided to get the Hudson suite for me and my significant other. Which came out to around $800. Upon arriving at the hotel approximately 45 minutes after check in which started at 3, we were told that the room wouldn't be ready for another hour and a half. Which put us in a predicament because we had to be at a concert in an hour and would have nowhere to get ready or drop our bags off or even rest after 4 hours of travel. Long story short we ended up getting ready in the only lobby bathroom holding up everyone who was trying to use it. Which made us feel even more embarrassed in a crowd we already didn't feel welcomed in. Our bags were left on the counter who with the very polite person who was assisting us with checking our bags. We only arrived back to the hotel around midnight. Our bags as well as food we ordered through grub hub were delivered up to us in the room which was nice! The room itself was extremely clean, the bed was comfortable, sheets spotless, and mini bar completely stocked with reasonable prices for the items. I also appreciated the open layout of the room with an all glass shower.  As nice as the room was, the views were subpar for rooms that are being advertised as one of the main selling points being the view. Maybe this was just because of the low floor, but we were treated to a view of construction workers and an up close view of the NYC sanitation building which was also covered in construction workers which were directly level with our room. Part of me wanted the room to be upgraded or moved to a higher floor because of the huge inconvenience of not having the room ready when it was expected to be but im not the type of person to complain to already frantic hotel personnel.

I didn't do a complete survey, but I'm pretty sure I was the oldest and least hip person in the hotel.It's located next to Chelsea Market and by the High Line. It's on an odd nook of a street which has the advantage of cutting down on some of the street noise. My room on the fifth floor wasn't exactly silent, but it wasn't noisy, and this is NYC so that's pretty good.Because it's in an odd nook, and because the Standard doesn't believe in signage, I wandered around longer than I should have trying to find it. Look for a door the color of Big Bird. Above it you might notice the upside-down sign.The wifi is free but at 1.5mbps is pretty minimal. You can instead opt to pay $20 (!) to get an unspecified better connection. There are adequate electric outlets in the room.If you're young and hip you well may like this hotel more than I did.

I planned a special getaway, Upon initially making a reservation and the other reservations line I booked a superior king room i mentioned to the reservations associate I specifically wanted a corner room and they were able to guarantee us a corner room. I even after the call and making the reservation i contacted the hotel front desk the day of arrival and they said we did indeed have a corner room. Upon arrival we checked in and once we got to our room, the room was not a corner room as we were promised. I went back down to the front desk and spoke to one of the front desk employees which he said the hotel is sold out and there is nothing he can do nothing about it in a slightly snide tone... He then later passed me onto Samantha Yang which had the pleasure of working with. She was so kind and courteous very understanding of the situation, and again very helpful and given it was New York fashion week I knew the hotel was hectic and instead of brushing us off she was extremely courteous to us and was able to reserve a corner room for us the following night. The following day she was able to move us early (11am) upon getting our new corner room which was AMAZING!!!! She even went as far as sending us a bottle of champagne apologizing for the mixup which we enjoyed drinking while eating the Sunset from our Riverview Corner room. I can't tell you how rare that is nowadays to have employee like that . As someone that travels so much all over the world and stays in countless hotels all over the place having an employee like that is priceless. Given how many hotels there are New York City she has guaranteed all of my, my family's, and companies future business will be given to this hotel.

It starts when you walk through the revolving yellow door into the lobby under the hotel name, which is upside down. As you ascend in the elevator, you face a continuous-loop animated video playing on the elevator walls. It depicts, among other images, the World Trade Center Twin Towers in flames, with people leaping to their deaths, and a hooded Ku Klux Klansman! Very offensive. The small rooms have floor to ceiling windows; ask to face the river and the view of Jersey City and Hoboken! The shower had no curtain at all, so water pooled all over the bathroom floor. Why? Worse, the glass wall one one side of the shower faced the room and the window, so there was no privacy. Why? I noticed at least one creep parked on Little West 13th Street gazing up at people showering! The bed was low but comfortable. The room had a TV, a safe, wi-fi, and a mini-bar. But there was no coffee in the room, no soda machine, no water bottles, no clock.The dog park below and the bars produced both barking and drunken laughter into the night, so bring earplugs. The hotel has a silly and unenforceable rule prohibiting guests from bringing their own booze. We were quoted a wedding base rate of $294 per night; but then they charged us a base rate of $325 for the second night. And they added a $2 'Contribution'! What right do they have to force a donation to their favorite, unnamed charity?! They said they would 'look into all this' , but we've heard nothing. So watch you bill carefully.I would not pick this strange place again.","Chicago, Illinois",260,1.0

Whilst a little noisy it didn't bother us and the room was close to the elevators and right next to the gym. Staff did say if this was not suitable to let them know.

It is obviously one of the very happening places in the meatpacking district so we struggled to get a drink at the beer garden at the door and when we did we had to sit inside. They seemed so busy that the service was not great and was only disappointing thing in terms of this. Housekeeping were fantastic and I really wanted to leave our lady a tip. Needed to know she would get it though. Basics of the hotel. Great shower / towels / bed - very comfy / plenty of sockets / fresh towels everyday and free wi-fi was even ok. Good location close to lots of restaurants and Chelsea Market / Gansevoort Market.

They accommodated my request and I was assigned (I believe an upgraded room) by noon. The room was small but looked exactly like the pictures I saw – queen bed, small bath/shower area, a tiny W.C./toilet and space for clothes. The desk and leather swivel chair were quite comfortable for working and enjoying a quick bite on the adjoining settee. The room had a floor to ceiling window with a view of the river in the distance and a parking lot / Highline below. The city view is also quite nice in the evening.

The location was ok. As long as you're able to walk you'll be just fine. There is a restaurant and several bars within the hotel and/or on the same block. The check-in experience was not ideal - we wanted to carry our own bags up to the room because we were in a bit of a rush for a rehearsal dinner and they insisted that someone bring them up. 30 mins later still no bags. When we phoned down to the lobby, they didn't seem to have a great handle on where exactly our items were. We waited for quite a bit. The elevator situation is horrendous. I think I spent most of my weekend waiting for an elevator. At times they have only two in operation with something like 17 floors. Ended up taking the stairs a lot. The room itself was nice - but if you're not into the modern concept - you will not like this room. There is no privacy for the shower area so if you're staying here with a friend who you don't want to shower in front of you may want to get separate rooms. In our particular room the shower pressure was awful and the water just pooled all over the floor - including in front of the sink. What a mess. We did have a really nice big bathtub and because of the open concept it offered a great view right from the tub - this was really nice. On Saturday we asked for ""Privacy Please"" as we had several valuable items in the room that did not fit into the safe. Upon coming back to the room later that day, the room had been cleaned.

Not only is it unsanitary to leave items from previous visitors, but it seems to have caused a lot of confusion.On top of that wifi was slow, room service food was cold and soaked in grease, but at least the staff was nice.Edit:While the hotel was very helpful with the first accidental charge, they were not as kind with the second. I was charged for a $55 bottle of tequila among other items. When trying to get a refund I was redirected to a phone line that would not pick up. I was able to get slow responses through email. Through those emails, I was told that the staff confirmed the removal of the items and that the housekeeping follows up with what was taken out of the room after the stay. I understand how mini-fridge charges work, but I didn't touch those items. They were condescending and said they would do an adjustment as a one time courtesy.

We did get two rooms right next to each other on the 11th floor. We had ""city view"" rooms and had a very nice view of the Empire State Building - and also a good view of the Hudson River. (There does appear to be new construction just a block or so away in the line of site of the Empire State Building - so hopefully that does not block the view in the future). We did not have any issues with noise as others have described. On various websites, it does list the Standard as having a pool - but we asked at checkin and they said ""no pool for kids"". This was fine as we kept quite busy otherwise. While the hotel itself is not necessarily geared to kids, we found it to be a great central location for a family trip.

Overpriced, trying to be hip, and fails at the basics of a hotel. Basics are: Decent room, comfortable bed, some food options, and reasonable amount of quiet. The only area where The Standard meets the basics is on food options.Let's start with the room. Typical small space of NYC hotels. Bathroom, some sort of bizarre combination of tub an shower where the shower essentially sprays water everywhere. All over the floor and the sink. So you end up walking in a big puddle. Items on the sink get wet. And there isn't much you can do about it. The bed? The bed is euro style meaning it's essentially a box on the floor. That's not bad, I've stayed in plenty of European hotels and love their beds. But they put some cushy mattress on the box which does not work. I woke up with a great deal of back pain as a result.Let's talk noise.... my room overlooked the Hudson and one of the highways. And apparently a garbage barge given the amount of beeping and other noise going on all night. But that was ok because the Disco was vibrating the room until at least 3am so I wasn't going to sleep anyway. When I complained, the front desk laughed and said ""yeah those floors do feel the disco. Just get up and dance!"".

I booked through the hotel website and maybe that was mistake #1. As a patron of the hotel it is up to you to double check everything. You will not be alerted on differences in room rates for your stay. I never received a confirmation of my booking and when I called (mistake #2, I should have emailed so I had a communication trail) to ask for one I was told that yes that had my booking and that they would email me a confirmation. The confirmation was never mailed. The huge difference in the room rates was on the sheet I signed upon checking in and I should have noticed it. However, like most travelers, I was tired and anxious to get to my room; so I wasn't as observant as I should have been. But I can't help but think that it shouldn't be up to me to have to be extra-vigilant about this. Good customer service would make that unnecessary as I would have been alerted about that at the beginning, during the booking process - and then reminded again with the confirmation that I never got.

I felt comfortable and at home. They'd left some water and snacks, too. A couple of things about the room. There was no dresser or drawers of any kind, not even a shelf, nowhere to unpack, so I worked out of my suitcase for the whole stay. Also of note was the tiny toilet stall, about 4x3. Being 6'5""... well... you can imagine. All that said, the room was super quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable. Great towels, too.The elevators have cool video art, but during my rides, they malfunctioned several times. One last thing, the lobby and public areas are extremely busy, especially at night as there is a club on the top floor of the hotel. So there you have it. Not my favorite, but I WOULD stay there again. Not a calm place to be, but exciting and a lot of fun.","Los Angeles, California",14,3.0

They're kind, smart, relentlessly helpful, and incredibly hardworking. They treat you like family, not just a customer or guest. They welcome you with open arms and infectious smiles. You won't find ""attitude"" except the best kind. If there's ever a problem, they'll solve it as quickly as possible; and if things are perfect, well, they'll try to make them even better. I have stayed at this hotel dozens of times, and without fail, Samantha goes above and beyond to make sure everything is great--right up until we walk out the door. She is brimming with positive energy. Monique is always amazing, and one of the coolest, nicest people around. Nina is a superhero at addressing any concerns or questions that might come up. And many other staffers whose names (sorry!) I can't remember at the moment--but truly, everyone you'll encounter, from the guys at the door, to the front desk, to the staff at the gift shop is just wonderful. And, contrary to what you might assume, they love kids! And dogs. So it's the people who keep us coming back, time and again--and of course we love everything else about the Standard, from its stunning design to the superb location: a quick walk to the Whitney Museum, great restaurants and shops, the High Line, Chelsea Market, etc. And it's always lovely to stroll around the West Village, especially in the early morning, or to walk along the Hudson River.

We had a slight issue upon check in - I accidentally booked the wrong room. I called to the front desk and spoke with Sam who instantly began trying to get us into the room I described. After a brief wait, Sam came to personally take us to our room. She was amazing, quick and efficient. On the train on the way back I got an alert from my credit card and noticed a wet bar charge that wasn't ours. I immediately called and was told I needed to call back between certain hours to 'speak with the person who needed to investigate the charge'. I called the next day and was told again to call back at a specific time. I explained that I wanted the hotel to fix my problem and then call me back; that I didn't appreciate having to do all the work to fix their mistake and was still told to call back!Then I remembered I had an email from my shero, Sam. I emailed her and of course the issue was instantly taken care of and my bill credited. I don't know when I'll be back in New York but I'm never booking at The Standard if Sam isn't around.Other hotel notes: We loved our meal at the restaurant; the food and service were amazing. The hotel is in a great location near the very cool highline, the amazing Chelsea Market (where you can get amazing food) and my favorite brunch spot, Cafe Cluney. Also everyone who works at this hotel is really good looking so pack your self confidence!It's a trendy, hip, millennial filled, stereotypical hip NY hotel and it's not for everyone. The elevator was a source of contention as it was locked off to guests during events causing big bottlenecks. Also if you plan to party on the roof make sure it's not closed for an event before booking. We saw some very irate guests over this.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",5,3.0

Begins with check-in and the attendant hustling you to upgrade with a clearly canned act: ""hmm, let me just check on something, ... Oh it looks like the only room we have available [trails off] Wait, were you looking to upgrade?"" ""No? Oh, just a quiet night huh. okay...""Nothing like insinuating you're getting a terrible room and insulting you if you choose not to upgrade to start your stay off on a very low note. I've never seen anything like this at dozens of other NYC hotels, and probably never will (since I won't be staying here again). Having to deal with a shady character trying to scam you for a few extra commission dollars ruins the experience and removes this far from the realm of ""luxury"" hotels. This is a has-been hotel just trying to borrow from the reputation of its associated nightlife. The room furnishing here feels more dated and cheap than nice. Spotty tile floors, poor quality mattress, curtains that let in lots of light instead of blackout sufficient for good sleep, overall it feels more like a bad chain than high-end hotel.

The location is fantastic! Walking distance to numerous great restaurants in a vibrant and authentic feeling neighborhood free of tourist traps.The room was very nice; immaculately clean (and housekeeping did an excellent job every day), comfortable bed and stunning view including the Empire State Building from the floor-to-ceiling-wall-to-wall windows that made up one wall. The bed was very comfortable, the mattress was the perfect mix between firm and soft, the pillows were soft down and the sheets were high quality. Unfortunately I didn't realize I could've bought both a sheet set and their signature comforter until I returned home - to make up my own bed The Standard High Line style.The one negative about the room for me was the lack of wardrobe/storage space. I stayed for five nights and when I'm away for that long I prefer to unpack and not live out of my suitcase. There was a small wardrobe with a shelf and a bar with a few hangers right inside the door and that was it. The only good spot for my suitcase was standing upright in the wardrobe, unless I wanted to put it somewhere in the middle of the floor where I'd risk tripping over it.I traveled with a family group and we had a dinner and several breakfasts at The Standard Grill.

The service was adequate, at best, and the elevator situation and complete lack of access to the roof top bar due to private events all 3 nights we were there was ridiculous. Here are the details of my experience:I booked a corner view room at $735/night - I had stayed in 1411, a corner room on a prior stay, fantastic views from the higher rooms on that side of the hotel - For this stay, I was assigned room 510, yes, it was a corner room, but it was on a lower floor on the city side, so the floor to ceiling windows were useless with ""views"" of buildings and ventilation equipment on the top of nearby buildings - no views at all - and the rate was the same as my last stay - $735/night - and 510 was much smaller as well. I called the front desk explaining the difference in what I expected for $735 and what I got - they moved me to 1411, the same room I had the prior stay, but there was a 5-10 min delay for the elevator because they had 2 elevators exclusively for the private party at the roof top bar and only 2 elevators for all the hotel guests - ALL the service personnel/service carts/room service carts were also sharing the limited elevator capacity with the hotel guests, and given the size of the service carts, few guests fit in the elevator after the service equipment is loaded. I didn't realize that first night that the grossly inadequate elevator situation would be a huge inconvenience all 3 nights due to the private parties at the roof top bar, which also set up a situation where we were not able to go up to the roof top bar our entire stay - there were lines in the elevator area every night to get back up to the room, and there were also guests of the private parties trying to get on the hotel elevators thinking they could get up to the 18th floor private party without waiting in the long line for that which was outside - I mentioned my dissatisfaction with nonhotel guests making the already long elevator lines even longer, and I asked why the heck don't they put a security person to screen to make sure only hotel guests can get on the 2 remaining hotel elevators - no one seemed to care - at all...except the other hotel guests who were complaining. In addition, one of the two hotel guest elevators only allowed 3 floor buttons to be pushed at one time, so any time there were guests staying on more than 3 different floors, all the buttons reset and had to be pushed again, but only 3 at a time, so when someone got off on a lower floor, the next person up could then push their floor number. The gym is adequate, but there is no water available, other than a drinking fountain out the door - I find that most often, at a hotel where I'm paying $735/night for a room, there are water bottles in the gym and often fruit as well - minor for the hotel to provide, but so many other hotels provide that service - and that is because guests using the gym appreciate a bottle of water to use on the cardio equipment so they don't have to get off, and walk out the door to get a sip of water - or at a minimum they have chilled water available, in the gym, for guests to refill personal bottles.I was not alone in grumbling about the elevator lines, lack of access to the roof top bar and the resetting elevator buttons, all of which took away from the experience. The manager did credit 50% of one of my nights stays, a nice gesture, so my stay was $1850 rather than $2200 - but I'd rather have spent that $1850 on a 3 night hotel stay at one of the other fabulous NYC hotels - this stay was a real disappointment.","Tiburon, California",1,2.0

For the price of about $600 a night, we expected a decent place. Nothing fancy. Just decent. At least with good relaxed comfortable atmosphere , not pretentious, bland, devoid of authenticity and with nothing to show for. Which is pretty much what The Standard High Line is all about. Room was too small even for NYC. The corner seating is nice if there was space. But I'd prefer to have a bigger bed than something that is more like a full bed than a queen-sized bed. And please, what happened to the side tables? Where can I charge? The room only had 1 free socket to use which is at the opposite side of the foot of the bed. The music thumping from the night club reaches all the way to the lower floors. No complimentary water, snacks or even coffee served in the rooms. We have to go fetch our own coffee in the lobby????Limited personal care items. Room is devoid of character. It felt like a sterile hospital room with a view.

The hotel definitely targets the younger hipster crowd that frequents the Meatpacking District with lots of loud partying from the top floor club that spills over into the public areas at weekends. If you fit this demographic you will love it. If not, you will need to hide out in your room on one of the lower floors. Some quirky features like pitch black elevators, a window from the bedroom area into the bathroom and mattresses that are a few inches from the floor. Bed was far too soft for me, but I realize this is a personal preference. Good restaurant but wine servings by the glass were the smallest I have seen and when I ordered a second glass the waiter just topped up my partially empty glass to its former level rather than giving me a full second glass. A picky point, but it shouldn't happen.","Walnut Creek, California",15,4.0

He helped me do a quick booking online through the app. I ran through some few problems because the app only accepts credit.

Some people have said that the higher rooms are not as quiet as the lower floors because of the club on the roof. I'd have to say that we didn't notice any more noise than usual for a hotel and that was even with a well attended, private party going on up there. The minibar was well stocked and not really outrageously priced on most things. The room was clean and well kept. If you are traveling with family or friends and are on the shy side though, this room place may not be for you. The shower was all glass on two sides and no door. We loved it but things could get kind of awkward if you and your buds are there for a night LOL. In all reality, this place is for couples and partying and it hits it out of the park in those two categories. Front desk staff and the valet attendants were friendly and helpful.

If you want comfort and luxury, it falls short. I stayed in the Empire Suite, which I believe is one of their larger, if not largest rooms. The views is very nice, but the room is not very functional.The bed, is partly on a platform, so you have to walk up to get in on one side, giving you sort of a trapped in feel. It's not the kind of bed conducive to certain activities if you understand what I mean, but it looks ""cool"", along with the bathtub right next to the bed with no privacy - I can deal with that, as again they are trying to be edgy and cool and let you show of your nakedness to the world. What I can't deal with, is the very low lighting. The main bathroom is quite small (by standards of NYC suites) and not well light. The shower also has a see through wall, so again you can show off your body to your BF/GF/spouse/mistress/whomever, though it's a bit smoky the glass. The second bathroom is all but useless. The lighting is low you can barely see yourself in the mirror, and you are basically showering in the dark with just a soft glow...it's by the design. There are a bunch of closely packed leather couches at the foot of the bed, and the walkways are a bit narrow. The room does have one of the best bars I've ever seen in a hotel room. It's clear this room is just designed for drinking, partying, whatever, and cool factor, but comfort factor suffers.The location is great if you want to be around the Meat Packing District, but otherwise, not much else is around there. SoHo is a bit too far of a walk (IMO), and 5th Ave., Broadway, Central Park, etc. you'll need to get a lift. There's a popular roof top bar, but seems it is not clear when or how you can get in (it was private, then it wasn't, then it was, I can't keep track...but just make sure you know the admission policies if you are anticipating going there). Finally, restaurants connected with the hotel are not bad, but are overrated. You're not going here for the food.Overall, good hotel if you're coming to NYC to drink, have fun, hook up...but if you in NYC more for luxury, fine dining, shopping, Broadway, you might want to consider other hotels in more appropriate locations.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",116,3.0

I recently downloaded the 'One Night Standard' app and it's amazing. Friday night, my girlfriend and I were crushing it at karaoke in the village and didn't want to the party to end and did NOT want to go home to our significant others, so we booked a room through the app. We checked in at 230am and were greeted by Christopher, a surprisingly chipper guy working the front desk. He was super friendly and was able to get us into a bigger room than originally expected. We sat around in fancy robes, talked all night and had gourmet room service delivered at 4am.

Everything about it was spectacular, so it made my boyfriend's birthday weekend go perfectly. But beware, I booked the room through a third party and had some booking issues. Thankfully, The Standard's customer service was so helpful! I booked the Superior King room, and it was so spacious. There was a plumbing issue and someone was able to quickly fix it for us! The only thing I did not like was the layout of the stand up shower and the toilet. It was opened with no door available, not really ideal during the winter time. You really needed to stay underneath the hot water to avoid getting cold. As for the toilet, it was in this separated room. I felt a bit claustrophobic. Despite that, our room was very nice. We had a spectacular view of the high line and the hudson river! Overnight, the noise level was moderate. Which was understandable because of the rooftop nightclub. The Standard altered how to get to the elevator towards the evening, and I assume this was to avoid clubgoers and hotel guests from bumping into one another. Awesome idea. The location around The Standard could have not been better. You have the high line in walking distance, the village is very nice to explore and has plenty of bars opened to keep you entertained. During the winter, The Standard have an ice skating rink for free access for hotel guests! Only need to pay for the skate rental (only $4) but I ended up staying during a nice, warm weekend and all the ice melted. The beer garden and grill are also cool places to try during your stay. I can't wait to come back and book the Studio room.","New York City, New York",12,4.0

The room's design is beautiful in itself - spacious for New York, and with a stunning tub. The room service food is not great - but I don't think many tourists eat in in New York! And I was absolutely obsessed with the Marco Brambilla installation-like video in the lifts! They're truly stunning.However, I do have to complain about the staff. We felt from the beginning that they seemed much more focused on daytrippers and to people visiting the hotel's bar as opposed to their guests. Fleeting, walk in commerce clearly trumps hotel guests who were paying to be there over numerous days and nights. This is a mistake for a hotel that aims to be a destination setting for international travellers. The reception staff weren't welcoming on arrival, which set alarm bells going . . . They were not forthcoming with information about the hotel itself or its amenities at check in - which we found odd - and they offered no insight into nearby dining/shopping/museum destinations when we asked. In fact, they were rude and abrasive any time we engaged with them - which I have to say is most surprising for NYC! Any time I asked them questions over the days we stayed there they appeared summarily bored, and treated myself and my partner as if we shouldn't be bothering them . . . I felt especially bad as my partner had booked the destination as a romantic surprise, and had gone to such effort to book a killer room for us over a busy time of the year.All in all, a beautifully designed hotel - but with terrible staff.","Greater London, United Kingdom",2,4.0

Overall, I stayed there for about 60 days over the next 3 months.River-view queen room on 11th floor was my favourite. Spectacular view of the financial district, Hudson river and New Jersey, comfortable tub, and room resembling of a little Studio all contributed to the experience. I also stayed in river-view King room at 13th floor (which was having an even better view, but the bed was definitely too soft), city-view king room at the same floor (pretty dark, too little light getting there through the small window, a bit depressing in the long run) and corner-king (with a panoramic view, although I'd still prefer the river through my window).There are a few misunderstandings, like the ""pool"" is, forgive my choice of words, a pretty small... pond in the club upstairs. When BoomBoom Room (club) is open, the elevators work horribly slow (could easily take up to 5 minutes just to get one). The ""open bathroom"" concept is cool (for couples, not really for broader family), but proves very impractical (taking a shower leaves the whole bathroom floor wet). Beds, especially King ones, can be soft to the point of extreme back pains (and this was for active, working out young people). However, the overall experience was still very good and I would be happy to go back there in the future.In summary: the view was inspiring, the tub and shower - useful to relax after a long day, housekeeping service was excellent, and Kevin C. at the front desk was always kind and ready to help.","London, United Kingdom",2,4.0

We both know that design hotels are not so friendly sometimes for a family style, but the experience with The Standard was quite disappointing. Hotel staff was definitely not oriented to families (treatment, support, attention, etc). From the reception until the bars and restaurants.The crib offered by the hotel is incredible small. The room cleaning was not good enough for a kind of this hotel class. Nothing special in the decoration or furniture. At the same floor we face a lot of problems with noise, smokers and drug users (other guests). The staff was notified several times, but don´t reacts appropriately to solve the problem. And don´t have any sensibility to demonstrate attention or support to family facing a situation like that in their hotel. To expensive and not fancy enough to have a experience like that.

When it arrived it was Swiss cheese (obviously) and not to his taste. He asked for cheddar. Duly requested, and despite having none, the hotel managed to find some. This in a city where shops close at 6pm and 24 hr service just doesn't exist.Why is this relevant to a review of the Standard? Well, the Swiss proudly believe to have the best hoteliers in the world. However, New Yorkers believe they have the vest hotels in the world - evidenced by the fact you have to pay over $400 to stay in anything less than a hovel. And whilst the Swiss can rightly claim their boat. New Yorkers are so far off the mark. In my time in NYC I've stayed in many hotels. From being with the pimps and drug dealers at HoJo's on 8th to the Waldorf. None have been any good. The standard is no exception to this. From arrival this is a lazy hotel. Young staff may make it feel edgy, but what they have in looks they clearly lack in experience. Check in (an out) is a comedy affair. In my case not helped that they managed to lose my bag that I had I left with them for a weekend - it took over 30 minutes to locate during which time communication was terrible.When you do get to the rooms they are tiny and pimped to look like the 1970's. Low on comfort and low on quality. Already looking tired and less than 10 years old, you get little for your money here. You might have guessed I'm not a fan of NYC. This hotel exemplifies all the reasons why I struggle with this city. It is brash, arrogant and dismissive. It lacks any real charm and instead offers a pastiche of what you can expect in the neighbouring bars. The only upside is the excellent grill which is very good. Don't stay but do eat here. That is the only reason this gets 2 stars. ","London, United Kingdom",109,2.0

There is not a bad room in the house- floor to ceiling windows and stunning city views. The rooftop bar, the Boom Boom Room is one of the prettiest bars I have ever seen (note, they have a dress code and ripped denim is not permitted!- dress your best, and you will want to when you see what everyone else is wearing, including the hostesses). Room service options are fantastic and the breakfast is one of my favorites (Simple scrambled farm fresh eggs, w/ Gruyere and country bread). In the winter season the ice skating rink is a holiday favorite and in the warmer months the hotel sits ON TOP OF the Highline which is a NYC favorite for locals and tourists- I lived in Manhattan for 8 years and still love everything about the highline. You can walk right next door to the Whitney Museum, and always visit the outdoor rooftop bar with insane views right on site of the hotel. The hotel has a super hip vibe that makes you feel swanky every time you even get in the elevator. I Highly recommend this property, and thank you again to the team that makes it that way! Note: If you are a last minute traveler, download their one night stand app for amazing last minute deals! You might even get a room with city views and HUGE tub! Also worth signing up for their email- they have great discounts throughout the year.","New York City, New York",1,5.0

I was suppose to receive a package directly at the hotel and I sent a special message to inform the hotel about il. They answered that they received it and would gladly keep it for me. However, they sent it back pretexting that my name wasn't on there reservation list because there was a mess in their reservations. I am sure that if I didn't show up they would of found my name and credit card to charge it ! One of us had a 30$ bar tab included in his room so we showed up at the bar but no way we could enter. Begining at 4PM the roof top bar is packed with people and it would be a fight to get in. If you have a room in the hotel, don't plan to get back in around 4PM or you'll be waiting like everyone else (hundreds of poeple are going to the bar) and it could be difficult to get into an elevator.

I've had the chance to interact with most of the lovely people working at the front desk and they have always been great in answering my questions and really making me feel at home. Andrea, Kevin, and Colleen (to name a few) at the front office have been so friendly and welcoming. I was once waiting in the lobby for a few hours after check-out before heading to the airport as my flight had been severely delayed and Kevin was so kind and easy to talk to that he made the whole situation so much more comfortable. I was also very grateful when he followed up to see if I'd received a package that reception was kind enough to arrange to send out via FedEx for me. It's so nice to feel that you're being looked after even once you've checked out. The hotel is also great because of the restaurant and the bar options available. It's nice to know that you don't have to go far for great food and drinks in a fun atmosphere. Room service is also very speedy and with a lot of late night options, which is very rare. I've stayed in different types of rooms and with different views and they've all been wonderful. The rooms are very clean and spacious and the views are all truly breath-taking from every floor.

The location is very good, situated within the Meatpacking District close to Chelsea Market and Hudson River. The Hotel rises on 17 floors with a well known roof top bar on the 18th floor. The rooms are rather small for the price paid and the decoration is willingly old style which didn't impress me much. I can mention though that the bath tub is big, the bed very comfortable and if you are on the right side of the hotel you can have an impressive view on the financial district with it's skyscrapers and One World Tower.The facilities of the hotel are overall nice, with a German Biergarten and two other restaurants that serve from breakfast to dinner. I was surprised however that breakfast only starts at 7am which I find very late for a business hotel. If you have the chance go up to the top floor bar that has impressive views 360°. Unfortunately during our stay the bar was closed for 4 consecutive nights due to private events which also led to the shutdown of 2 out of the 4 elevators, which was a real nuisance.Depending on who is in charge staff can go from very friendly to plainly bored and apathic. As an example on my last day I asked for an extension of the checkout from noon to 1 as I then left to the airport. After literally yawning at me the receptionist told me the best she could do is to extend to 12.30 which obviously was of no help at all.As mentioned in the title the Hotel can be very noisy. As I was staying on the 15th floor I had all the music noise from the top floor bar as well as surrounding noises coming from the hallway and the neighbouring rooms. Fortunately I was so jetlagged that I still could sleep but be aware that the place is noisy.Overall I found my experience average and I wouldn't go back if I had the choice as the price was quite steep for what we got.","Mexico City, Mexico",16,3.0

The Biergarten is the perfect afterwork hangout for casual drinks and of course lets not forget the two crown jewels Le Bain and Boom Boom which have dominated NYC nightlight since the hotel opened in 2009. All and all it can be relaxing, luxurious, wild or any combination of the three. It's a fantastic hotel and I would hightly recommend.

The service was incredible and it ended up being one of the best weekends I've had in ages. Monique in concierge was wonderfully helpful in setting us up with our room. When asked for recommendations for good wine she helped us select the perfect Malbec and when our bathtub broke (oops!) mid-stay she had it fixed in the flick of a wrist.

Wanted to try something different - and The Standard certainly is different. Other reviews are remarkably accurate about how the hotel caters to the younger/hip/scene. This hotel feels like the 'authentic' version of a trendy hotel, vs. the W which is the more corporate counterpart. That having been said, our overall experience was just ""meh"" for a number of reasons. Rooms are small. We live in NY - this was not a surprise. But the whole ""bed on the floor"" was a surprise - and would not be welcome if you have trouble 'getting up."" Views were great. As others have commented, be sure to draw your shades if you want privacy - otherwise, you are on display for the High Line. Overall furnishings were fine. As some have commented - rooms are nearly ""all white"" - unfortunately, the housekeeping/attention to detail missed a significant stain on our comforter/duvet, which detracted from our experience. Room noise was significant - we were on a low floor (5) and you could hear hallway noise far too easily in the room. Big miss was lack of in-room coffee. I have seen remarks on other TA comments from hotel management informing people how 'there are many coffee bars nearby.' That's a weak response from management. Aspiring four star+ hotels should have in-room coffee. Full stop. I had to wake up early to jaunt outside to get my wife her morning cup of java - which I did not mind, but which was inconvenient. Also must comment on the dark elevators - would be great if you were drunk or on mind-altering drugs, but otherwise are just stupid - you can't see the buttons and more than a few people have shared my view ""what are they trying to hide with dark elevators""? (e.g. lack of attention to detail/housekeeping). Hotel vibe is definitely ""we are the cool kids"" - which is fine if you need/want that. We wanted a nice clean, high quality room with some style/panache. Happy we tried The Standard - but unlikely to return.",New York,47,3.0

There is so much I hate and love about this hotel. The skating rink out front and the heated outdoor Biergarten and rooftop lounge are wonderful. The rooms are warmly/modernly decorated but totally unworkable for anyone over 70 pounds or 3 feet tall. Bed is on the floor (no legs) so getting in and out is very difficult (esp for older folk who have to get up a lot during the night). The small couch is only a foot from the ground. The single chair could not hold my 13 year old grandson. The shower/wash room has no door on it so no privacy. The bathroom is so teenie I hit my knees on the wall when I use it. This is a 'hip' neighborhood, which means there are noisy drunk people out at all hours of the night. Unless you are one of those folk, get a room at a high level. While there are some decently sized rooms, most are so small that two adults can't be up and around without knocking into each other. And it's expensive.","Delmar, New York",0,3.0

Mostly older couples but quite a few older singles traveling together.We were hoping for a hotel long on service and even longer on ambiance. I'm afraid we were sadly disappointed. The hotel staff was less than helpful, and seemed more interested in catering to their ""Hip"" night club crowd. During the day it was pretty much a very normal hotel with few amenities. But at night it turns into a very busy meat market. The lights in the halls and by the elevators are turned way down and one of the two elevators are commandeered for the night club on the roof. Leaving long waits in the dimly lit area for hotel guests. The biggest surprise was in the rooms. The bathtub is raised to the height of the bed, and is completely glassed in. Therefore you shower in front of whomever happens to be in the room. This was not appreciated by most of the members of our art group as their were just roommates. The hotel actually advertises the fact that it's looking for people to hook up.This is from their website. When to One Night Stand Oh, the one-night stand, that erotic carpe diem. It capitalizes the here, the now, and the maybe-once-tomorrow-morning. But like all of life’s adventures, there are no guarantees how it will turn out. Fatal Attraction-type scenarios notwithstanding, what are some of the elements that help you pull the trigger. Is it really worth it? Will someone better come along? What kind of shame spiral coefficient are we looking at? When they’re ready to go, and you’re not quite convinced, let this one-night stand decision tree ferry you to the banks of non-committed satisfactionThen there is a tree showing different scenarios and outcomes. What bothered me about this hotel was that it was not appropriate for all travelers and you have no idea what your walking into. It definitely is not suitable for many travelers. I'm sure the hotel would be great for the intended audience. ","Des Moines, Iowa",6,2.0

Its vibrant, and in a fabulous location in the meat packing district- it was way above my expectations as Ive stayed at the standard in LA and didn't rate it that much. Its a great place if you're in NYC on your own as it has a buzz and feels energetic, there is a good bar and restaurant attached too.But it would also work for couples wanting a NYC weekend break. The clientele are mostly in their late twenties and thirties but if you are older that shouldn't put you off as long as you aren't looking for persian carpets and chandeliers type of place. Its modern architecture and good service, not perhaps up to say the standard of The Greenwich or the newly opened Beekman but its cheaper and really good value for what you get and if you get the right room the view is breathtaking. I hesitated to give it four stars as almost gave it five and for the right client this would be a five star hotel but I loved staying here. The fact that I had to call room service a few times a day before getting served meant I gave it four stars, but id definitely recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in New York.","London, United Kingdom",80,4.0

Not quite the service we had experienced in The Sheraton, Stamford CT where we had just come from. An everyday Sheraton but with good customer service.We sorted out a table ourselves, and it was good, but we were left with a bad aftertaste due to this customer (lack of) service.The doormen of the club have a worse attitude.When we complained to the reception, the manager was polite in her telling us there was nothing she could do; ""these facilities are nothing to do with the hotel"". Then I would say, the website is misleading and if you are considering staying be advised of this small print detail.The concierge, in offering us alternatives, also had an attitude.This establishment does not offer anything like the customer service you can get in other hotels in New York.In summary: It is cool, but they know it.

Kevin, the night shift attendant, made me stay 30 minutes apart from my husband in the roof top bar because he was just so arrogant and reluctant to help us understanding what was the problem with the elevators. Last but not least: we paid $200 for a late check out and our key didn't work all the 4 times we try to use it. It could be a simple thing to a hotel to solve but they always met us with arrogance.

There are far more attractive and significantly less expensive options (like The Dream) nearby. Air B&B would also have a range of better options. I stayed with my wife for a week at The Standard in mid October 2016. We didn't have the option to move to another hotel as the booking was prepaid and non-refundable. As guests we found the staff and service in general to be at best, indifferent. On other occasions we found them rude and hostile. Overall they do not appear happy in their work are not what we've come to know of hospitality professionals. They really don't care. It occurred to us that this is a culture fostered by hotel management who, apparently, are far more concerned with the patrons in the nightspots, bars and restaurants rather than the hotel guests. As paying guests we weren't permitted access to hotel bars due to private functions more than once. The room we had was form over function. It was small and badly designed, particularly for storing clothing and luggage. On the positive side, the view from our room was fantastic and the hotel did refund one night's charge as we were delayed in arriving by hurricane Matthew.","Sydney, Australia",28,1.0

We decided to stay here because we were in town for Halloween weekend to attend ""Not Your Standard Bingo"" which takes place at the Standard Bar and Grille just downstairs. This hotel's location and proximity to shopping and excellent restaurants is perfect. Drinks at the Standard Bar and Grille were a favorite this weekend for its fun atmosphere and easy proximity. We didn't eat there but it looked good. I can't recommend trying to get into Bingo enough - this was by far the highlight of the weekend. Its like a big NYE party with bingo. SO FUN! Now for the room review - I got a deluxe king river view and my girlfriend got the larger corner room version for herself and her daughter. The extra space in the larger room is wasted space and the layout is odd. Not worth the extra money. They actually liked my room much better. Beds are very low, they are on the floor platform style beds. They were all white and clean. Housekeeping did a great job. The mini bar guy going up and down the halls yelling mini bar drove me to drink! My friends room had a weird shower room that had the sink in the shower so if you are not alone you will be showering in an open space while someone else is doing their makeup and trying not to get wet. That was not the case in my room. My shower was separate. Just another reason to book the deluxe king and not the corner room. The river view was beautiful. I was on the 13th floor and street noise was not terrible but it is NYC so you have to expect some noise.","Carbondale, Colorado",29,4.0

The room furnishings seemed minimal to focus on its amazing surroundings.Seriously one or the most memorable hotel experiences EVER. Love this hotel so much.","Winnipeg, Canada",48,5.0

We arrived at 9pm and checked in. The guy on reception then ran through the various bars and restaurants available at break neck speed as a queue was forming. When I asked about using the roof top bar I was told after 945pm entrance was at the door mans discretion. We used the bar one night and it was a great view, great vibe and entry was no problem at all, however I would expect, as a guest paying $400 per night that this would be automatic entry and not up to a doorman! We upgraded our room to a senior king and cannot complain about the size of the room or bed which was super comfy. But again I did expect complimentary bottled water and tea/coffee making facilities. I get your in NYC and everyone orders takeout everything, but sometimes it's just a nice home comfort to have a cuppa in your bed. The room service charge was only $2 for a coffee but then they add another $9 on for bringing it up to your room. There was no wardrobe to speak off, merely a small rail and 3 shelves fitted into a wall indentation and then covered with a curtain! No other drawers or storage space so my lived out of his case for 5 days. The room was very clean but I was cold and wax told by reception that the heating hadn't been switched on so just gave me an extra blanket. The bathroom wall was a panel of glass so although it didn't bother us, as we've been married for 18 years, those with a little more modesty maybe feel slightly awkward taking a shower whilst they look directly into the bedroom! The loo, thankfully is behind a door. Although it's so small you felt like your sitting in a cupboard! We were never greeted with any kind of recognition from reception during our stay and felt the staff were just too cool for school with a big helping of unfriendly arrogance layered on top. Would I stay there again. No. would I recommend it? yes the bar and beirgarten but not the accommodation. The location is fabulous and there's so many great bars, restaurants and shops all walkable.

Our expectations were set high upon walking in, but our dealing with the staff of The Standard blew our expectations out of the water. We were helped at the front desk by Regina and I can honestly say that she is a huge reason our visit was exceptional. She was immediately super kind and nice to us and showed a genuine interest in us having a good time. Regina took her time in finding is the perfect room, asking what we'd like and making her search for our room tailor made. Regina sat behind the desk for a solid five minutes before looking up at us and telling us that she's going to make our stay ""Unforgettable"". She was not lying.Our room was on the 25th floor, with a 180 degree view overlooking the Hudson. A view from which you could see the WTC from one window , and the Empire State Building from the other window on the far side.

We decided to split our trip up and stay in different areas of the city, but this was definitely the highlight for us and our second stop in NYC. We arrived on a Friday night, check-in was easy and our room was a far more comfortable size than our previous hotel uptown. Success!We wanted to head out and explore the area, so I jumped in the shower. The bath was enormous, easily big enough for two, but I was in a hurry and needed a quick shower. I was really surprised because the pressure was at the lower end of scale and wasn't coming out from a portion of the shower head, especially compared to our previous but more basic hotel shower. My partner took a look at it and also thought thay something must be wrong with it, and called the front desk to ask them to check it. The response was somewhat nonchalant (that's just how it is), however an engineer would check it in 30 mins. We went off on our merry way and figured that the engineer would see the problem and hopefully fix it.Upon our return, my partner and I asked about it at the front desk but were basically fobbed off again. We were bitterly disappointed. Long story short, a manager at the hotel found out that we were pretty miffed about the response we received and contacted us first thing Sunday morning. She arranged for us to be moved so that the shower could be fixed and was incredibly apologetic. The hotel went above and beyond to let us know that we were indeed valued and that they wanted us to enjoy our stay. And that we did.Although the start was a bit frustrating at the time, The Standard more than redeemed themselves. We had an amazing stay and it's definitely an experience that I will remember fondly for the rest of my life. The views are spectacular, however if you book one of the more basic rooms (which still have great views), you can still enjoy the full 360 degree views from the bar, nightclub, or rooftop. If you can afford a room with a better view, do it. It's worth the money but you won't want to leave the room to do anything else. It's comfortable enough that you don't have to!The room service food is also fantastic, but there is a plethora of restaurants and other options nearby including the Chelsea Markets. It's obviously right on the Highline but you are also right across from a great running/walking/cycling path along the Hudson that leads down to Battery Park. It's also not too far from the Subway, making it easy to travel uptown if you want to. Staying in the Meatpacking District is a much more pleasant and authentic NY experience than if you stay further uptown, and I would also recommend The Standard for this reason.Overall we had a fantastic stay, oh and as a balletomane I also loved the Prokofiev in the lift!",Australia,8,5.0

When I return, I would choose something closer to upper Manhattan. Check in easy. Everything about it seamed small. It has a gorgeous view overlooking Hudson Bay. You can see both NJ & NY - truly awesome (being from Dallas). Was very surprised at the size of the Statue of Liberty so tiny among all the skyscrapers. Not too many breakfast places within walking distance that opened before 10 AM. We found an adorable one with 'normal' breakfast items just down the street. The room was cute and mattress was on the floor (I think). This was supposed to make the room look bigger? The shower was open - no door and the bathroom completely separate with it's own space. It was a very nice small room with an exceptional view. A little pricey but hey, it's the meat packing district. Below was the City Line boardwalk that was awesome. The hotel restaurant had a good menu and the outside seating was great for people watching. The staff was nice, but not overly nice. Just maybe that's the way New Yorker's are. lol.",Plano,38,4.0

Tables and chairs could have come from the 70s but were clearly very modern. I upgraded to a higher room so I would get the best views possible and the Floor to ceiling Windows looking out over the Empire State certainly did not disappoint. The shower has a glass wall next to the bed so make sure you are sharing with someone you know intimately as there really is no room for privacy in this respect (the toilet is behind a closed door). The minibar and larder was very well stocked with nibbles and drinks to cover pretty much anything you might need - beyond that room service was on hand at a moments notice.The staff were really friendly and efficient. room service was delivered promptly and the food was to a very high standard.The room was spotless with plenty of clean fluffy bath towels (4) and the bed was really comfortable.The in room technology is intuitive and I had no problems instantly pairing my iPhone to play music while I showered and changed to go out.The rooftop bar is superb for views and I made sure I had time to sit drinking a few vodka martinis as the sun went down. I dressed up a bit to go up there as previous reviews mention that that there is a dress code. You don't need to go over the top as some people were fairly casually dressed - just use your common sense.I loved the area around the hotel which felt very safe, bustling with a youngish crowd in the wide range of cafes, bars and restaurants.The High Line is also on the doorstep (as the hotel name suggests) and is definitely worth a look. The converted railway line now feels like an urban garden with great views suddenly appearing of the city as you make your way around it. It was a hot sunny day and so ice creams helped make the experience all the more enjoyable.I will 100% stay here again - Very much recommended.","Leeds, United Kingdom",10,5.0

I'd walked past the hotel on previous trips to New York and really wanted to treat myself for a special birthday. I was lucky enough that my parents and friends were able to join me. Firstly the good things. Our room was on the 17th floor with stunning views of the Empire State building. The bed was massive (although we had a superior King room) and an interesting shower and bath on full view of your room buddy and most of people in the buildings opposite if you make the mistake of assuming the rooms have tinted floor to ceiling glass... be warned, they don't! The rest of the hotel though was a total disappointment. The service from staff was lacklustre at best and just damn rude at worst. If you dare to complain they just smile at you and don't even apologise. Basically if your face doesn't fit your not welcome and they have no problem in telling you. The lifts after 9pm even stop going to the top floor so you can't possibly enter the roof bar. Not that the staff told us this until they escorted us down from the terrace like we were criminals, because we dared to walk up one flight of stairs to get to the bar!! We simply assumed the lift was broken. When we did finally get to the terrace at 5pm the following evening we were met with equally unfriendly staff who spoke to my Dad in a really patronising Manor saying ""just so you know, you are not allowed to move the chairs"" because he was kind enough to pull up a chair for my friend. You can see from my photo how empty the place was! Well, just so you know your hotel is pretentious and you have zero idea of how to offer any service to your customers. Basically, save your money. Stay at the W in union square instead and walk the 20 mins to get to the meatpacking district. ","Rochester, United Kingdom",43,1.0

I wish we'd have stayed in the Air BNB as the service from the owners was awesome despite them not even being there IE: completely the opposite of the hotel. I have never stayed somewhere so pretentious as The Standard Hotel. It has an air of 'we're The Standard, if you don't stay here we'll fill your room easily so aren't bothered about our service'. The rooms are small and weird. If you're staying with friends and are openly happy with showering naked in view of the entire bedroom then this is the hotel for you. Thankful the toilet/WC had its own door. We did have to move rooms on the first night though as the tiles had been laid away from the plughole and were draining shower water towards the door instead (not an easy fix and people 'have complained of that before’) Have no fear though, you can always make things better by having a drink to take the edge off...if you can get served that is. We even found paying our bill difficult and could have easily walked off without begging to part with our money. The service was so bad at the outside bar that we complained to the hotel reception. After telling the whole story I was asked to tell it again… to ‘her manager’ (yawn) who gave us 1 free bar token for the Beer Garden (you can't pay cash) to entice us back in there. As guests are allowed to go to the roof top bar until 9pm (rock and roll, before they switch off the lift access to their super pretentious trendy club for the evening) we thought we'd give it a go but be warned if you have a large group you're not allowed to move the chairs and sit together. Who wants to sit together anyway hey? I'd love to comment on the room service but I was not prepared to pay the $7 room service fee for delivery and we didn't eat at the hotel to assess the quality food. All in all, not impressed. They need to focus more on customer service, realising that everyone's money is a good as the next persons regardless of whether your face fits with their required profile.

I've come to the Highline because it caters to all of my needs: the linens are super soft, I can bring my dog, the views are fabulous (especially through those floor-to-ceiling windows), and above all the large soaking tubs come standard in every room category. The front desk staff in the time I've been staying here has been pretty consistent; I've seen the same people in the course of the last 9 months or so, which to me says something positive. Last time I stayed Colleen checked me in and she was so warm and friendly; she even helped get us an upgrade. The ambiance of the hotel is trendy, and they have a lot of venues for different types of experiences. The location is great; the Meatpacking has great clubs and dining, but if you prefer the more quiet route take a stroll on the Highline in the morning into Chelsea and tuck into the galleries up there.","New York City, New York",5,5.0

I guess this is what you'd call a ""boutique hotel"" as it sort of reminded me of the W Hotel in Austin, TX. Checking in, the service was great -- fast, friendly, and informative.The room was was very nice and modern and ""hip."" The layout was sort of weird to me as the bed was pretty much lying on the ground and the shower (which was right next to the bed basically) was all-glass and one could see into it from anywhere in the room! Regardless, comfortable room and I did enjoy my time in it (mostly working).One more thing about the room: the view was FANTASTIC! I'm not sure if the hotel is situated where all rooms have great views, but mine was awesome. I was on the 16th floor, so ask for a room on a higher floor of you like cool city views.If you like to use hotel gyms like I do, this hotel has a good one -- and it has a great view of lower Manhattan and New Jersey.There's a restaurant on site (really 2, sort of), but it's hard to navigate. You actually have to go outside of the hotel to enter the restaurant -- which isn't that much of a hassle I guess, but is sort of inconvenient. It was PACKED the entire time I was at the hotel, so I just didn't want to deal with it. You can get the entire menu via room service, so I went that route.As far as the ""other restaurant,"" they have a German Beer Garden (The Standard Biergarten"") which I would've liked to checked out, but it was PACKED and full of hipsters and uppity folks, so I passed.The hotel is located in the Meatpacking district, which was a cool area to walk around and check out. If that's your thing, then FYI.The only issue I had with the hotel from a service standpoint was when I checked out. I had to be at a press conference for a film that started the noon of the day I was checking out. I called the front desk, asked for a late check out and they obliged. When I got back from the press conference, I asked a dude at the front desk to update my key (it wouldn't work after Noon) as I had a late checkout and need to go get my stuff. This guy was, frankly, rude and insinuated that I was going to be charged for another day for trying to check out after the official check out time. Regardless, the hipster dude reluctantly gave me and updated key (without charging me) so I could get retrieve my bags.Bottom line: This is a nice hotel in a cool location, but it's NOT for everyone. If you like trendy hotels frequented by hipsters and folks too cool for school, then this is ABSOLUTELY the place for you. I wouldn't use this hotel for business travel, nor would I stay here during a family vacation.One more word of advice: one of the top floors turns into a dance club at night during weekends. The noise didn't affect me, but it did a few colleagues of mine.","Little Elm, Texas",19,4.0

The suggestion came from a newyorker friend that usually go to The top of the Standard (their roof top bar).The design of the hotel is appropriate to the dynamic area of the MeatPacking distrinct. The view is precious and the block was very entrateining for our age (30's). Problems:- room dirty af (see my picture): the bed is on the carpet, under the bed you find full of hair, caps, menu, organic leftover and whatever you can dream about if you had a stay there in couple. DISGUSTING!!- very unsafe, people from outside use the lift to reach not only the rooftop, but also the other people rooms. Even if the lift works with a badge, I personally saw attendant alloweding people in the floor that are supposed to be only for guests. I was in room 1001 and on the side of my room there was a party in a regular room with about 20 teenager drunk af. It took three hours and four calls at the reception to get rid of them.- after those complaints, a manager told us we got two on five nights discount. At the checkout time nothing was settled on the bill and we had to argue till the check-out time. The guy there was keeping on smiling to us, that was very irritating.- everybody is perfoming a very fake understanding attitude, all they do is smiling to you, but they don't have knowledge of professionalism. - after 7 days, I am still waiting for an estimate cost of a party my Company is thinking to host there, but of course they seem to be too busy for answering.- my credit card still has 2000 dollars deposit for a stay of five nights with a prepayment of almost 300 dollars.

Its in meat packing, which is a trendy area with a ton of bars/restaurants and shopping. It's also pretty centrally located for accessing the rest of the city. What's really great about the location though is it isn't mobbed with a ton of hotels like midtown. Instead, it felt like I was in a real neighborhood but with the comfort of a hotel. The room was also gorgeous with a view that impressed even my friends who live in the city. There is also a certain cache that comes with saying you are staying at The Standard and it definitely got me some eye raises whenever anyone asked where I was for the weekend. However, what really set my stay apart was the staff at the hotel. The concierges Tim and Andrea were amazing. I normally don't bother to take advantage of concierges since their suggestions usually consist of checking out a museum and telling me to grab dinner at TGI Fridays. But both Tim and Andre helped get me into some impressive events. Their knowledge/connections also extended to the entire city and I got some really great tips on places to see in the village and SoHo. Bottom line, if you stay at The Standard take advantage of the concierge. My stay at the hotel did have a slight snafu: a malfunctioning AC unit that took a bit of time to fix. However, what earned the Standard 5-stars was the graciousness of the staff in helping to resolve the issue. Kevin at the front desk was deeply apologetic for the inconvenience and made sure I was well taken care of for the rest of my trip. It was this level of thoughtfulness and sincerity that made The Standard worthwhile.

It isn't perfect, it isn't cheap but the pluses more than make up for the minuses. Plus: The views are the best in NYC. I was on the 13th floor with views over the river and the skyline. The room I had was one of the bigger ones so I was very lucky and was well looked after. The reception staff are amazing and the daily banter was a delight. They were also super helpful and great at making recommendations for fun things to do. The rooftop bar LeBain has stunning views. The Standard Grill had the best burger I had in NYC. The hotel is not stuffy or formal so if you want 5* formality then this is not for you! Cons: The Barstaff in LeBain were some of the rudest people I have ever met in my life and the fact that I didn't leave a tip in USA as they were so rude, is testament to how rude they were. They seem to think they are too cool to serve guests.The room was a little tired in places and the hotel felt in places like it could use a revamp. Some of the evening staff were less friendly than the day and as others have stated the door policy on Top of the Standard is crazy that guests of the hotel can't go up there directly and have to queue after 10pm and are subject to dress police. Le Bain is less dressy but it does attract half of NYC on a hot day to the roof which makes trying to get into the main lift a pain as they all go up to roof and return few hours later drunk. Perhaps guests and non guests could have different entrances all the time as they do at the weekend. As others have stated - lack of coffee machine in the room or even water is a shame.

The staff at the front desk (shoutouts to Kevin and David) were very friendly and funny. The most important part of any hotel to me (besides cleanliness) is the location and this place is in a VERY lively spot if you're into night life. Right around the corner is the Beer garden which we spent the second night chilling at; it was absolutely packed every time we passed by it.

We had a corner room on a low floor and the views were spectacular - sunset over the Hudson and a great view downtown. I love that there is so much light in the rooms and seeing the roofscape of West Village was great too.There is a funky, young vibe to this hotel (the elevator was positively spooky), with a sunset crowd on the rooftop that wasn't our demographic. There is also a more formal cocktail bar with jazz, but we were put off by the ""reserved"" signs on all the tables and the clear indication that we would have to slip someone a substantial tip to be seated. Given the high price of the hotel room we didn't feel like springing extra just to sit in the hotel bar. Some really nice chilling spaces on the ground floor, and both the informal bar/juice area and restaurant were very popular.

The Staff was almost apologetic if there was any problem with the going on's outside, which were few and far between. This is a high end hang out for people in the media and fashion world.

And location-wise, it was. But I definitely do not recommend this hotel if you are trying to get work done in between meetings. It's loud, the walls are terribly thin, and you will find yourself completely exhausted from lack of sleep. Let's start with check-in. I had flown all day, was tired, and ready for bed. Yes, I would say I was little disheveled for such a pretentious hotel, but does that really deserve such a rude welcome? The two greeters only looked at me long enough to see that I probably didn't belong there (at least that's how they made me feel) and was promptly ignored. The lady at the front desk was luke warm to me at best. Fine. Just get me to my room so I don't have to deal with your snotty attitude. Now, the rooms are tasteful and fun. They are small, but this is NY and I wouldn't complain about the size at all. I would even say that would be nice for two people, as long as you don't mind your companion seeing you shower. I hate how dark and damp most NY bathrooms are, so as odd as it is to have your shower in the middle of your room, it was great to have some natural light in the bathroom (though you should draw your shades because people CAN see in the windows during the day). I'm also a huge fan of having the toilet in a separate space. It just feels more sanitary. Back to sleep quality. It's TERRIBLE. I was placed in a room by the elevators, on the 4th floor. All night long (and for my 4 night stay) I heard the elevators go up and down. They give you earplugs, but they did nothing to help. I ended up downloading a white noise app on my phone which helped me finally get to sleep, but should I really need to do that at a nice hotel?. To add to the elevator noise, I got to experience lovely THUMP THUMP of the club upstairs. Yup, the Boom Boom Room is on the 18th floor and I was on the 4th. I could STILL hear it. To make matters worse, whenever the room above me used their shower, it'd hear a ear-piercing LOUD noise from the water and pipes. That was fun at 6am. This hotel is $500 a night and I couldn't sleep hardly at all! Absolutely unacceptable. Other positives and negatives: beds and pillows are good quality and internet worked perfectly. Room service was fast, but food was just okay. The room staff (housecleaning, mini bar attendant, and room service) were all exceptionally friendly and helpful- maybe they should teach their front desk staff the same manners. To be fair, if you are 20something, have expensive shoes, and want a place to party for a weekend, this is your hotel. You'll love it and have fun. If you are just trying to get a good night's sleep and get some work done, stay elsewhere. ","Sunnyvale, CA",32,2.0

Yes the rooms are small, but all the furnishings are scaled down in their way to make is seem cozy, cute and cool. LOVED the superb river and city views! LOVED the black handmade tile bathroom with window between bed and bath. LOVED all the really great vintage/retro style furnishings and the beautiful modern lighting! especially the light fixture shelf type thing over the bed on a riastat. Such a cute little sink! toilet in separate ""closet"" is a great idea. Slim closet w. all you need in there. LOVED the wooden slat ceiling with little curved edges and the big mirror w. curved edges, and and and! The staff were superb. SO friendly 24/7 never an issue. Loved the comfy low bed and all white linens. My ONLY complaint is a safety one: the tub. Its very deep. Its a BIG step over and in. There are no ""handles"" to help and if you take a shower be careful because it is serious slippery! There should be rubber mats in each and every room here. I took a bath cause it freaked me out so much.In so many ways, ever moment is a ""design"" moment at the Standard: the room service tray? sunflower yellow with a molded into the corner little vase for a flower. Numbers on your room adorn your door in a big way. Outdoor light eating area? every seating area, every lighting fixture beautiful, the entire place, the fun lobby, the many different dining rooms (we ate breakfast as the Standard Grill Room) just all great. I think my husband might just always want to stay here after this great stay. The nights were lovely watching the moon and always great people watching on the High Line and the Whitney.

A block is normal during checkin procedure but since my accomodation was pre paid, it was not necessary to do such a high blockage. It is always beneficial to tell the guest what they will do with their card. I complained and they said the blockage will be released in 5 days. Its 12 working days after my checkout (15 working days when all the problems was sorted and the lady at the reception said she will release it. Still blocked.

Nothing worse than saying that you will do something and not doing it.3. Can't distinguish between staff and guest. Trying to be trendy and hip but just seems unprofessional.4.

The usual room rate was upwards of $400-$500. Upon arrival, the valets were friendly. None of the attractive front desk personnel, also with pleasant demeanors, looked a day over the age of 24. We stayed on the 13th or 14th floor. One floor-to-ceiling window facing north. Breathtaking, I'm-the-Queen-of-the-World-type views of the skyline and water to our left, with the Highline park immediately below. Btw, love the park, although the heavy crowds at times make it hard to move, much less jog. Forget about jogging there. Loved the nautical-inspired décor of the room (hand railings on the wall along the room's perimeter, white tables and carpet, shiny wood accents and walls). The ""rain shower"" is located almost in the middle of the room, with fully transparent glass on either side. Fun and sexy, if you don't mind the lack of privacy. A unique shower experience that I haven't had anywhere else. By far, my favorite feature was the video installation in the hotel's dark elevator. The video is a mesmerizing, colorful swirl of clips of pop culture (animals and actors from movies and art). I used the treadmill at the many-mirrored gym. It has a lot of equipment, weights, and decent cardio machines. BEAUTIFUL views facing directly toward the water, the city, and New Jersey (?). At nighttime, we dressed up and at an early hour (10:30 pm) we attempted to gain access to the hotel's nightclub. Alas, at the door to the club's elevator, we were told by the hostess with a fake English accent that ""there's a list"" and we were denied entry for not being on the list, even though we were hotel guests. Other hotel employees had recommended the club, saying that it offers guest access. I didn't mind not getting in, because I wanted to check out other bars and clubs in the area. Not a family-friendly set-up, obviously, and it didn't matter to us. We saw one family during our brief stay. This hotel's intended clientele seems to be trendy young and young-ish adults with money. Obviously the hotel's location is superb. You really can't do any better. The NYC experience is about so much more than the stunning views seen from chic hotel rooms, though. Given the high-end rates at this place, other options should be considered. If you're a tourist of any kind, then - quite easily - you could find another suitably nice hotel in a good location in Manhattan for half the price, and spend the cost savings on delicious food, shopping, museums, a show, table service at a club, whatever.

I had absolutely the best stay at the Standard - Highline from the door service to checking in to the overall ambience it was the perfect location for bringing in my dirty 30 with style and flair. I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about booking my stay-cation at this lofty hotel in such a populated area but the second I pulled up I knew it would be a night to remember. I proceed to check in where I was greeted by Colleen at the front desk who was handling an outright obnoxious patron who clearly taking out his frustration with world on anyone that would listen. I watched her handle the customer who was not letting up such professionalism. When it was my turn I walked up, she greeted me as if she had not just had the customer from HELL. I said my name and was so tempted to plead my case for a better room but I didn't want to be a nag so I waited for here to proceed with the process. She look at my ID and said wait is it your birthday and I replied yes my 30th, she wished me Happy Birthday and even went a little step further. ""She said ""I switched things up for you here your room keys."" To my surprise not only did she upgrade me from a Queen Deluxe to a King Corner Suite she also sent up a bottle of Prosecco which was the cherry on top. I soaked in the tub and sipped Prosecco all night. Thanks Colleen you definitely made my 30th a night to remember.",,0,4.0

I knew The Standard to be the most fun( I have enjoyed their restaurants and bars) but their treatment from Welcome to room upgrade to wine waiting in the room , was beyond all expectations possible.  I had mentioned in my reservation through my beloved Bookings, that it was their wedding night and then said it again at the Checkin with the terrific and charming Andrea Aslo, in concert with the new and lovely Kevin. Andrea started out wishing congratulation to the Brides. He then said he was pleased to offer an upgrade. I was so very thrilled , but I had no idea what was awaiting us! As the doors opened the first thing we saw was a spa tub with a window on the Hudson. Then a turn of the head left, floor to ceiling views of downtown to the Statue of Liberty and turn to the north, city skyline. Carmen Rodriguez of Customer Relations, left a beautiful card wishing The Brides happiness, with a bottle of rose wine with 2 glasses.... Spectacular hardly covers it!

However, we were looking forward to the same type of room we had last time, a Standard Queen, as that room type came with a tub and bubble bath.

It was such an amazing experience - our room was really stylish and had a jaw-dropping view of the High Line and the Empire State. It felt like a really special, cool place - far too cool for this pair of nerdy brits! With the exception of one incredibly rude bouncer at the Top of the Standard bar, the service we received from everyone we came across at this hotel was great - very friendly and polite, especially the nice lady in the shop and the team at the front desk. After waiting a very short time to get in to the Top of the Standard, we headed into the bar for some cocktails before dinner. We were stopped at the inner door to the bar by a bouncer who seemed appalled that I wanted to keep my handbag with me whilst we had a drink and treated us with such contempt that we couldn't quite believe it! And this is coming from a Londoner! He was concerned that I might hang my bag on some of their furniture apparently. I can't say being berated about this in front of a crowd of other customers was the highlight of our evening. Such a stinky, unnecessary attitude which really didn't fit in with the rest of our experience. My handbag and I were 'allowed' inside to get a drink but I felt so hacked off we ended up leaving after a couple of minutes. We visited Le Bain instead and watched the sunset with a few drinks which was great fun and then had dinner at the Standard Grill, which apart from some sandy oysters was yummy. Loved the decor of all of the little bar and cafe areas that were dotted around. It was a great base for exploring Chelsea and the Meatpacking district and we would definitely stay here again. We had to leave at 5am the next morning to catch a flight and one of the staff on duty grabbed us a cab and took all of our luggage out to it for us whilst we checked out - this really took the stress out of the early morning departure and we appreciated it a lot.

We asked to change room and they accommodated us on the other side 15th floor who got an amazing view on the Empire State Building. The Queen deluxe rooms are small but they got a design who could satisfied many. Despite the relatively new and modern construction, the acoustic is not great, you hear everything. The rooftop, the lifts, people walking in the corridor or having parties in their rooms (Frieze week) I'll avoid to stay in rooms close to the lift hall.

This hotel came highly recommended by a friend (RIP, Paul) who had designed the landscaping for the High Line, so when my fiance finally agreed to go back to NYC for a visit (he hates cities and crowds), I knew I wanted to stay in a neighborhood far enough from Times Square that he could see a different side of the city. I've always loved Chelsea, the Village, SoHo & Tribeca, and he's a water lover, so this hotel's location right between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District, with Hudson River views, was just perfect for us. But I had read some of the online reviews and was a little apprehensive that it would be too stuffy or aloof for us, particularly since it was noted as one of the trendiest hotels in one of the hottest, hippest neighborhoods in the city and we're not 20-somethings. Boy, was I wrong! We couldn't have felt more welcome. The warm, friendly service started when I totally screwed up our reservation and discovered a few hours before we were due to arrive that I had accidentally cancelled our reservation at this hotel and had accidentally booked us at their sister hotel in the East Village. Cameron, the reservation agent I spoke with, kindly offered to re-book us at The Standard High Line without a cancellation fee, even though the error was totally my mistake. The corner king room I had originally reserved wasn't available at the last minute though, only a standard queen room was left. She noted my request for an upgrade, and when we arrived, Monique, who promptly greeted us at check-in, provided an upgrade to a deluxe queen room (at full cost, of course), which at least had the Hudson River view I had wanted, along with a huge soaking tub. That tub turned out to be a highlight for my fiance and me! Monique also helped us with walking directions and patiently and politely answered our questions about the hotel and its amenities. We found all of the hotel staff to be incredibly warm and welcoming, from the nighttime security officer stationed by the elevators (you need a room key to enter the area after dark), to the various front desk personnel, bellmen, daytime security officers and the bar and restaurant staff. One night, the ""Living Room"", as the lobby area bar is called, was completely full, so we asked if we could sit on the couches in the main hotel lobby area with our drinks. Not only was this perfectly fine, but the bar staff told us to help ourselves to seats and they sent a server right over to take our order and bring us our drinks there! Our deluxe queen room was small, but quite adequate and clean, with great views of the Hudson River, the High Line, and lower Manhattan, including One World Trade, from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Be aware, the beds are low and the shower is European-style, so the entire bathroom is the shower stall. However, the rain-type of shower head and a glass insert between the sink and shower kept items on the sink from getting soaked. Also, there are wooden louvers between the bathroom and bed/sitting area, which do not close all the way down to the tub level and there is no door to the bathroom, so if you're looking for privacy while bathing, you'll need to either book a single room or have your roommate leave for a while. (The water closet does have a door though.) This wasn't an issue for us, but it may be for some, especially those traveling with children. Perhaps not surprisingly, there were relatively few children staying at the hotel the weekend we were there, and fairly few in the neighborhood overall. Our room was very quiet, possibly because it was at the very end of the hallway (facing the Hudson) and on the 10th floor, well below the nightclub on the roof. I barely heard any hall noise in the mornings - no slamming doors, loud voices, clanging maid carts, and knocking maids, etc. This is a rarity for me; I like to sleep in but am usually rudely awakened by 7am with all the hallway noise. Blessedly, not this time! Our one disappointment was that we never got to experience the hotel's trendy rooftop bar. Both nights we attempted to enter, we were told that it was reserved for members only that evening. Luckily, we did make advance reservations for brunch at The Standard Grill on Sunday afternoon, and thank goodness we did, since it was fully booked by the time we arrived at the hotel. After a late check-out and storing our luggage with the very accommodating front desk staff, we headed to the Grill for a delicious brunch in one of the hottest brunch spots in the city. There, too, we were made to feel very welcome - like regulars even though it was our first time. Our friendly efficient server, Amanda, gave us great tips about the hotel and how to locate special, last minute deals since we're only a couple hours away by car. The Maitre'd, Kevin, heard about our disappointment in not being able to visit the Rooftop Bar and offered to escort us there after brunch. We did visit the very classy and beautiful Rooftop Bar, but Kevin was called away, so he asked a hostess to show us to the elevator up. The brunch was a fabulous ending to a great weekend at The Standard, despite some chilly, wet spring weather. We were made to feel so welcome there that we look forward to a return visit - I plan to make a point of it!","Wyomissing, Pennsylvania",67,5.0

My room had a bathroom with a glass wall so you could see whoever was inside, I loved this cheeky touch and thought it was good fun but more cautious guests might not love this so much.I was on a higher floor meaning that the view was staggeringly good!

First impression not so favourable. As soon as my taxi pulled up outside, a man came rushing over and grabbed my small roller suitcase before I even had a chance to find out who he was. He was dressed like a hipster complete with a beanie so it wasn't clear he was a porter. Fortunately for me, he was so at least someone hadn't run off with my luggage. I do find it annoying though to have porter services 'forced' upon me like that. I asked discreetly at reception what tip, if any, was expected and was told $3, which I paid but found annoying as I can easily take up one small luggage myself and hadn't actually asked for the assistance.That aside, front desk friendly and helpful (and all vey modelesque looking). Loved the hotel decor. I chose The Standard over other nearby hotels like The Dream Hotel because I wanted hotel decor that was contemporary but not too over the top. I felt the hotel got it just right. I loved my room which had amazing views of the Hudson River with its mix of mid century yet contemporary furniture. Room size was small as is the closet and I would say more suited for one with minimal luggage, but I was travelling alone anyway. I was pleased to note that the room had an iron and mini ironing board. However, tea and coffee making facilities were missing which I would have expected from even those hotels not charging $400 a night. Waking up to such a glorious view would have been better had I been able to make myself a cup of tea or coffee. Nice size TV but it was temperamental and I had some issues getting it to switch on sometimes.Overall, really enjoyed my stay and would stay again. It's conveniently located in the Meatpacking District, the High Line and Chelsea Market. One night I called room service and ordered burger and fries, and it was so greasy and tasteless I actually left most of it. Disappointing for a hotel of that standard and it was only a simple burger and fries. I also went up one lunch time to the top floor bar hoping for a drink and to admire the view but I was met by an over dressed lady at the door. I was spoken to so witheringly as she cast her eyes up and down my attire that it was very clear my custom wasn't welcome. That said, our version of cool in London is a little more understated than a floor length thigh splitting gold evening gown and heels at noon, so perhaps i wasn't dressed cool enough for NY standards. I wasn't too disappointed though as I'd never want to spend my money in a bar where the front desk is that judgmental (which really, let's face it, is not really 'cool' behaviour). Those little grievances aside, I did enjoy my stay and would still recommend The Standard and come back again.","London, United Kingdom",18,4.0

It's striking when viewed from afar and has many quirky hipster features indoors. But it is most definitely saved by the fact is it occupies an awesome spot atop the south end of the Highline, an elevated park of great style and beauty alongside the Hudson River very close to the West Village. (The ""meatpacking district"" and there IS a meat distribution firm next door.) Very close to to the Whitney Museum of American Art. The entrance to the hotel is very unobtrusive, on the corner of the building. Through the revolving doors into a space I can only describe as 60s Jetsons. The room I had was very close to the elevator on the 14th floor. (Try not to get a No. 18 room for this reason.) The room had extraordinary views of the river and the village down to the World Trade Center. The room itself was mostly bed, bath and table. All were functional and comfortable but starting to show a bit of wear. A large bathtub had shutters opening to the bed and the views beyond. The toilet is tucked away almost in the closet which is I guess nice if you are sharing the room, which I was not. Nice toiletries and an expensive minibar.The rooms near elevator have a muffled but rather annoying repetitious noise from the up and down of the elevator cars (earplugs were supplied, which should have been a sign). I laughed at some of the other reviews of this hotel charging it with outrageous trendiness and agree that this hotel is almost too hip for its own good but, Wow! the views and location really rock.","Washington, DC",49,4.0

A popular question amongst the meeting attendees was ""what do you think of the hotel?"" Which was usually answered with an eye roll. It's immediately apparent upon entering the lobby this place is trying so very hard to be ""cool"". We knew what we were in for as soon as we entered the small lobby that tried too hard to not look like a lobby. First impression is that this is definitely not a luxury hotel-garish colors and plastic everywhere. The ""reception desk"" was a few podiums manned with some bored looking hipsters on laptops. This led to the elevators where guests were fumbling with their phones to create enough light to see the buttons for the correct floor as there is no light once the elevator doors shut other than the minimal light provided by the odd loop of graphics projected from a pair of viewing boxes on the elevator sides. (Some of those images would be ""interesting"" to explain if you happen to be traveling with young children). We were given room 1014 a ""deluxe "" King room, whatever that is. The view was the best thing about the room, (we overlooked the Whitney Museum). The room itself was on the small side with the majority of the space devoted to a large banquet that would seat 5 or 6 people which would be great if you want to party in a hotel room like a frat boy. Maybe that is the demographic that this hotel is catering to if the bedside literature is any indication....""Please enjoy this nakedly awesome speaker. hook up, get nude, have fun..."" Oy vey. The large flat screen TV was great, when it was working. When we first got to the room we couldn't get the TV to work so we called the front desk. They said they would send someone right up. Nobody ever came but the TV inexplicably started working about an hour later. This happened twice on our 2 night stay but the subsequent times we didn't even bother trying to request service as we knew none would be forthcoming.Room service was prompt for breakfast - continental breakfast with the WORST coffee ever. So bitter and strong it was undrinkable. The bathroom was tiny and poorly lit, making applying makeup impossible. The shower was open to the room so you had to close the black out drapes on the floor to ceiling window wall if you didn't want the patrons of the Whitney to see an extra nude that wasn't part the the collection. The last night of the stay a group of us decided to head up to the rooftop for a night cap and to enjoy the view. Nope. Denied entry, even though we were guests of the hotel. When we complained at the reception ""desk"" we where met with a shrug and an ""explanation"" that the top floor venues were not affiliated with the hotel. Huh? Never again, we'll be booking elsewhere next time we're in NYC.",Los Angeles,45,2.0

The elevators are swanky and as you will see provide entertainment as you view the videos on the screen. A side note that the shower is glassed in and there is no privacy if you are showering . . . so room sharing is good for couples or very good friends. The bars on the roof as well as the ground floor provide for optimum people watching and the Biergarten is definitely a scene to be enjoyed just know it will get crazy packed!

Overall the hotel has a cool vibe, it's a little corky, but that's to be expected from the Standard. Front Desk service was average, nothing bad but not memorable. Service at the bar/lounge (down stairs) was inconsistent. Overall most staff members I encountered seems a bit bothered when asked for help. They were eventually helpful, but it took effort. ""Too cool"" kind of attitude. Upstairs Bar was very exclusive and there was a door guard. Dress your best or you may not get in. Now to the rooms... The room was very clean and housekeeping was very consistent each day. Never had an issue with the cleanliness of the room. The rooms are very tiny. I am use to this, as I stay in NYC often, but this may have been the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The bed is a platform bed that is very low to the ground. It's a firmer mattress, yet comfortable. The overall design and feel of the room was similar to a cabin room on a ship. The bathroom was a big pain.. Wait actually a giant pain. The toilet is in a tiny room by itself, which is fine. The rest of the bathroom is directly across from the toilet. You have to step up to get into the bathroom, not a full step just enough to make you constantly trip and almost fall each time you went in and out. (About 4 inches). It's an open concept bathroom in a very tight space. When you get a shower the entire bathroom floor is covered in water, with no way to prevent. The vanity and sink is also in this space. This creates a big issue if you are trying to shower and your spouse is trying to get ready or use a blow dryer. She couldn't because she would be electricuted. My wife had to take the blow dryer into the room and find an outlet to blow her hair dry. The same issue would arise for someone traveling alone, because the floor remains wet after the shower. The other problem with this is when you are done showering and trying to finish your morning routine. You either have to stay bare foot until you are completely finished in the bathroom (but then you are standing in cold water left over from the shower) or put your shoes on to avoid getting your feet wet. The area is too big to mop up with towels but too small to avoid water going everywhere. I will say the hotel is in excellent proximity to shopping, restaurants, museums, etc. I will personally not stay in this hotel in the future.","Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",3,3.0

I was truly looking forward to my stay here, hoping it would be a relaxing urban retreat.Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.The room was ridiculously tiny and looked like a cruise ship cabin. Nothing in the room could be classified as cozy. The bathroom was industrial and there weren’t any toiletries (particularly concerning due to the price of this hotel). There were pump bottles you could utilize in the shower as if it were a gym.While the room was a big letdown, my biggest complaint is with the attitude of the hostess at “Top of the Standard”. We wanted to stop in for a quick pre-concert drink and were not allowed in due to the ridiculous employee Lily judging my fine black leather sandals as inappropriate for the venue (despite someone exiting right in front of us in sneakers). I am a native New Yorker and really do not need to be judged by ridiculous insignificant employees. Due to Lily, I was embarrassed to be a New Yorker on this day and concerned at how this hotel is treating the guests coming to our city and helping our tourist economy.I wrote a letter to the Hotel Manager Kevin Rockey (twice) and received no reply. Part of the letter is re-printed below in case anyone that works for this hotel cares that the customer service was abominable.On a positive note, the restaurant staff was very friendly and the food at the restaurant is very good.Overall, I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel. There’s nothing about it that would make me overlook the service or room, not even if you scored a decent view. You can stay so many other wonderful places in NYC and if you want, just eat at the restaurant.Letter excerpt:“Dear Mr. Rockey,I stayed at your hotel, the Standard Highline this past Saturday night and I have a major concern about how I was treated.Please be aware, I'm from NYC, I've traveled the world, staying at the finest hotels and was embarrassed to be a New Yorker this past Saturday staying at your hotel.We came up to have a cocktail at the Top of the Standard around 6pm and my fine leather sandals were judged by none other than your employee Lily.I must tell you, I'm not accustomed to being judged, particularly by the likes of Lily and I was more offended than I can put into words.I was embarrassed for you by her behavior and being that I was really only on a ""staycation"", I was embarrassed to be a New Yorker as this is the foot put forward to all the tourists visiting our city.Some other things to note:-Someone exited the ""Top of the Standard"" in sneakers. When I pointed this out to the hostess she denied it although it was staring us in the face. Very concerning.-This same hostess informed me that since I was staying in the hotel I could just “pop” down to my room and change my shoes (I like my shoes, thank you).-Lily was the final Judge on my shoes and declared them inappropriate despite the customer in sneakers.FYI - We spent a fair amount in your establishment enjoying both a late night meal and Brunch the next day at the Standard Grill, where we were pleased with the service. The hosted named Soy was very friendly, professional and hospitable. And while this was my first time staying in your hotel, I have eaten there before.This incident was so infuriating I wanted to bring it to your attention directly so Lily could be disciplined as necessary and made to understand what a fine line you walk when you decide to ""judge"" someone.She needs to understand that you never know who you are ""judging"" and dealing with and it only takes one snap mistake.I know that you have had a very successful career at hotels in both the UK and New York, and I now put my trust in you to rectify this situation.I hope this feedback helps you in maximizing the hospitality provided at your hotel.”",New York,36,2.0

Having said that, I was there with my 10 year old daughter and we had a fantastic time. While it was a shame we couldn't visit the bar on the roof (not the fault of the Standard but strict US drinking laws) we still had an excellent time. Our room had a stunning view of the Hudson and the Financial District (not a hotel for those who suffer from vertigo as the windows are floor to ceiling!). The only downside is that the room has very little storage space for clothes etc. There were about 6 coat hangers and 3 tiny shelves and that was it for the entire room. So that would be my tip for improvement although I am informed that this is entirely in keeping with a New York apartment so maybe that is an unfair criticism! We loved the Standard Grill for breakfast and lunch and especially the lovely lady maitre d's who were so kind to my daughter and always got us a table even when they were really busy. They also really made a fuss of my daughter on her birthday and were just super kind and friendly - we felt totally at home there. We also loved the Biergarten and the free table tennis - very cool! The hotel is in a fantastic location in the meatpacking district with easy walking to the West Village and all its quirky restaurants and bars and also lots of shopping to be had close by. The Highline itself is a lovely walk and for venturing further afield the subway is pretty close by. The only thing I would say on area is that during the week it is an oasis of calm but at the weekend it is ridiculously busy so I would recommend trying to get a couple of week days in your stay as it is a much more pleasant and relaxed stay during the week. It is an interesting hotel in that all its amenities are frequented by locals as restaurants, brunch meeting places, bars etc so it doesn't feel like a normal hotel where you would go down to breakfast and eat with other guests or have a drink in the hotel bar with other guests. It doesn't work like that at all as you are likely to be one of the only hotel guests there so that is unusual but also it shows that it's a popular venue with locals. Overall, it is a great hotel - mainly because it is in such a fantastic location with amazing views so that you can feel great spaciousness in a city that can feel cramped and claustrophobic. I would definitely recommend a stay here. The staff are helpful and were always kind and polite.","London, United Kingdom",68,4.0

We tried to make a reservation for a table and we were told it was fully booked only to find out once upstairs that there was plenty of tables available. The weak point of The Standard Highline is its service. Employees at the front desk and reception are talking and behaving like cold robots.

Staff at check in was very helpful and kind. We had a room on the 13th floor (I haven't seen this in a hotel in a long time) with a killer view of downtown Manhattan, the Whitney and the Hudson. The windows are amazing and the best part of this hotel. The room is smallish, but laid out well- the table and seating was fun and functional. Bathroom- loved the tub with peek through shutters but the shower and sink aren't laid out well and EVERYTHING gets wet. Not a lot of counter space and like one hook for towels. Not ideal. We went out to meet friends and see a show and had a great time. We arrived back at the hotel late and encountered a huge line in the lobby for the rooms. When Le Bain and Top of the Standard open, they close off the lobby from those entrances and have two elevators going to the top, and two to the rooms. Kind of rude if you ask me for people paying lots of money for rooms. (Granted both of those clubs/ bars are fab and I've had a great time there before, but I wanted my bed)! On this night (Dec 19) one elevator was out of service making it even worse. It took probably about 20 mins and packed elevators to get up.Went to bed and realized that the room was super loud. You could hear people next door, smell whatever they were smoking (security did come) and worst of all I could hear the service and passenger elevators all night. ALL night. I'm a heavy sleeper but I didn't sleep well. Room service breakfast was excellent and quick. All in all- a good say but I wouldn't pay what (I think) he paid. However if you download the Standard all you can book rooms day of after 3/4 pm for around $150- totally worth it if in Manhattan and need a quick room.","Stamford, Connecticut",24,3.0

After I booked the hotel I emailed the concierge and got a reply from Tim. He helped me coordinate the entire proposal and also the events for the rest of the 5 days we spent in NYC. I also had about a bunch of things for the proposal (flowers... etc) sent directly to the hotel which the Concierge picked up and held for me. When i arrived everything was waiting for me and I found out that we had been upgraded to an incredible room with a view that took her breath away.

So, besides being lucky enough to work with her, at that time, one of the Hudson Studio rooms was available and she completely took care of me. It was such an amazing room, three walls of floor-to-ceiling windows, a giant tub in the center of the room and plenty of space. Such a great view of the Hudson.

I'd had drinks on the outdoor patio and been to Le Bain before, so I knew the meatpacking/slightly painfully trendy vibe, but it seemed like the rooms with the view of the High Line were the real draw. It just so happened that my boyfriend and I recently needed to get out of our apartment for a night, and found a low rate on the One Night Standard app for the standard queen room, and took the opportunity to book.Totally worth it! The room, while small-ish (but I think totally normal size relative to other NYC hotels), was very chic, with a lovely nautical feel, a giant bathtub, and elegant amenities. And the view was just SPECTACULAR. I can't express how incredible it is to fall asleep and wake up to such a panorama of the city (even for a jaded New Yorker). We also loved the nice touch of having the bathtub open to views of the city as well, made for a great morning soak.Small annoyances: didn't love that hotel guests don't get any sort of special access to the rooftop bar or club, nor would they make reservations for guests on the outdoor patio. The elevators were weirdly slow, leading to very long lines in the lobby. We had some issues with the water temperature control in the room - it was hard to get it to be anything other than scaldingly hot.But on the whole, a wonderfully romantic experience that I'd especially recommend to couples and honeymooners.","New York City, New York",8,5.0

Had heard a lot about it, and been to the rooftop and boom boom previously.I was staying in a standard room and this was 1 of the 2 key let-downs. With the price tag it has, you would think they would have thought of not just the design but also the practicalities. The bathroom design was not thorught-through, for example there was no space for the bin so it kept being in the wa or you had to move it outside of the bathroom. Just small little things like these I expect better from a 5* hotel. Second let-down was actually the service. To be honest, across all hotels in the US I've stayed at this was the lowest level of service.Also, during the evening the fenced off one of the elevators up to the rooms for the outside people going up to the bar...On the other hand, the location is absolutely fantastic not even walking distance as you're in the midst of it! As soon as you get up a couple of floor you get a great view - but honestly most places on Manhattan you get that!For those who care about that - the architecture and design is very nice.Ps. A lot of the standard's glory comes from the rooftop bar/club - don't think just because you're guests at the hotel this will grant you access as I saw happen to some guests unfortunately.","Geneva, Switzerland",47,3.0

If you're looking for an interesting experience, it's worth taking a flyer and trying it out. Very artsy, which is unsurprising given its location in the Meatpacking District. I had a lower floor room, which looked directly out onto the new Whitney building, as well as onto the River, so I had some spectacular sunsets while I was there. There's an adorable mini ice rink at the front of the hotel outside during the colder months, as well as heated seating all around it for those who wish to hang out but not partake in the skating. The rooms are a good size for NYC rooms, and there are very deep separate tubs in each room, which was a nice touch, as were the floor-to-ceiling windows. Decent restaurant attached for breakfast, and a solid bar area for cocktails. Definitely could have used in-room coffee in the mornings, which has become fairly standard in my experience. The front-desk staff was the biggest downer -- not welcoming, cold and borderline rude. But the rest of the stay was quite pleasant. Make SURE you do not get a room anywhere near the elevator.

I know the hotel very well and I know its usually a hit or miss. This time unfortunately it was a miss. I booked a room for 1 night during Valentine's day. Since it was my first Valentine's day with my boyfriend I wanted it to be extra special. For me it was important to get a room with a big tub and an amazing view. I live in Manhattan on the 10th floor of a building and I have a pretty good view, but since this night was special I wanted an epic view. I booked the Deluxe King which isn't their cheapest room. I emailed and called in advance to guarantee I had a great view and that I did not mind paying more to get the best view possible. They assured me it would be great. I got there at 3pm on the dot and the check in line was huge. The lobby was a frenzy. No one offered to help with my luggage. I waited 20 minutes to be helped and was told my room would be ready in another 20 minutes, 40 minutes after checkin time. I finally got my room and it was on the 4th floor. My home views are significantly better. Its like they did it on purpose because I called in advance. Everyone walking the highland could see right inside my room and that was especially awful with what I intended to do on a romantic evening. 2 elevators were broke and I had to wait nearly 15 minutes to go up or down. The Top of the Standard was lovely and so was The Love on Top Package I pre-booked. The next day I woke up wanting to have breakfast in bed and was told they were not doing room service because the elevators were still broken. A day later and they had not fixed it. It took another 20 minutes to go down. The check out line was huge and I wasn't even offered a receipt. The front desk had an awful superior attitude. I love the Standard as an establishment but they ruined my expensive valentine's day (Almost 1k for a night). It gets harder and harder to go there and its such a shame for such a hip, trendy and sexy hotel.","New York City, New York",5,1.0

She coordinated with room service to make sure our champagne and food was placed in the room at the right time and set us up with reservations for the Top of the Standard. She was in constant communication and made sure that everything was set up perfectly.I had reserved the Hudson Studio because the room offered the most amazing views.

The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and the floor-to-ceiling windows provided an amazing view of the entire downtown skyline as well as the Hudson River, all the way down to the Statue of Liberty. I wanted to make the weekend extra-special, so I contacted the hotel staff a couple days before my arrival to set up a few extras. Corey Rae, at the concierge desk, went out of her way to make sure the weekend was perfect. A bottle of Moët and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries were waiting for us when we checked in and she had also made a reservation for us in the cocktail lounge at the top of the Standard for their sunset service. None of this was hard for me to set up - I simply emailed the concierge asking how to go about this and Corey responded and took care of everything. She was friendly and attentive not only throughout the prior email exchange but also for the duration of our stay, where she remembered and addressed me by my name, impressive in and of itself for a hotel this size.Overall, I was very impressed with the Standard High Line.

The interior was very nicely decorated. However, the room was very small with no place to store clothing or luggage. The shower has a big glass wall, so you can look straight into the room, and out of the window to the view. But, there is no shower curtain. When I called the concierge if he could tell me where the converter for my Europe charger was, he told me it was for sale above the minibar. For 'just' $25. Trying to get to the lobby with the elevator is a chore. The roomservice, luggage carriers, cleaning maids and plumbers were taking the guest elevators. We were pushed to the side of the elevator, just to make room for a big cart of dirty linens. I was even asked to leave the elevator, because the cleaning maid was going up, instead of down.When the water pipe on the third floor broke, the elevator was flooded with water and the people who wanted to go down, had to take the stairs. Our friend who is 8 months pregnant, had to walk from the 15th floor down.When we checked out and stored our luggage behind the counter (we had a later flight). A few hours later, we wanted to put our newly bought clothes in there. We weren't allowed to go to our luggage, instead it was brought to us in the lobby. The lobby is almost as small as the regular guest room and it was very crowded. To stand there with unfolded underwear and your personal belongings in the open is unacceptable for any hotel.

On the surface it looks the part, the rooms have been thoughtfully styled and the themed bars and restaurants atmospheric. However, much of what the hotel offers is a glossy veneer with the fundamentals having had corners cut.There are 300 or so rooms and four elevators. That should be fine, apart from in the evening when they close two of the elevators off to paying hotel guests and reserve them for the exclusive use of the top floor bar. When we stayed, one elevator was out of service and yet they still closed two off for the bar, leaving a single elevator to serve the hotel (including room service trolleys and laundry etc). At the price they charge this falls well below the expected service. How can a hotel of this size not have at least two service elevators and enough elevators that guests aren't waiting over ten minutes to get to their room? The lines were crazy.The other shoddy aspect is the lack of soundproofing. Noise from outside was not an issue (which is surprising for the location) so full marks on that front, but the internal soundproofing was well below standard. We could hear conversations in the nextdoor room word-for-word and were woken up by the sound of people running baths/showers in adjacent rooms. Maybe they pulled out the sound insulation to save a bit of money but it speaks volumes that complimentary earplugs are provided.The final gripe is the service. I thought America was built on good customer service, but at this hotel that seems to have been lost in the gloss of being cool. They are all beautiful people for sure, but there was an overwhelming lack of sincerity.

However, the guy who checked us in on the front desk just handed me a black book with info in it and when I asked which room we were in I was told 'it's written down'. I had to ask where the elevator was and we weren't offended any help with one luggage. We had to then stand in line for the elevator. There is no separate elevator for the bar and there were problems with the elevators anyway. One day it took us 15 mins just to get down to the lobby!Our first night we were kept awake until 6am by people partying and smoking marijuana next door (our room stank).

Location - Ideal for a first time traveller to nyc and beyond! Perfectly located on the Highline - it is in the Meatpacking district and walking distance to all the dinner places, cafes and cool areas close by. It is also 2 streets away from the subway - meaning you can easily and quickly get to all the tourist locations across NYC (2 stops Away from Times Square)!!2. Rooms - We got a basic queen room and it was amazing! Whilst small (but not too small, it is nyc after all), the room is as modern as it gets with an unreal shower/bath, amazing bed and incredible views of NYC!!! Not sure what more you could want to add!!3. Accessories (and wow!) - The hotel has so many amazing features!! First the rooftop bar which provides sweeping views of NYC. The German beer hall which is very cool (but can't be heard from your rooms). Very late night dining in its restaurants! And yes, an ice rink during winter! Seriously! In summary, book now (but check the hotels website or Mrandmrssmith.com as they had some amazing deals for room rates ie stay 2 nights and get the third night free) ","Woollahra, Australia",39,5.0

For a friends 60th I had decided to do a 'roof top' bar crawl. Finding nothing around that didn't seem over the top, expensive, or appropriate for the age group, I created my own, the highlight being our stop at the Top Of The Standard. It was perfect in that it was an 'as advertised' rooftop set-up that catered to a more mature crowd. They had plenty of specialty drinks as well as carrying my not so oft carried brand of Jack Daniels. What was not obvious and as a tip for the unsuspecting is that there is a back stair case that leads up to an outdoor terrace which afforded even better views. It was Thanksgiving weekend, so the reason it was not obvious may be because the weather (cold).","Branchburg, New Jersey",104,5.0

The hotel was not bad at all, just not what I was expecting and accustomed to - a more traditional hotel with the usual hotel-like lobby. We arrived on a Friday close to midnight where the nightlife was in full swing. When the limo driver told us, ""This is it, this is your hotel."" I was pretty sure he had the wrong address. It looked more like a club. I asked him to wait for me while I went in to verify. As I entered the very dimly lit lobby with what looked (to me) like club goers, all the more I became sure this was NOT my hotel. I walked up to the counter just to make sure. ""You wouldn't happen to have reservations under *gave my name* would you??"".. The guy checks the system.. ""Ah yes! We've been waiting for you to arrive! Welcome to The Standard!"" I came out to the limo and signaled to my wife that this was indeed it. She walked into the lobby as confused as I was.We were assisted up to our room and as the door was opened, we both looked in and just stood by the door for a few seconds.. everything was just so.. see through. . All glass. We slept with the curtains drawn to enjoy the view of NYC.. Since our room was opposite a building construction, we woke up surprised to see the construction workers (before the actual start of their work) looking right across at us. I rushed to close the curtains. This was also a problem since they had plain view of you doing what it is you're doing in the bathroom as well.All that being said, it was a great experience. The rooms were very clean, the room service food was great, and the staff were all very friendly! I'm sure my wife and I would have loved this hotel even more if we were 15yrs younger (before having our 2 lovely daughters).A very hip and cool hotel!

The shower was interesting, with no enclosure, but it worked fine for me, and the tub was so big, with a window out to the rest of the room that I had to try it, and didn't regret that decision. The gym was fantastic. Awesome views, great running machines and free weights. Best of all was the view on the 17th floor. Sadly, I didn't have time to eat there or go to the rooftop bar, but I did go to Chelsea Market, which was only 2 min walk away.

The only advice I had received was not to stay in the Times Square area as it is WAY too hectic. The second part of that advice was to stay in the Meat Packing District. My GF (now Fiance) and I fancy ourselves to be amateur foodies, with an additional zest for shopping and cool nightspots. For starters ... this area and Hotel were Perfect! After I made the booking online, I had contacted Caitlin in their concierge department. This girl spent so much time with me on the phone and over numerous emails ... she was incredible. She assisted me with some additional celebratory items for our room, dinner suggestions + reservations, guidance on transportation + the subway, even offered some great opinions on other things to do and see based on what I told her we were like! She definitely helped my anxiety level on visiting a place where I was completely out of my travel comfort zone + on top of that had the added pressure of asking my gal to marry me. Once we arrived, the hotel was super cool! The onsite staff - amazing! The front desk staff, bellmen, everyone was helpful, friendly and always upbeat! I have to give a special shout out to the onsite concierge that helped us out as well, Corey. She was sassy, fun, friendly and super helpful! She found us an amazing speak easy, gave us good shopping + restaurant advice and hooked us up with some cool touristy things to do. She made the stay at The Standard more enjoyable and definitely more memorable! To do at the hotel: The Standard Grill was outstanding! We ate here a couple of times ... The Cuban Sandwich + Elaborate Cocktails are must haves. The service was prompt and friendly as well. The Standard Biergarten was also super cool. It is an outdoor covered patio beer hall that has great beer paired food like pretzels + sausage, a large selection of beer, ping pong tables and a great atmosphere! Excellent for an afternoon day of drinking! The Standard Plaza - great little indoor/outdoor spot in the front of the hotel. We traveled in December and the front of the Plaza area is actually a skating rink! Very cool! The cocktails and snacks here were also very good. Some great seasonal warm cocktails and unique small bites style menu. Le Bain - rooftop bar which is a great nightspot on the weekends. Honestly, we partied there on a Friday night ... and my memory is a little foggy. What I can say is that it had a cool atmosphere, great music and the cocktails were flowin! The area of New York that the hotel is in is also very good. Very easy to grab a taxi or an Uber from the front door, hop on the high-line or a 10 minute walk to the subway. The area is also populated with a ton of cool shops, restaurants and bars.I would 100% recommend this hotel. Overall, New York was pretty hectic and overwhelming at times; however, coming back to the Standard each day felt like coming home (my sexy NYC home).

At weekends after 7/8pm there is access only from the public entrance. Firstly do not confuse the Boom Boom room entrance with the nightclub entrance as (rightly) the crowd is different- younger, edgier in the club...more cosmopolitan/mature in the Boom Boom room. The only issue is the attitude of the manageress (situated at the ground floor entrance) and her security staff who do not seem to care about hotel guests and indeed seem to take sadistic pleasure in treating them without respect or courtesy...at odds with the incredible service standard of the hotel staff...this needs attention both in terms of the system for access which is poorly communicated to hotel guests and the absence of normal courtesy which can only be addressed by hiring a suitable managerial replacement. It was embarrassing not only for us but our guests (local friends who have significant status in the NY business community) to be treated in this manner.We have a few days left and will ensure we avoid the public entrances to the rooftop even if it (sadly) means partying off the hotel premises.","London, United Kingdom",0,5.0

The staff at The Standard High Line truly bring joy and enthusiasm to what they do. This is from the concierge, housekeeping, waitstaff, you name it. Our room was fabulous. You can't beat the view, but the little touches are just well thought out -- like the lovely minibar. We had a corner room and it must be said that we were happy we were provided with ear plugs to sleep at night. But, hey, this is NYC and the meatpacking on a weekend! Food at the outdoor cafe and main restaurant were excellent as well. What else can I say? I have stayed at many lovely properties (The Mark, Dorchester, Parrot Cay...) and work in the hospitality industry.

Most importantly though, is the level of service provided by the staff, especially Elijah. We can't thank him enough for helping to plan a very special anniversary celebration. Even before we arrived we knew we'd be well taken care of. He placed us in a corner king room with lovely views of the Empire State Building, the Hudson River, and facing south to the Freedom Tower at the World Trade Center. We were welcomed with delicious tasty treats and wine upon arrival, and again on our anniversary. We've stayed at many highly rated properties all over Manhattan, and The Standard is now our new favorite. There are lots of restaurant options just steps away, but if you decide to dine at the hotel, the food & service at the Standard Grille is amazing, both for breakfast and dinner.We heard absolutely no noise from the nightclub, and hardly any from the street.

Having just stayed at the Standard High Line, however, I did it anyway. Infamous for its floor-to-ceiling windows that afford viewers/voyeurs a glimpse into those rooms whose denizens are daring enough not to close the curtains, the Standard High Line has featured in several movies, and the latest Madonna video, which cements its current pop-culture relevance. There is more at work than trendy hot-spot status, however, and this hotel, perhaps more than traditional stalwart standards, epitomizes New York in the best possible way. Modern style reflects the urban landscape outside the wall of windows, and your room feels like part of the city in ways both energizing and invigorating. Looking over the High Line and new construction, you feel connected, and while some hotels do their best to take you out of the city, the Standard immerses you right in the midst of its vital, beating heart. For the daring and exhibitionist of nature, this is your playground. The shower looks out into the room through a large glass partition (right up against the bed) and there’s no curtain or any way to block the view. Take note, the side of the tub/shower is exceedingly high, even for a nimble person – be careful when entering and exiting. The shower head itself is powerful of force and generous of distribution, and the fragrantly-exquisite bath products are environmentally housed in permanent bottles. Staying with a married male friend necessitated a shower-in-shifts protocol, because neither of us wanted to see the other person’s bits and knobs. Not a big deal, but surely not for everyone. (Hell, I know of married couples who wouldn’t feel comfortable with the set-up.) I gave in and let it all hang out. When in Rome…The rest of the hotel is equally enlivening. Several bars and restaurants line the base of the hotel (and the top floor) presenting options for all. On the weekend I was there, they were just setting up the ice skating rink on one corner of the property. Stylish revelers mulled around in the lobby, festive garland was being hung by the elevators, and a fleet of front desk handlers smiled and greeted guests with efficient aplomb. Some hotels get lost amid their own trendy self-importance – the Standard treats every guest as an elite member of their entourage, and the service and care is impeccable.","Albany, New York",96,4.0

I have stayed in NYC hotels many times, and have seen other beautiful hotels for cheaper.- I didn't like the design of the bathroom: there is no door (toilet is separate behind closed door) so when you take a shower, the draft will make you feel very uncomfortable. There is also a glass wall that separates the shower from the room, so you may not like that if you really like your privacy in the ladies room.- this is not the hotel's fault, but the outside was very noisy when we tried to go to sleep with consistent car honking. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to stay somewhere else where it's not so busy late at night.CONCLUSION: Beautiful, modern hotel, but is simply too expensive and not worth the money, considering there are other hotels in the area (without the hype) that will offer more luxury for a cheaper price.","Northampton, Massachusetts",37,4.0

I finally made it happen this past weekend to celebrate my 25th birthday with friends. I used the Standard app and booked a room for an amazing last minute rate. When I checked in, they gave me a complimentary upgrade. Not sure if it was because it was my birthday but since they have the availability, they given me a deluxe queen on the 17th floor. When I entered the room, it just blew my mind. The Standard rooms are not your ordinary hotel rooms! The view was breathtaking and the room was so accomodating. Since this was a Saturday, security was tight on the premises which made me feel better about who is coming in/out of the hotel. Later on, I had a few friends over to show them the room before we went to Le Bain which is the rooftop bar/club in the Standard. This was the best birthday celebration I had so far and The Standard made it happen! I look forward to staying in this hotel again for fun next year.

Great tips and reservations, they really do their best to make you feel welcome and try to organisize a pleasant stay.Ask for Tim , he is the best.The breakfast and food and cocktails are good. Most of the staff is nice.But some waiters and especially the hostesses in the grill/breakfast are so terribly arrogant. They do not care at all that you are a guest of the hotel. When arriving from Europe with a nasty jetleg being treated that way and trying in vain to get a table was such a dissapointment.The furniture in the cocktail area is getting old and splotchy and needs refurbishment.The rooms are fine, small but everything is there, nice and tidy. Good beds. But... once you move up the noise of the night club is very, very present. In all those times I visited I considered it my own choise to stay in this hip 'disco hotel'. But this year the noise was even worse. So I decided to take a look. But then.... I was refused at the door by a 24 year old , I think one calls this a 'hostess' unpolite, and an attitude ""higher then the standard'. I was with international guests and so terribly embarassed to have taken them there. Business men from Krorea in front of us (also hotel guests) where sent away.Unbelievable to return to your room and have to bear this loud noise.

Months of planning went into making sure everything would be perfect - from assuring that their rooms would be ready to coordinating the meeting and dining areas. I'm happy to say that working with the onsite team at The Standard made what could have been a logistical nightmare seem like a walk in the park. Laura Oakes and her colleague Diem (who heads up the banquet area) took care of all of our dining requests which included arranging for private space for meals and accommodating last minute dietary changes. The High Line Room (where we held our all day meetings on Friday) is an ideal setting because of the enormous terrace outside that allows you to have the best of both worlds and afforded our guests the opportunity to step outside for a breather in between meeting sessions. On Saturday morning we arranged for a private breakfast in the Garden Room and had our own personal chef preparing omelets made to order (very impressive). Now for the rooms - if you can - please request one of the harbor view rooms - the views are simply breathtaking. I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a Luxury corner suite harbor view. Just be prepared for the enormous floor to ceiling windows and the lack of doors (other than on the water closet). All of the rooms come with all possible amenities and we were able to work with Rowan Hand (The Global Sales Manager) and Anya Palaukhina (Manager of Group Events) to secure Harbor view rooms for all of our guests. The weather cooperated (which is rare for the beginning of November) and we were all able to enjoy the fine dining offered in the plaza area in front of the hotel along with the Biergarten and the Top of the Standard. The staff at The Standard are really what make this hotel such a pleasure to visit - any request was promptly seen to and always with a smile.

I love the way it straddles the High Line allowing you to watch the first visitors of the morning through the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall window. I enjoyed being able to walk out the front door of the hotel into a vibrant neighborhood that is within walking distance of several convenient subways lines, some good shopping and restaurants. It was nice to be able to sit outside for a drink in the afternoon or a coffee in the morning or to be able to enjoy brunch at the Standard Grille. What I didn't particularly enjoy was the room itself. The only seating in the room was a banquet seat that was fine for short periods of time but very uncomfortable for lounging or reading, leaving only the bed for relaxing. There was really no place to store clothing during our stay--two small shelves in the closet were the extent of the storage provided so I lived out of my suitcase. Just inside the door to the room was a small, open tub/shower area with an oversized tub on one side, and an open shower on the other. This small tub/shower room was open to the room's entryway and had a louvered window that opened into the bedroom itself. The issues this presented were threefold: first, unless you could open the louvers AND the curtains to the window looking outside (and it was daytime), the shower was very, very dark as the only light source was a small hooded bulb on the wall; second, the shower made a horrible racket; third, because the whole thing was open into the entry hall into the room, it provided no privacy at all.All in all, the room was fine, the restaurant/bar facilities were terrific, and the neighborhood was good but with all the hotel choices available in New York it's not likely that I'll return to the Standard.","baltmore, md",26,4.0

It was a great place to stay. The hotel itself has a cool atmosphere, it is busy and fun. The location is right on the highline, so there is loads to do within a 30 minute radius. The atmosphere in the area a little less intense than downtown, so really nice if you are there for a slightly longer stay.The rooms aren't massive but they really don't need to me. They are perfectly finished and the bluetooth speaker is a nice touch. The view from the room was absolutely stunning, probably the best of any hotel I have ever stayed at.The options for breakfast downstairs, and drinks/dining towards the top of the hotel are great. Highly recommended. The CLStaff at the breakfast area downstairs a little cheeky. Whilst of course tipping is the norm, unless you specifically ask for change they will keep hold of the cash (even if it works out a tip of about 50%). This happened on a couple of occasions and it was a little embarrassing. This isn't to detract from the overall quality of the hotel, or friendliness of the staff. Highly recommended and a really unique place to stay.","London, United Kingdom",9,5.0

This hotel really falls down on the service side - the little things that make your life easier whether travelling for business or pleasure. Room service food consistently arrives cold and late. Substitutions on the menu are not permitted, and the menu is grossly overpriced for what is delivered, even for NY. It's the same story in the downstairs restaurant, a very limited menu poorly executed. There is no comfortable seating in the rooms, a hard bench and an uncomfortable straight backed chair are all that is provided. The tile on the bathroom floor gets very slippery when wet; there is no separate shower box, so that is often. The toiletries are terrible - if like me you pack light and rely on the hotel to have decent shampoo and conditioner, make an exception in this case. The awful hair products plus the $7 drugstore hairdryer meant I walked around the city with rough, crackling hair for three days - I spent $50 on a better hairdryer to get me through the week without having to resort to a pricey daily wash and blowdry at a salon. No water is provided in the rooms for drinking other than the minibar water priced at $6 per bottle. I asked for extra hangers; none were forthcoming. I dislike this place so much that I'm writing this review in the middle of my stay, I still have three days to go and if I had time to find somewhere else I would. Like so many places, this one overcharges and underdelivers. Even the location isn't great when you're here for more than a day or so.

Now the downsides; we tried to book the rooftop bar for a couple of pre-dinner drinks and was told our minimum spend has to be $200+tax per person. Sheer greed. And on arrival on Thursday they told us both the Biergarten and roof top bars were out of bounds for private functions. Greed again!

In the front desk, a trendy girl with yellow hair wont say hello or welcome, but with sad face will give you the room key. Elevators are black, no lights, black buttons and psicodelic films on the walls, hardly will you find the button of your floor. Rooms are small and clean. Quenn bed is pushed into a glass wall of the bathroom, so if you share the bed, one of you need to crowl during night to go to bathroom.

Our concierge person was Elijah, and he was great. This is not an inexpensive hotel, but they make you feel welcome and they take care of you, so the service is commensurate with the pricing. We did eat a light snack at their grill and sitting outside was wonderful. Again, not inexpensive, but a lovely experience. We also had a drink at the rooftop bar which was beautiful inside as well as the extraordinary view. Drinks were pricey, but, again, we expected that. What was a little bit of a surprise was the fact that we were asked if we wanted still or sparkling water as well as our glasses of wine. We said still, and they brought over a bottle of Italian water. And then we were charged $12 for it. I assumed we were just getting 2 glasses of water (tap - which would have been fine). That's really all I wanted, so I was a little shocked at the bill, considering we only had 2 glasses of wine, which were pricey and then paid for a bottle of water that we really didn't want and didn't know we were getting and being charged for. But, it is a minor thing, and now we now to just specify tap water, if that's all we want. The room was lovely and the noise level was very good.

We felt a bit like we were interrupting the staff social gathering that was taking place by the bar. The second time was at 330pm the next day when we wanted drinks/coffees whilst we waited for a taxi to JFK that the reception staff had efficiently organised for us. The seater again didn't seem too pleased to see us and when she did find us a table, and we asked for coffee, she snapped that she didn't take drinks orders and that we needed to wait for the servers to take our order. We waited but they didn't come. Again there was a staff gathering by the bar that didn't include taking our order. After 20 mins we walked out, somewhat disappointed.

Very trendy, and I didn't feel like the V neck on my T-shirt was deep enough. The room was a real surprise - the wall between the shower and the living room is glass and there is no way to cover it up. So, if you're sharing a hotel room with somebody that doesn't normally watch you shower, this may not be the hotel for you. However, after adjusting my attitude I found that the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They seem to show a genuine interest in making sure that you are taken care of. The decor of the room turned out to be a pleasant departure from the usual hotel room. Even the ride in the elevator is fascinating because of the video that is shown on two walls. I almost wanted to just ride the elevator up and down so I could see the rest of the video. The location is really good, plenty of restaurants and clubs in the area and right on the High Line.

The hotel staff was friendly and had our car put in the valet upon arrival, which is an additional charge (not included in room fee). The valet will hold the car for 24 hours, should you require parking. Our room was located on the 10th floor and we were facing midtown (would've preferred downtown though). However, our room was located near a building under construction, so it was a bit of an eyesore. The room itself was nice and spacious enough to spend the night (staycation). Loved the see though glass from the bathroom. The bed and pillows were comfortable, mattress was firm enough and pillows were soft and fluffy. My only problem was operating the shower handle! There's an option for either the tub or shower head, but I kept getting them both on at the same time. Luckily, my boyfriend was able to remedy that.

Felt like a cruise ship stateroom. VERY comfortable king bed, but in a corner, so one person has to crawl in over the foot-end, or crawl over the other person...which may be the intent. The bed is also against a window that separates it from the shower. Not a wall, a huge window! If you have a ""10"" body, it is fun to see and be seen, but at some point you might prefer something frosted when you are taking a shower. The location, places to eatnand drink are all wonderful. Highline is right there, as is the Whitney. Note to management, if you see an older couple come in, give them a room with the walk-in shower rather than the rather risky tall bath that we had to climb into - without handholds of any kind. (We had two rooms, so I know that you have the less sluppery option). Also put a small corner shelf anove the bed where it is against the window wall.

The rooms are indeed small and a challenge for travellers several bags to comfortable find storage. Bed was comfortable but a trial for the person who had to either clamour over the other or out the end. Must be a challenge for housekeeping staff to man overs around a small room, make the bed around all the guests paraphernalia . Bathroom conditions intimate to say the least. We thought there was a scarcity of bathroom amenities. We found the street very noisey at night - even from 15th floor.

The rooms are so small two people can't navigate around unless one is on the bed. The bed itself is not even on a box spring but rather some type of platform. Very uncomfortable. The bathroom is actually gross. The shower is actually the bathroom itself so water goes everywhere and does not drain. So when you are trying to get dressed you either have to soak up the water with a ton of towels or you slosh around in the water left over from the shower. The toilet is literally in a closet so for those of you over 5feet 4 inches this is not a good experience. So my guess is this is a great hotel for the youngest of young adult travelers who are probably used to living in dorm like situations but for anyone over the age of 28 there are much better hotels nearby for the same price.The one great thing about the hotel is the location and nearby restaurants and scene. The Standard Grill is excellent.Hope this helps. Business travelers stay away!!","Jacksonville, Florida",9,2.0

On the ground floor there's two different dining experiences, both great, brunch or dinner. Also on the ground floor there's beer garden with fresh pretzels and ping pong tables. This is an exciting and louder room. Behind the concierge you'll find a sleek little store that you can purchase really cool gear and home decor. Once in the elevator, you enter another dimension. The TVs play a really neat movie to set the vibe. The hotel rooms are all good. I've stayed in the most affordable rooms and top suites. I've enjoyed both. There's also a roof deck and bar to view the city. All in all, I can't say enough great things about The Standard.

Eventually had some help from the bell boy who was challenged by the amount of work he had to do. Went to the reception and checked in.... 'Welcome to NY' was flat as a, well, not a New York stack of pancakes, if you get my drift...we were certainly not superstars arriving so stop expecting too much! Here's your keys and there is the lift! Ok... The rooms are standard... That is what it means... I get it now. Brilliant views and the basic accommodation. Wave to me while I shower everyone! No luxury here. Moving on. The hotel was very busy...it was apparent that it was the place to hang out, be seen or be... A party venue for the locals...we didn't get to the sky bar( indoors) as there were constant private functions. We did manage the roof top outdoor bar. We had to queue with everyone else to get up. No special entrance for guests. The roof top bar was a lot of fun. After a while we came down for a coffee. Where can we have a coffee, I say. Mmmmm are you eating? No, I explain, we have just been on the rooftop and we are guests and we would just like a coffee...Ah, says the waitress, you can have a Starbucks just round the corner.... Mmmm no I say, we are guests in the hotel, where can we sit and have a coffee? Oh she says, you can have it to go..... OH for heaven's sake, I say. Where is the manager? Finally, we are shown to a seating area that was there the whole time. The thing is, the terrace is lovely and we did have breakfast there. It was good but you can't take a table if you are not eating. The brasserie is very good and has a nice buzz. We were booked for five nights but only stayed three. If you are attending a function then stay here for that night only....you probably don't care where you crash. If you are a tourist who wants a NYC welcome stay elsewhere. You can go to The Standard anyway. The reason I say Sub Standard is because the hotel couldn't care less whether we stayed or went. Must be great to get all that business with so little effort.

I had always wanted to walk the High-Line. Since we checked in on one of the hottest days of the summer, we skipped the Line, and decided to bar hop throughout the many fun restaurants and bars located at the Standard and the area. This is where are all the beautiful people have gone. The Standard, located in the Meat Packing District is completely different then where we usually stay in Manhattan. The crowd was young, eclectic and quite sexy. The Standard radiates youth and excitement. My husband called it the ""Universal of New York City for Adults."" We ventured to beer garden, the grill, the Bain, Brass Monkey, the 18th floor. We were giddy. The rooms were unique. I prefer a larger bed, and not on the floor, but it was tolerable. The bathroom was cool, and the views of NYC were unbelievable. We had one issue with our luggage, but the Staff made up for it with a delicious cheese platter, and an apology. One suggestion is that they come up with a map or better guide to restaurants in the hotel, and hours. The other suggestion is the staff needs a uniform or name tag to identify them as staff.

It's definitely a hip and happening place, right in the middle of the action. Being on the High Line is fantastic, we walked it every day we were there. This was a part of NYC I would only be caught dead in years ago, it was like a whole new world was opened up for me to enjoy in my hometown. The restaurants in the area are amazing - Chelsea Market, so close! Our exceedingly clean room faced the Whitney and while the view wasn't stellar, it was a basic good NYC view. The floor to ceiling windows just seal the deal...great light, great space. The bed was very comfortable. However....Recommendation Hesitation 1: Our room, because of it's class and size was actually an ADA room. All the rooms in this class were (Superior? Deluxe? Can't remember.) and while one does give you more room than the other, you get a shower that opens directly into the room with NO door and NO light. Seriously, black tile shower with one teeny tiny light. When I called down to tell the front desk that I couldn't stop the water from rushing out on to the carpet I was told ""that's why we have an extra towel there. So you can put it on the floor to catch the water."" Okay, no big deal, it's not my carpet. The room is so gorgeous otherwise I could ignore that. Luckily though it was just my daughter and I because each night we got full frontal shots of each other as we showered. It might have been a bit more awkward with a friend. (Understatement emoticon). Does that ruin the stay? No, but be aware based on your needs. Hesitation 2: While the front desk folks were clearly eager to please, slightly poser-ish urban chic (and I say that in a good way, it fits the ambiance), the rooftop folks and private function workers need a stern lesson in tact. When I went to the roof early one afternoon to check out the amenties for later in the evening I was recommended to return dressed in different clothes. I had just walked 4 miles on the High Line, of course I'm going to change to go out for the evening! Outrageous!! Same was true for the workers on the private function level (2?). They managed to insult a man on our elevator by presuming he wasn't a part of the function being held there. Spoken quite abruptly with frustration: ""I'm sorry this is a private function!"" as the guest stepped off the elevator. Why would you start like that? Why not say, ""Hi are you here for the X Function?"" Guest was clearly miffed and indicated he was indeed there for the function. I was taken back and it wasn't my exchange. Front desk and concierge, who were attentive and spot on for recommendations, need to train the upper floors on customer service. For this price point there should be much better consistancy. The overall feel for the average guest was unwelcoming. Would I stay here again? Evenutally, maybe. I'm trying something different next month. Do I recommend it? A reserved yes, for it's good points, but I wouldn't say get in at all costs.","houston, tx",19,3.0

(That was an elevated railway converted to a park, great for a walk or, in early morning, for jogging when it's not crowded).I had a room with an excellent view of the river and the One World Trade Center but some rooms do not have that view of course. The room was modeled after one in Europe; small; classy furniture and bathroom fixtures; the toilet in a separate closet. The bath/shower room has no door on it but if it's a couple who are staying here, then I suppose that does not matter. And the standard deluxe rooms are so small, they are really for one person or a couple. This area looks very industrial but has lots of restaurants and spots for night life, so it's very busy from Thursday to Sunday, apparently. The area was not really busy/noisy on Wed. night. (I was there for business.)One complaint: The elevators are SO dark I could not see the numbers on the buttons. Especially when coming in from outdoors on a very bright day; my eyes simply could not adjust. Used my cell phone to light up the buttons a bit.","Toronto, Canada",262,4.0

The meat relocated years ago, making room for the hip, new residential and business establishments that have rapidly taken over the area, booming into the rarified upper regions of Manhattan’s stratospheric real estate ~ in what has been dubbed the “Epicenter of Cultural Happiness” by Esquire Magazine.The Standard is part of a worldwide chain of trendy, chic, new-age hotels. A bold, modern-style architectural statement, straddling the “Highline” (downtown New York’s linear park built on what used to be a train-line serving erstwhile lower Manhattan’s riverfront docks and massive warehousing industry) this establishment hosts a variety of eateries and bars at the street and several other levels, each offering a different cultural and gastronomic experience, and varied aspects of NYCity-life and urban vistas.We had brunch at the Standard Grill, seated outdoors in one of the shaded sidewalk-side arbors covered by green, leafy (and living) vines, offering a cool respite from the clear, fall sunshine. It was a beautiful, quintessential, fall NYC day: a crisp breeze, just a precursor of the coming winter (thinking back now, it didn’t tell us anything about just how severe that would turn out to be) and warm sunshine, throngs of people everywhere, tourists galore, and mad traffic with crazy taxi-drivers everywhere ~ no place to park, but my tiny, fully-electric “Smart-for-two” manages to squeeze into the smallest spaces between two badly parked cars, so it does pretty well in NYC. (BTW ~ I highly recommend everyone get one of these wonderful, nimble machines.)Service is quick (once you find a table…as waits can be lengthy) and very friendly. The food ~ very much up there, and the prices reasonable. (Our waitress pointed out Bill Gates, who was seated indoors with his family, so I suggested she give everyone’ lunch tabs to him, but that didn’t quite work out!!) Had a quick lunch and then visited the Highline Park to enjoy the rest of the afternoon breathing in the fast receding remains of summer.Well worth a longer visit, perhaps to another of the restaurants at this hotel… on our next downtown trip??","New York City, New York",86,5.0

The rooms are small (normal for nyc), but everything is neat and clean. The shower being in the middle of the room was odd though. And the water closet (toilet) smelled weird. Not offensive, more like dirty water or something. It's hard to describe. Luckily it's in its own room so we just kept the door closed. The restaurant (the Standard Grill) had great food that was reasonably priced for the city and the location. And the service was excellent! We were told it was a 35 minute wait but we got a table in 20 minutes or less on a Saturday night. The location is great and there is also a beer garden here, though there was a very long line and the bar worked on tickets you had to buy instead of cash which was odd. My only issues are that around 8pm they close off one hallway near the elevators witha mirrored wall and it's very dark so it seems creepy and because there are floor to ceiling windows in the room, you can hear a lot of street noise, at least from the 6th floor. The line for the discotheque at the hotel ran under our room so when we got back to the room around 1am, you could hear a lot of noise from the people in line.

As an exhibitionist you can show yourself in Adam and Eve outfit to the whole city. Or you can go to the rooftop bar and meet hipsters. Be careful though dress code to get upstairs is a bit tight and line can be long, no hotel guest fast track.Overall: fantastic location, great design, nice bars and restaurant, but a bit crowded: not being able to get a table to have a drink at the hotel bar because it is overcrowded is a bit annoying when you are an hotel guest.","Maastricht, The Netherlands",101,4.0

I would not recommend this hotel to my friends for that reason: * Noise shower: We could hear it anytime somebody was taking a shower next to us. I don't know what's going on with the water pipes, but it's noisy.* Noise staircase: I woke up several times because people from Le Bain were coming down the staircase on heels (between 2AM and 5AM) making loud noises.* Noise boomboomroom/Le Bain: Throughout the entire night of the stay I heard booming music from the BoomBoomRoom or Le Bain. It was a constant annoying noise (beats).* No welcome pack: We were promised a welcome pack but never received one.* Unknowledgeable doorman (did not know the facility since he only worked there for a couple of days). I asked him for some advice on dining in the neighborhood and what the facilities in the hotel were. He did not know. Also I wanted to know whether I could utilize a pool. Again he did not know whether there was a pool available.* Luggage pick up: In the end when we wanted to leave it took 10 minutes to pick up a hand luggage suitcase which should be easy. I am a platinum member at SPG and never experienced that wait time.The most annoying part was that I indicated all of the above concerns to the one at the desk on the day of departure. The only response was ""that's strange...never heard that before. But OK"". That was all. You guys live up the a standard so guests should feel the same. Very disappointing in my case.

This hotel came highly recommended. And I believe and accept that alot of people would like it. Why? I'm not sure. I think the Meat Packing District and the hotel are 'on trend' right now. I just hated it. It was FAR too cool for school. To the point where I wondered if any of the people who designed the hotel had actually done any sort of hospitality training. Whilst aesthetics can be liked or disliked (I personally think that bakelite is no longer used for a reason), the fundamental parts to a hotel should not be caught up in the 'personal taste' section. If a guest is paying over 200dollars, then THE BED NEEDS TO BE COMFY and accessible from both sides. If the guest has paid and been given a NO SMOKING room then...guess what, the room should not stink of smoke. I think these guys were just too cool to care. And considering the night my husband and I spent at this hotel was the only night in NYC and our last night to our honeymoon, we were pretty disappointed. And our room had an awful view, the thing that made us want to go there. And the rooftop that looked so cool we were never able to find.

Livingstone named his discovery of the largest waterfall in the world in honour of Queen Victoria, who took the throne of England at age 18, was bestowed with the title of ""Empress of India"", and became a national icon, identified with strict standards of personal morality and integrity. If we are indeed to believe that history tends to repeat itself, it should be no surprise that 160 years later, I, much like Livingstone, would dedicate as grandiose a discovery to as noble an individual. After a long and arduous journey across the oceans and the jungles of Queens and Manhattan, my exhausted, broken, and confused self gazed in awe at the gleaming structure containing the Standard High Line Hotel. Standing strong, mighty, and glorious much like the natural wonder of Victoria Falls, I was quickly drawn into its inner depths, fueled by a desire for exploration not dissimilar to that of Livingstone all those years ago. How very appropriate to be greated at the front desk by noneother than Victoria herself! As noble, available, and helpful as earhtly possible, she guided me through all the hidden gems offered by this establishment, and did so with unmatched attention and genuine affection.

It is impossible to find hooks/rails anywhere to hang your wet bath towels. Everywhere you turn there is always a door or a corner that gets in your way.

On this visit we upgraded our room and it made a huge difference. We got a corner room with full length windows on each exterior walls with wonderful views. We were over the high line so could also see folks strolling below, we also had a closet that we did not get in the standard room. The bed was comfortable and the amenities nice. There are no small amenity bottles to take home, but full size bottles the hotel refills much more ecological. The shower is large with a rain shower head, but the sink is in the shower which makes it difficult for two to use bathroom at same time to get ready. Also the sink is fashion over function. The spout is a pipe coming out with a flat sink making it tough to get your hands under and more challenging not to splash on yourself. Potty is separated across the hall which is good. Nice flat screen TV, robes but no coffee maker which would have been an appreciated addition. Note there is construction across the street for a high rise so be sure you get a room that won't have view affected. Service here is very casual. When we were last here guests could make reservations for the Boom Boom Room. This time we where told that entry was at the discretion of the door man. Come on now ! We got in and it was not at all crowded what is the fuss! Views are nice. Hotel tends to get younger crowd, location in meat packing makes it a bit noisy.","Laguna Beach, California",169,4.0

It runs right along the High Line which is a cool walking trail/park. The first two nights I stayed in basic queen room and found it very comfortable. If you've every stayed in NYC you know how small the rooms can be and this one is pretty tight too, but at least it had a workable desk for laptop, etc. The last night I was in a spacious one-bedroom, but I didn't find it worth the extravagant price. The service at the hotel is not four star, but the staff was friendly. Certain issues (elevator that didn't work, phone that didn't work, overpowering paint smell on the 17th floor, room service request that never was delivered) were a bit of pain to navigate around and for the price you should expect better. Nevertheless, I'd stay again for the simple fact that there is just so much to do on and around the property. The BIERGARTEN was a personal fave- I was traveling solo so this was a fun place to people watch and I loved that they had ping pong tables for interactive socializing. The Le Bain rooftop bar is a must-see (complete with a creperie!), and the Standara Plaza Grill has such a chic setup for outdoor dining. The decor is funky, odd and erotic.

It was embarrassing. Not sure what the issue was. We were a relatively large group but the service was awful. I checked out and asked to pay for the water I drank from minibar. She actually asked me to wait while they inventoried the mini bar. I said no! Charge me for the water and let me go. I'm a world traveler and this place is at the bottom of my list of places to stay.

Because truly i guess it can be a great place to stay, or rather a disappointment. For those who lived on another planet for the last years, the Standard stands for one of the hippest coolest places in NYC… or used to. (today it seems half of the guests are classic businessmen on a seminar… so i wonder if the place keeps it luster).After a visit at the one in Miami a few years before, i was not over-expecting. To be fair:- rooms are really nice, clean (which seems a must but not always…) and well conceived. The 60s furnitures and style make the cosy, and once you kinda get the idea to close the curtains, you really feel home.But then…:- very noisy: sound insulation is not enough- impossible to get it dark: curtains are not covering enoughBoth points seem details, but yet at this price it is not.Bars & restaurants: - honestly food (breakfast) is rather good, price is OK, service… depends a lot on who you get. It ranged from not very useful to close to perfect. Same for the bar, the best was when the waiter did not know ""pinot noir"" which is about the only wine by the glass….Worth going?Why not if you feel like being super trendy and have the service to match.

So what is it? Well, it's cool (possibly too cool), it's stylish, it's well located and it's now a real destination in itself in New York with the hip crowd flocking to the rooftop bar/club (Le Bain) and to the Grill for brunch. The new Whitney museum next door will only add to this.We have stayed in a number of places in New York but we keep coming back to the Standard. On this occasion we stayed in a Liberty Corner King (we have also previously stayed in an Empire Corner King). The views are stellar, the room is a good size and the decor is minimalist and cool. If you plan on staying here I would strongly recommend shelling out for a corner room for the view.If you are lucky enough to get a room on a high floor (as we did on this occasion) then the Standard can't be beaten. I am less of a fan of the rooms on the lower floors as you are constantly on display to the hordes of people walking along the High Line and the views just don't measure up. The Standard does not differentiate pricing for rooms on low and high floors which is a real oversight. I would rather pay another $100 for a guarantee of being high up with a view than turn up and find myself in an argument with the staff on the front desk.I will stay here again - I recommend you do too (just cross your fingers the staff take a liking to you and give you a room on a high floor).","London, United Kingdom",1,4.0

The combination of cost and mixed reviews has always pushed me another direction but an onsite meeting this week was the prefect opportunity to give it a shot. Spent 2 nights in Queen room 1617 for a conference rate of $400 per night. Checking in at 5 pm on a Tuesday was slow as there was only one agent working and about 6 people in line. Another gentleman finally came out from the back and he did not look at all happy to be there but it made the line move faster. I was told at check in that the rooftop bar was business attire and was ""more or less a private club"" after that. I assume that was code for no 40+ years olds allowed.This room is everything that others have mentioned. For starters, don't think of sharing a room with someone you are not very comfortable with as privacy is non-existent. Rooms are of course all smaller in NY but this would be a tight fit for more than one person over a couple of days. Open air shower faces the tub, bed area and ultimately the great view. Plenty of towels in the rooms which was a nice change and the products they offered were great. It's always nice having the pump bottles on the wall for convenience. Queen bed was comfortable and low to the ground. Small table and seating area were nice for extra space or storage but not all that practical to use. Although we stayed on a Tuesday/Wednesday night, I did not experience ANY noise at any time of the day or night on my floor. Climate control worked flawlessly and the views were stunning. Location is great to enjoy the nearby bars and restaurants. For a good rate it's worth a try but temper your expectations with all of the reviews in here.","Chandler, Arizona",271,3.0

It's a shame that a) they did a rotten job of soundproofing; and b) they manage the hotel for the party people, not the guests. We started on 16th floor, moved to 15th but still too noisy, finally got some sleep on floor 7. They also lie to you at the front desk, tell you you ""might be disturbed if you're a light sleeper,"" but if you check any reviews (which we should've done) the complaints about noise are consistent.

The location was great.... so was the stocked mini-bar and our view. However..... costomer service could be much better. It didn't feel warm here and I didn't feel like we were important at all. They should make their clubs and Restuarants more accessible to their guests. Not makung them wait on an hour line .When your paying $600 a night noone wants to feel like an afterthought.

Room on the 13th floor on a Friday and the night club was literally rocking our room at 2-3AM. Next day we asked to be moved to the other side of the hotel. The view is considered ""not as desirable"" as the other side of the building because of a new building being built next door. The staff was very accommodating and apologetic and moved us to a new room. Super trendy and young vibe. Chelsea Market nearby & great place to get food, drinks or just hang out. The high line is next to The Standard which makes for a great place to walk, run and sight see. There is also a brand new Fine Art Museum a block away that just opened the weekend we were there.Expect to pay trendy hotel prices but well worth it for special weekend getaway or vacation.

Very scene driven & very Andre Balazs who is always on the pulse. Interior designed by quintessential NYC designers, Roman & Williams - the hotel has that 60's-70's retro-chic theme going on (R&W very influenced by Alvar Aalto and it shows greatly here) which makes you feel in the know and a part of the whole vibe of the hotel.The views are amazing pretty much no matter where you are....from your room, the gym, the rooftop bar and especially the very selective Boom, Boom Room (the scene where Carey Mulligan sings in the movie Shame was filmed here). As one reviewer just stated - it IS a sexy hotel (no wonder a movie about a sex addict was filmed here) and it does everything in it's power to stay sexy. NOTE: Guests can go to the Boom Boom room (Top of the Standard) - women have to wear dresses and men in closed toe shoes. It's cocktail attire. They're trying to take you back to a time of piano music jazz crooners and hollywood glamour. Food it TINY & it is insanely expensive ($20 for a cocktail).We liked people watching outside at the Standard Plaza. SERVICE: Staff are all young & beautiful and pleasant. Service is hit or miss. Room service was actually good - very prompt & portion was decent. BOOKING ROOMS: Ask to be as far away from the Club as possible when booking. Be careful! I've actually stayed here quite a few times and this last time was the longest (over a week) and there is barely any nighttime respite from Le Bain nightclub which starts thumping at around 11am but really gets going at 2am. Sure they give you earplugs but if you're people who aren't used to wearing them, they tend to fall out and when that happens you're screwed. The concierge were very patient when we asked to be moved three times (they must be used to that request) and as a result, we ended up in a much more expensive (although stunning) Hudson Suite. It was still noisy but much, much better. The thing is with this hotel - you get sucked into the whole nightlife way of life & have to go along with it as a guest with no choice which for $500-$1000/night based on the room (we had to move 3 times because of the noise) is not really on. It literally dominates the whole hotel. That's the price you pay to be in the Meatpacking District though so know that going in. Location is fab day or night and the hotel plays a massive part in adding to the locations vibe. If you're looking for rest & recuperation - The Standard is not for you. If you're looking for rest at all - The Standard is not for you. If you're looking to party - The Standard is for you. If you want to be in the hub of things, people watching, clubbing, shopping etc. - you'll embrace The Standard and all of it's too cool for school ways. We happened to like The Standard because we were in the mood for NYC and all of it's energy & LOVE the location. Also though, because we spent the 1st week chilling in St. Lucia. If it weren't for that, we would want a quieter hotel for sure. Just know what you're getting into when booking - it's not just a hotel, it's an entire scene. If you're looking to impress visitors who are coming to NYC for the 1st time and want to be in the thick of it (so not your mom& dad!) - this place is as good a start as any in NYC. It'll set the tone.","London, United Kingdom",178,3.0

At about 900 SF, it is one sexy thing!!! Fantastic view of the Empire State Building, the Hudson, the Freedom Tower, not to mention the High Line. The bath tub is huge and next to the bed! The double shower with rain shower and reflective black tiles is awesome. We used the water freely!

The music can be heard, but did not bother us much. We consider it part of the ambiance. It is a non-smoking suite, but whiffs of smoke can be detected, especially in the bedding.

Check in was a bit of a shambles and there was a lot of chaos around reception with missing luggage. My room wasn't ready at check-in time (3pm) but they put me in a different room for a couple of hours while they got my room ready so I could chill out. I was in the Hudson Suite on the 13th Floor. The room was spectacular. Faultless in fact. Incredible views, comfortable, clean, stylish with a free standing bath tub. Very special indeed. What they didn't tell me was that the nightclub on the 18th floor goes on until after 3am on a Sunday night (Thursday to Sunday I believe). So I had a really terrible night sleep. The base / thumping reverberated around my room from 8pm until 330am. It was ok because my first business meeting wasn't until midday so I was able to sleep late. On the Monday when I enquired whether or not there was another event on that night I was advised there was another party that would run from 10pm until 3am. Clearly I was anxious about another bad night sleep. I was moved to another room (the same suite) but on the 9th floor. This was at the hotels suggestion. From that moment on the stay was perfection. I didn't hear any noise from the nightclub and had a wonderful night. All in all I loved this hotel due to the views, comfort and location. The noise from the nightclub is a huge fail - it's ok if you are a 20 something hipster (which I am not!) and having seen a wide variety of people in reception I imagine many wont have been pleased.

There does not seem to be any appreciation of paying guests i.e. residences. From the bar down stairs where you will wait 30 mins for a drink and 45 mins for a table, yes a table! We were staying for 5 nights and every afternoon/evening we had to wait for a table despite the fact we were paying 500 a night!! to the vacant looking and unhelpful staff at front desk it seems like they go out of their to not look after their guests. It seems obvious to me that the staff have not been trained at all in the art of customer service - its not their fault however i highly recommend that management take the staff off to a marriott or westin and get them understand what customer service is. While we got over the lack of service or sense of feeling even a small bit the valued the icing in the cake was the 18th floor bar! Now please note, YOU WILL NOT GET ACCESS TO THIS BAR IN ANY REGULAR WAY. In the 5 nights we got to see it once. Every other night there was a private function. The bar is not run by the hotel which is not advertised,NOTE THE GENERAL MANAGER ( who i believe reads these) - you should make it very clear to guests that you do not run the bar and it is very very unlikely guest will get access to it.Overall i am sorry to say the hotel was poor as a result of its service. While all the staff look cool they unfortunately don't know how to give a top class customer experience. The location is fab and with training and some tweaks the service could be great.","Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",13,2.0

As other views have pointed out the noise can be a problem: I stayed on the 14th floor and could hear the thudding of the nightclub on the top floor, but this was only a problem on one Saturday night. I discovered that simply switching the aircon fan to High was enough to drown out the music with white-noise.The bathroom situation is strange: the shower is behind a large pane of glass without any blind or screen. That's fine if you're alone but if you're a couple you will have to be very comfortable with each other!Generally the hotel is looking a little bit shabby these days and isn't luxurious, but this didn't bother me hugely.The room service food is decent but obviously very expensive (no more or less expensive than most hotels in NY I'm sure). A long delay with a room service order was compensated with a bottle of sparkling water which was fine.","London, United Kingdom",18,4.0

Originally I was only staying for 3 nights and when I add another night that creates two bookings. This is a business trip, I am not here on vacation so I plead that I would be happy not to be upgraded and would rather get settled in the room I am staying in to which I am told there are no rooms of that type available. I am tired so go with the flow.The bellman brings my bags up quickly and I unpack whilst admiring the view of The Hudson and the High Line.The room is odd with the toilet and basin on one side and an open shower on the other. The table top is badly scratched, the ceiling decor is warped and everything is clean but shabby. I check the mini-bar and it is up to scratch.Up early the next morning I go to the gym. The first treadmill is 'blocked' which means it isn't working and then the second one is working but you can't get the TV. But the view is good so I concentrate on my exercise despite a guest sleeping on a yoga mat just a few feet from me (bizarre).Having a shower without a curtain means that you need to be careful that you don't flood the place. Breakfast is served downstairs and I have to speak to 3 people before it is clear who the hostess is. She seats me and the eggs Benedict are fine and served with a decent pot of English breakfast tea. I work using the free wifi at the desk watching the comings and goings on the High Line. I catch the maid and she services my room when I ask which is pleasing.That night I need to eat early before a show and the front desk recommends a great place close by (Fig & Olive) as I head out.It is when you get back post theatre that you realise that as a middle aged woman you are just not young or cool enough to stay here. More priority is given to getting the cool people (who aren't guests) up to the rooftop bar rather than looking after paying guests.Last night I got back late from the theatre and was just about to drift off to sleep when the person next door took a shower and the noise from the water pipes was deafening and that kept me awake for another hour. You can hear doors slamming and people in the hall all night long as well as the noise from the street and nearby clubs and restaurants.As told to I packed up my things this morning and gave the key back assured for the second time that my bags would be moved whilst I was out. I even left a tip to make sure that the move went smoothly.I have just arrived back 4.5 hours since I 'checked out' and have been given the key to my new room but my bags are not here and now they are having trouble locating them!So for what you pay this hotel it is merely a try hard and not in the same league as other hotels in its price point.A very disappointing experience.","Perth, Western Australia",51,3.0

Our phone in our room does not work and our tv remote isn't working properly......we have gone down and informed the front desk now twice about these issues and were told that they would be looked into and corrected......well...we are still waiting!! So this is frustrating. It would be nice to have issues resolved during our stay and not an apology that is useless after.Having said that, we are enjoying our stay...I think your perspective on this hotel definitely depends on your age. I'm in my 40's, 20's something's will have a different take for sure.Location, atmosphere, vibe can not be beat. I'm mesmerized by the elevator. Haven't made it up to the top yet....but restaurants and bars downstairs are fun.Rooms are ok.....nothing to be impressed by...style over substance, but the bed,despite appearance, is extremely comfortable.While the service aspect has been lacking, the staff have been very friendly and generally helpful.

Head up to Top of the Standard for an amazing panorama view of New York but dress impress. They also have a club but we did not visit it. They also have a German beer garden and some nice area to sit outside.only downside, if you travelling for a longer stay, the rooms are not the largest and have really not much room for your clothes.

The word here overall is young and trendy. I don't think anyone here plans to go to the new Whitney. OK I am being unfair. But partying seems to be on the minds of most. there are lots of eating places nearby but many close at 12 midnight at least during the week. Shops abound. But bring money.

I hope this will be helpful to other travelers as there are so many great properties to choose from in NYC. Location: Perfect. In the heart of the Meatpacking district. Many many great shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. Property: Quirky (in a fun, good way) We had a corner king room overlooking the city. More expensive but worth it.Staff: This was a bit surprising. I did not expect the level of friendliness and customer service that we received. Everyone, from front desk to housekeeping staff went out of their way to be helpful and kind.Hotel Restaurant (The Standard Grill) and other eating/cocktail areas: Had several meals at the Standard Grill. Food was great. I will say that the service was slow and sort of unorganized. One person brings water, another person coffee, another person delivers meals....if that system works to the benefit of the customer.... great. It did not though and we were there for breakfast 3 times and dinner once. The wait staff was not overly friendly and did not have the level of customer service commitment that the actual hotel staff had. We will go back though. In fairness, the last breakfast we had was at the bar area and the server/bar tender was fantastic with a higher level of service commitment not seen by us with the other restaurant staff. The living room type lounge area was great for coffee or a drink. It was to chilly to sit outside although would have been great...weather permitting. Service in this area was prompt and efficient.One should note that the hotel is not a quiet property. We stayed on the 5th floor, city view. We used ear plugs, a sound machine and still heard traffic, etc. I would add that I think that is part of the deal if you want to stay in a prime location and will not prevent us from staying again. It was also a bit confusing regarding access to the night club which before 10:00pm is referred to as the rooftop lounge. We never could get in as it was privately rented out. We were not particularly bothered by this but thought it was strange.We look forward to our next visit.","Omaha, Nebraska",32,4.0

We walked everywhere but you don't need to leave the hotel or the hip Meatpacking district if you don't won't to.. The staff went out of their way to make my birthday special and even our lovely cleaner was cheerful, friendly and super-efficient.

Our room was on the 12th floor and we did hear a little music on the Friday and Saturday nights but overall our room was very quiet and we slept brilliantly - comfy beds too, quite firm oh and the room included super-fast wifi! There is no doubting that due to its location, amazing rooftop bar and general coolness the hotel gets swamped at the weekend but this only added to its atmosphere and we were happy to allow the coolness to rub off on us!

There are several great restaurants within walking distance, including the fabulous Chelsea Market. There is fine (if expensive) shopping in the area too. The closeness to the High Line is also a plus. Every visit to this hotel should include at least one walk along the park. My only regret is that I was there in early April, so I missed the summer greenness of the park. There are several subways stops near the hotel, and I could always get a cab, so it is a convenient location for exploring other parts of NYC. The only thing I didn't like was the night club on top of the hotel. The night club is on the 17th floor and my room was on the 14th. I could hear dance music every night as I tried to sleep. It wasn't exactly loud, but it was noticeable and hard to sleep through, even using the set of earplugs provided with the other more typical bathroom supplies. My room was also close to the elevators, so I hear a few groups of loud party-goers coming and going on Saturday night.Altogether, I would definitely stay here again.

They invited me to sit in the bar/ louge and have a drink. So I sat and had a drink. For an hour. When I came to leave they asked me to pay for a second round as 'your room has been ready for 30 minutes'.Rooms: I was in a corner room. You walk in and the view is great. But I don't need a great view. I need a quiet, private, execllently appointed room. I think the rooms are Ikea + in terms of fit out. Little things - rubblish flat hangers. I am a business traveller who wears suits. I don'twant to hand my suit on a cheap white plywood hanger. I want a high quality, shaped wooden hanger.

I spent two days arguing and looking for my belonging that the bell boy lost. The manager was of no help at all. She claims to be new and certainly acted the part. There was no compensation, no relief, and no satisfaction. She even asked me to fill in an incidient report. When I asked what help that would be, she explained that it was only for the hotel's records and it would have no affect in solving anything for the clients at all. After searching everywhere in the room for the missing bag, I went to see the reception staff again. They said I needed a ticket to get access to my car. I went back and gave them the ticket. Then, they gave me directions to the parkign garage, which was about 10 mins away. Of the staff of 5 people at the front desk, guess how many of them offered to accompany me to the large underground garage to search for my bag that they lost / forgot to bring out of the car? NONE! None of them actually offered to provide service to at least bring me to my car or drive it to the hotel for me to find the missing bag of stuff. I also did not care for the room style. Maybe we were taller than average or because they put us in a handicap room (that we didn`t ask for) but all the furniture was very short. We needed to request to be put in a standard room that was available....I don`t know why they didn`t put us in the room we reserved. Checking in at 1AM, this is not the ordeal any guests should have to go through due to the hotel's lack of competence and attention to detail. The bed was only 1 foot from the ground. It felt like sleeping on an air mattress when camping. The hotel does not provide any cot for extra guests as this is not meant for families or friends - just couples or business trips.My least faourite part of the room was the fact that teh shower was separate from the toilet. The toilet had it`s own room but the shower had a 3 wall section on the other side of the hall. I did not care for this design because I thought it was awkward to step out to the big window....because there was no other area to dry off. The window needed to be left open for the most part because the room itself was very very dim in terms of lighting. So you have the choice to dry off in front of the window, inside the wet shower or in dim lighting with the curtains closed. A few good notes:The pricey restaurant, Standard Grill, is quite good. You can make reservations via OpenTable too. The waitors are very friendly. The cleaning staff was very attentitive and receptive. The area is very convenient. It is 3 blocks from the metro/subway and it is close to many bars, restaurants, and highline trial walk. I have stayed at the W, the Westin, and various Marriotts, this was by far the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed in! The Standard is the worst hotel in New York City!","Montreal, Canada",17,1.0

Smart, quick (most of our questions were fired at rapid speed as we were exiting the revolving doors of the lobby!), well-travelled (so he understands the stresses & strains of travel) & charismatic, Elijah was diplomatic, funny & brilliant.

We could hear a little bass at night, but not enough to be a problem. The room was big enough with a bed, sitting area and bar are. The peek-a-boo shower is really cool. Taking a hot shower while looking at that view of the Empire State Building was awesome. A construction worker or two probably got a glimpse, but oh well.

It was a nice stay and the location right over the High Line is quite lovely, even in freezing winter. It must be fabulous in the spring and summer. The vibe is definitely one of deep-pocketed people; but I found the front desk staff gracious and helpful. The room is NOT for platonic friends! I didn't read the other reviews but surely many must have commented that the shower is in full view of the rest of the room--it's simply behind glass, but that's it. So make sure you are solo or with a romantic partner. The decor was sleek. A bit too sleek, actually, in that the wee garbage cans couldn't really fit anything wider than say, a soda can. So I had to leave my takeout container sitting on the counter. Also, there were no racks to hang hand towels in the sink area. I liked the toiletries. The bed was comfortable, the room and floor were quiet. They asked me at check if I'd prefer more quiet, and if so, to opt for a middle-range floor, since the club is at the top. The toilet is as a WC, so could be an issue for people on the claustrophobic side. A friend and I hung out in the beer garden a bit and played foosball--win!

Very trendy with a younger crowd (25-40). Skating rink for young families located right at the hotel. Located in the old meat packing district. Lots of renovation going on in the area. Doesn't appear that there is much in the way of nearby shopping. As busy as the restaurants were on a Sunday afternoon, it's obviously a destination spot for locals.For people north of 55 this hotel, while very nice and modern, might present a few challenges.  The Staff: Sarah at the front desk was very helpful on check-in and was able to get me in my room for an early check-in. Much appreciated! Staff has all been friendly and very responsive. The restaurants The Plaza lounge, The Standard Grill and Biergarten (all reviewed separately) are nice venues with great food). Special thanks to Kristine, the DJ in the Plaza lounge, who saw I was a 'north of 60' guy sitting by myself in the lounge in the mid-afternoon. Out of the blue she put on an entire mix of Golden Oldies. since I was about the only person in the lounge. Wonderful experience! Well done Kristine!Room: Clean, neat and bright despite facing northeast. I'd suggest trying for a more southern exposure with a view of the Hudson. My 7th floor NE facing room is staring at a new high rise under construction 40 yards away. The room was very small (photo attached) with no dresser and nowhere to put your clothes, except for a teeny closet and one shelf beneath the safe in the mini-bar (well-stocked). High, wood-trimmed ceiling, floor to ceiling windows and large mirrors helped give an impression of more space. It would be very tough for a couple with baggage to have an extended stay, due to the room size and lack of storage for bags or clothes.The shower and sink area are wide open for all to see. The crystal clear glassed-in shower is literally 14 inches from the side of the bed. There is zero privacy, except in the commode. Might be fun for a couple if your' re a 25 year old hard body, or like to shower together. If not....there's nowhere to hide. Not a place to hang a towel in the place except room space for one towel over a small piece of glass in the shower. The mattress sits basically right on the floor. Lots of fun struggling up out of. The king bed was very comfortable though, with four great pillows. There's a single small (uncomfortable) couch (the only place to put your bag) and tiny chair and table in the room. For such a modern hotel, one of the strangest things was the lack of outlets to charge your electronics. If you travel with more than two devices, bring a multi-charger. One outlet in the bedroom area and one in the bathroom, that's it...I dragged the table across the room to be near the outlet. By the time I finished this review, the chair was killing me. There are earplugs on the bathroom sink for a reason. Until 3AM I could hear music vibrating through the bed, despite wearing the earplugs and having bad hearing too boot. Couldn't tell where it was coming from.Tip: Safe in the room is a bit different. Enter your code and then first hit the Enter button before hitting the Close button.Miscellaneous: You can print to the front desk from your room and there's a business center also.Nice fitness facility on the 17th floor with great views of the Hudson. No heavy iron, just dumbbells up to about 50 pounds and an interesting multi-exercise electrically controlled resistance training station. Treadmills and bikes with great views.Need to use your key card to access your floor. Elevators have neat 3D display panels, but the keys are black on black and really difficult to see in a dark elevator. Two high-end clubs, The Top of the Standard and Le Bain on the 18th floor. Did a daytime walk-through and they are beautiful. Access is complicated by members-only hours at Top of the Standard and I understand that you have to wait in line downstairs to gain access later in the evening. Check with hotel reservations to figure it out. I didn't give it a try.","Anchorage, Alaska",18,3.0

It's spacious enough that two people can function in the space, eat room service, enjoy the view. There is a floor to ceiling wall of glass in this room category, overlooking the Hudson river, the view is gorgeous. - the bathtub is huge, easily big enough for two, and you can see out through wood shutters to look at the view of the Hudson.- the shower had good pressure and the entire bath/shower area design is clever- there are quite a few mirrors in the room that are discreet/unobtrusive while adding to the sexy, playful, fun aesthetic. - the bed is low and comfortable, medium firm. - bath products are kiss my face (natural) which are good- our room service dinners each night were delivered within 20 minutes or less and were delicious- an electric kettle, soy milk, tea cups etc were provided on request. - the heating system was good - no easy feat given all the glass and winter temps- our room was quiet, slept great.Cons:- TV HDMI plug is not exposed so engineering had to come and dismantle the frame for me to plug in my Laptop. This is an unfortunate design flaw/oversight. Engineering were very nice. - room is fully carpeted except for the shower/bathroom. Fortunately I didn't get allergies (it feels very clean) but I do think there are lots of fibers floating about the air/atmosphere of the room. Plus, it's all light colored carpet, pale upholstery so I did get some pale lint/fibers on my black clothes.I had a great experience - it was fun & relaxing staycation.

I was pleased when my room was ready at midday. Check in was very fast and the staff were really polite and happy. I loved the design of the room with the doorless bathroom looking over the bed. Not very private if there was more than one person in the room but fun for a business traveller. WIFI was good and everything was very clean. Where was the kettle for my morning tea? Seems a weird amenity to omit. So I've covered the positive aspects. There was a lot of banging especially early in the morning as other guests let their doors slam and noisily chatted to each other outside of my door but that's not the hotel's fault. There were trays of room service food piled in my corridor for the entire length of my stay which is a bit disgusting and not something I have ever come across before. But the reason I am giving The Standard the worst rating I have ever given on Trip Advisor is for the temperature of the room. I turned the noisy AC/heater off before I went to bed on the first night. I woke up in the night, freezing cold, and put the heater on and was able to go back to sleep having been awake for 24 hours on a long haul flight. Just to mention I never normally wake up in the night. When I woke up in the morning the room was cold and the heater had turned off. I didn't spend any time in the room except to sleep and shower in the mornings. When I got back in the early hours for my second night the carbon monoxide alarm was going off. I don't know how long it had been going off for but my neighbours must have been able to hear it. It was so loud. I called reception and within 10 minutes they sent a very polite handy man to change the battery and stop the alarm. Learning my mistake from the previous night, I put the heater on before I went to sleep. I woke up at 3am shivering with cold. I checked the temperature and it was on 60 degrees (15C) pumping out freezing air. This was the lowest temperature on the gauge so it may have been colder than this in the room but couldn't register. I tried to increase the temperature but no heat came out. It was Sunday 15th February, the coldest day on record for NY in years. In my tired/jet lagged state I thought the room must be so cold as it was so cold outside. Obviously upon reflection, the AC was faulty. I knew the hotel was fully booked so I wouldn't be able to move rooms and I didn't want to go through the hassle twice in one night of calling the handy man again so I just put my coat, hat, gloves and scarf on and tried to go to sleep. I finally managed to sleep for an hour at 6am and was then woken by banging from neighbours' doors again. The bathroom floor was so cold, I had to lay a trail of towels down just so I could walk on it. When I checked out the reception was much busier and I had to queue. I complained about the temperature in my room and suggested they fix it before the next person checked in later in the day. The woman was really dismissive and although she apologised she wasn't even listening, just trying to process me as fast as possible. I was so tired and really quite angry and just wanted to get out of the hotel and warm up in the minus 16C outside. Unfortunately the room had been pre-paid by my company or I would have refused to pay. I am now trying to get a refund. I would stay at this hotel again as it must just have been bad luck. The location is good. Most of the staff were really nice and the rooms are really well designed. If I'm ever in the same situation again I will be sure to raise an enormous fuss and insist on a change of room. ",,28,1.0

Turns out I was upgraded my first stay, and I keep going back, hoping it will happen again. It hasn't. The rooms are very small, and there aren't a lot of places to put things away.That said, The Standard is a lot of fun. Not only is it in a great local and has gorgeous views, but it's also home to the Boom Boom room, Top of the Standard, and Standard Grill. This was my fourth try to get into Standard Bingo, and we got in! Though it's pretty late for a Sunday night (reservations start at 10:30), it was a lot of rowdy fun I will not soon forget. We also got a table at Top of the Standard with my teammates. Very classy, great drinks (though expensive), and again, gorgeous views. Ask for the back area if you can. Even though a few of us were staying at the hotel, we had a lot of problems getting in. Even though we were before 9pm (when they turn services over for late night, meaning limited elevator access and having to wait in a line just off the hotel), they kept shepherding us away from the elevators, making us move to place to place, and were a bit rude. If you go, go before 9pm.Their elevator situation is quite a puzzle. They cut them off and make you walk all the way around at odd hours I couldn't figure out. At certain times only two elevators were working, and there was a long line just to go up them (no, they were not for the Boom Boom Room or The Top of the Standard). Strange experience for hotel guests, and with only two working elevators during those times, it takes a long time.At this visit, they had a few wrapped snacks waiting for me along with a pair of ice skating tickets. Very nice touch.Overall, every time I stay here I say to myself ""this is the last time"" but I'm a sucker for entertainment and the hope of that one-off upgrade, and I keep coming back. My biggest complaint about this hotel is the lack of space to put things. If I'm staying somewhere a week, I expect some type of storage mechanism for my clothes. Their tiny options just don't cut it. But, again, I keep on coming back.","San Francisco, California",27,4.0

It has far more personality than a standard chain hotel, but far better amenities than a typical boutique hotel (a good gym, very good restaurant, easy access to cabs and the subway).The rooms are stylish, modern and offer great views, while still delivering on the practicality that you need as a business traveller (a good bed, a table to work on and enough space to unwind). But the best feature of all has to be the hotel's location right atop the remarkable High Line park. And, if you're a runner, the riverfront running/cycling path is essentially right outside the door.Random tip: Try to get a room with a tub—they're bigger and the tub itself is excellent.

When we pulled up the door was not opened for us, not a big deal but others in the area do this and it is a SERVICE business. Pricing not an issue as we have paid the same and 5x's as much for rooms around NY and the world, But !!! For the price you basically get a poorly designed and dinged up closet size room with scratched and dinged up furniture and hinges that were loose above the mini bar making the door hang, phone receiver did not work (I'd rather use my cell) No room for larger luggage etc.Our Bellmen very nice asian fellow, was to good for this level of hotel, he belongs in a better place PERIOD.Front desk nice people at check in with dingy collared shirts sloppy looking (trendy but not nice sloppy actually) I love style and trend as I have always been into style and fashion but first impression NOT impressed.15th floor, hallways dirty, carpet dinged, walls scratched, doors nice...Walk in the room, smaller than small even for NY. The standards pictures on line don't believe. Nice floor to ceiling windows, use shades for privacy. Housekeeping does bad job and they obviously don't report to managment what needs to be addressed. Shame on managment ( accountability 101 )...Top of the standard is the only great thing at the hotel, we have been many many times, Not an issue to get in for us, hate to be so blunt but we look good, come correct and spend the right money!...Don't drink at anything on the lobby level, my wife and I enjoy Vodka club soda with a splash BUT what is served is club soda with a splash with no or barley a scent of vodka, I asked the bartender to put in a glass extra vodka, some Grey Goose and then some Kettle one, he poured a half glass and they were watered down.. PS.I have friends in the area and in the business who confirm but besides that my taste buds don't LIE....Drink wine or beer a save the trouble, 15 bucks per drink is not a big deal to us, you can charge me 30 I could care less, but don't screw me and if you do screw me at lest kiss me xoxoxo....Check out, was given someone else's bill pay attention you always should anywhere you go.The valet pulled my car up and didn't offer to load my bags in the car Oh well! no tip then!! he must be loaded or own the dumpster outside.I will copy and past this on other sites and save it and paste every month as this place is a true dumpster dive. for those who come from over seas, spend your money elsewhere. a two star hotel may be a good recommendation to stay if you looking to stay in this meat bucket in th meat packing.Sharon Osbourne was right!!!

The soaking tub with views of the city is a relaxing treat. We were on the 12th floor & the room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had breakfast at the Standard Grill. Food and breakfast cocktails were yummy. Biergarten is a nice casual bar. Friday evening cocktails at Top of the Standard was excellent! Great live jazz band, phenomenal views and unique cocktail menu. The first time we stayed, the bass from the nightclub kept us awake. This time it did not bother us. As for admittance to the nightclub -- it's typical in NYC, suck it up and wait to see if you are admitted. Or find some other place for a fabulous evening out, as we did.

Don't miss out on the crepe station located in the rooftop club which during the day is also open - best in NYC.

Since the Standard was right around the corner, the grooms suggested their guest stay there and got us an attractive rate of $230 a night. I contacted the concierge and had a wonderful chat and they arranged a car service to pick me up and drop me off from LaGuardia and applied the charges (including tip) to my bill. I have to admit, I loved the service and the idea of not having to deal with paying/tipping, just get out and go.When I arrived, room was not read, so I was okay with that since I met two gentlemen on the plane who could not say enough about the Standard Grill, so I went. But that's another review, I will write that after this one.The hotel is hip, trendy, in the Meat Packing District, ice skating rink smack dab in front - I was impressed. Tiny, efficient lobby and desk clerks were very attentive. So, needless to say, my lunch was not doing so well, so I really needed that room. Got the key and went up. OMG, one side of the bed was against the wall - that did not make me happy, plus the damn thing was about 4 inches from the floor. This hotel is NOT for somebody in their 60's. If you like bending down and rolling over on the floor to get out of the bed, this might be for you.They could not change rooms because the other rooms, same issue - they do not offer two beds. I knew this before I went; my girlfriend and I were sharing the room. Who, in their right mind wants to crawl into a bed up against the wall??? I had the outside because I needed the bathroom, duhhh, read the restaurant review.Okay, I am just not that young, nor was my ""roomie"". The bed slept okay, the room, although tiny, was very efficient, if you like living out of your suitcase - there was no where to unpack anything and barely space for cosmetics and hair products for two women.I love, love, love the area; but just DO NOT RECOMMEND this hotel for mature people who do not want crawl over each other, nor sleep that close to the floor. Staff was very nice and helpful. I should have known something checking in, the only people I saw were the thirty something crowd. I got it now.Note: I did get sick and the staff tried to accommodate me as best they could.","Miami, Florida",18,3.0

We planned to skate, sip hot chocolate and sleep in: the next morning we laughed that we were, typically, 0 for 3. Instead, we marveled at the view, ate out in the neighborhood, and fell asleep early. We each managed to squeeze in soaks in the tub and insanely long showers. We ordered up savory (hers) and sweet (mine) breakfasts. Her eggs? ""Life,"" was my grown-kid's assessment. My French toast? Genius. More stuff we loved: *the laid back, pretty staff;*being able to see the Statue of Liberty; *the laugh factor in seeing the NYC Department of Sanitation;*all of the bath products; *the (hooded! black!) robes;*ear plugs;*the speedy wifi (my daughter, especially);* watching Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child all morning.Stuff we might have done differently:*ordered a midnight snack (fries);*opted for a king room (the queen was darling, but still);*managed to skate early in the morning before check out (instead of pocketing our voucher with a vow to return later this season).Overall, we agreed that our stay was hilarious, fast, and a bit much.

I was really looking forward to going to The Standard for Christmas holidays: in the past years I've tried Americano and Gansevoort, I've been uncertain because there were new hotels in the area since I came the last time. As it was a kind of honeymoon I decided to go for what is still considered one of the best location in town (or in West village area) and made a reservation for a superior king. We figured we were going to an heavenly place with wonderful sightseeing, polite employees, top food, narrow but comfortable rooms. Unfortunately, too many things were stacked up against them for me to give them a good review.First, we've been given a room on 14th floor, n. 1403. The view was amazing, really. There wasn't a wardrobe or a closet but only a tiny recess entering the room and two shelves in the piece of furniture hosting bar, safe, refrigerator and snack. We've unpacked only coat, jackets and shirts and left everything else in the luggage (a choice that resulted useful on the second day of our stay). Taking a bath watching the Empire state building, with foam all over was great (complimentary soap, shampoo, conditioner, cream were the highest quality), wonderful sheets and pillows and soft towels in the bathroom. Unfortunately air conditioner / heater, that we switched off immediately, continued to make noise as if it was at set the highest. We ask assistance, then we went for a walk. We came back at 8 p.m. and the noise was still awful, we went downstairs at the grill for dinner (the Christmas menu was pretty good, the steak ordered by my BF was decent), passing at the Concierge to submit again a complain and ask the intervention of a technician. We've been told for the second time an engineer would have solved the problem. After dinner, pretty tired because of flight, we went back to room; before taking the elevator we asked the concierge about the noise coming form the AC hose: the lady assured us it was solved. Of course it was not and we didn't sleep: it seemed we were still on the plane, as the night before, during the flight from Italy. the following day we asked for the third time to fix the problem and the arrogant Nadine, in a roundabout way, explained me I was a stupid tourist bothering her, ""who has so many things to do and can't loose her precious time with a person who is here today and not tomorrow"". Being treated like a stupid because you complain of intolerable noise and, most of all, because twice we've been told the problem was already fixed, is not funny when you pay a significant amount of money to sleep in a tiny room with a fabulous view. Anyhow Nadine, in her unlimited tolerance, right after an hysteric attack, told us she would have called an engineer to fix the problem. I really did hope he wasn't the same guy supposed to have fixed the problem the two previous time. We came back at 9 p.m. and asked if the problem was solved, we've been replied it was and we were reassured by the kind and polite guy that took care of our luggage on arrival. I asked him to follow us in the room but smiling he replied there was no need because everything was ok. Of course it wasn't. Tired and deject we called the reception and after the umpteenth explanation of the problem (spending holidays on a plane is not this comfortable), we've been contact by the manager that offered a change of room. He was kind and explained the problem could be solved only breaking down the wall (or the ceiling), therefore he offered us to change the room, eleventh floor room 1105, same view, same category. He gave us the chance to change immediately or the following morning. As we were really tired due to two sleepless night in a row we decided to change the following morning. Now I'm no t severe, but this an pricy hotel, not an hostel, but I'm still arguing why three people took the liberty to fool me saying the problem was solved when the only solution was change the room and break the wall? The following morning, after another sleepless night, at 6.30 I was at the reception to get the key of the room promised by the manager. I've been told by two guys both kind and polite, that the room was still occupied and we couldn't move before 3/4 p.m. They could offer immediately only a room at 5th floor, which I refused having paid for a superior room. Anyhow we packed our bags and decided to go to Metropolitan museum. When we came back at the hotel, in our new room (1105) our bags were moved, we unpacked and a shower, than lied for a while. We suddenly heard water flowing and ran to the bathroom because we were afraid the toilet was broken. Fortunately it was not, or unfortunately: it was the noise of the shower of our neighbour. We were lucky because he was taking shower at normal hours 7 p.m. or 8 a.m. in the morning (except one morning at 5 a.m.) so the loud noise wasn't a huge problem but I still can't believe there's so little sound proofing in and between the rooms: it really seemed that neighbours were having shower in our room. During our stay, except for Nadine, the staff has been kind and polite: great breakfast at the grill on January 1st, they kept our luggage stored when we went to Avis to get the car (we moved to Washington on January 2nd), the pillows and the bathrobe were the best ever experienced and the view from the room, the bar at 18th and the gym were really amazing.Overall, we were very disappointed for the noise and service, meaning with service the management of the noise from AC hose. When you're paying this much for an hotel room, you expect top notch everything and on sound proofing and problem solving everything was very mediocre and disappointing. I will not be coming back and will be advising against this place. I highly recommend that you take your money elsewhere, unless you decide to accept a significant compromise to enjoy the breath taking view from your hotel room.","Bologna, Italy",31,2.0

Hip and trendy! Fun stay in Meat Packing district. I had to come to Manhattan in the midst of a cold front for a deposition from my home in Marin ( Northern California). Just two months ago I had come for a little vacation with my daughter Danille. We chose the Dream hotel in Chelsea and I fell in love with Chelsea Market and the high line. Since I chose my hotel as a way to explore a neighborhood, for my husband and I this trip I chose The Standard.What a pleasant experience. While the room is smaller than the Dream... It's tiny... We don't mind at all. My husband is a big guy.. 6'4""... But he's okay with the size. That's because it's so well designed with mirrors and glass. It's modern and sleek and really functional. Besides, we are on the 11 th floor and have an amazing view of the Empire State Building! Magnificent at night. And the room is very quiet, a welcome change from the Dream.We made a mistake our first night here and thought of trying out the rooftop bar at 9 pm. The euro trash crowd was in full swing. The hostess wisely advised us to come back another day at 4 pm to enjoy the view at sunset. We did. We went today at 4:30 pm. I now understand that the hostess was speaking in code. At 4:30 pm, you can dress more casually and everyone was around our age... Middle aged. And the sunset was glorious. I took many photos. It is the most sensuous decor imaginable. I enjoyed a glass of scotch and we shared a cheese plate with real honeycomb and oysters. Such a relaxing way to end the day. Oh, and there are even two fire pits inside. It's my favorite bar in Manhattan!!!The staff is lovely. And it's easy to get everywhere.. Chelsea market, cab to Broadway theater is only $10, and a quick walk to SoHo.We had breakfast at The Standard Grill which you can get to without walking outside . Excellent: poached eggs, sautéed spinach, berries and latte. With tip..$45. Ouch.We would definitely come back!","Mill Valley, California",53,5.0

Location is superb, so much better to be in the Meatpacking District than uptown, cool bars, restaurants, fab shopping and shock horror for the USA you can actually walk to them all! The High Line is a fantastic way to view the city. The roof bar is superb, the price of the drinks is well worth the view and The Standard Grill is a culinary experience not to be missed. Addionally the staff are really friendly which isn't always the case in NYC. The bathrobes are seriously luxurious. But the rooms are all style and zero practicality. The bed was huge and really comfy but one of you has to sleep in the corner next to the bathtub which means the only way in and out is through the bottom of the bed or leg-over your partner. Only one bedside shelf (yet alone a table) so if you get the inside there isn't room for a glass of water. There is NO storage, a rail with six hangers, not a drawer to be had. I absolutely hate to live out of a suitcase in a hotel, I like to unpack but no other option. The only place for said suitcase is on the floor under the coffee table. The hairdryer is pathetic, for this room rate I expect a pro salon dryer. Maybe they think all their guests turn up with a stylist?! The glass bathroom wall does mean that if you forget the privacy curtain the construction workers across the road get a free show. The mini bar takes up so much room in the corridor it's single file only between the bed and bathroom. I will drink and dine here every time I am in NCY but won't be staying again.

It's a great place to party thats for sure, with Le Bain night club, Boom Boom Room on the top of the Standard and a multitude of other funky clubs in the area all in walking distance. About a 2 block walk to the Subway and a block to Chelsea markets. West Village right next door, there's so much going on. If your staying in NYC stay in Meatpacking it is the absolute best area to stay in, forget staying in Times Square and anywhere in Mid Town its all a tourist trap. New Yorkers hate those areas, I went to Times Square once and didn't want to go back. I would not have enjoyed my time if I stayed there and a lot of friends who have stayed in those areas have come away from NYC not having the great experience I did. The hotel itself is pretty good, good service, cool entrance, all rooms have amazing views, we looked out over the Hudson. Service was great & the bed area of the hotel room was great but I didn't like the bathroom, it was weird. Its basically a shower/bath near the entrance door of the room with no curtain or door for privacy. When you wanted to get out of the shower to dry yourself you have to sort of get out onto the carpet in the room or step across the entrance door into a sort of powder room. Wasn't great from a female point of view. The corridors also had ugly carpet and were freezing. These were really the only negatives for me.

What's good? 1) The views are fantastic, from both the rooms and the bar 'The Top of the Standard'. 2) The rooms are modern and attractive, albeit a little on the small side. Coming from London that's never a surprise for me, but if you like a roomy room, this isn't it, even when booking a deluxe room or a suite. 3) the bar, the 'Top of the Standard' has fantastic 360 views. It's a beautifully decorated space, it feels like walking into a glitzy Great Gasby party. We enjoyed live jazz almost every night we went there. Watch out though, drinks are pricey but worth it. 4) The location is great! very close to the high line, chelsea market and lots of restaurants. I don't like staying in the hustle bustle around 5th Ave, so found this area refreshing. What's not so good? A) The atmosphere. It's a weird mix of artsy pretensious and student dorm room. We were kept awake on night 1 by a loud group of revellers going into and out of their rooms/the hotel between 1am - 5am. B) The service. When we complained about the noise, the hotel's response was to move us to a room on the 17th floor. Great views, granted, but right beneath the hotel's nightclub. If you want a good nights rest, decline floor 17 (under nightclub) and floor 16 (under the 24h gym). Eventually, after a third night of no sleep, we were upgraded to a Hudson Suite. These rooms are gorgeous, still a little petite in the bedroom space, but MASSIVE bathroom (remember to shut the curtains to the 180 degree panoramic windows) and phenomenal views.","London, United Kingdom",21,3.0

Had a couple of very minor problems with AC and TV but maintenance staff arrived within 5 minutes of our calling. The views from the floor to ceiling windows were truly amazing.

The restaurant is pricey, bar usually packed- but the drinks and food are top notch. In the morning the hot water was apparently depleted by the 8am surge of guests. Waited, but finally had to take cold shower.

We live in NYC, but decided to have a staycation at The Standard, as our friends were coming from out of town, and I had made arrangements for them to room there. As I pulled up in my taxi from a long Saturday at the office, I instantly felt transported and ready for an exciting evening. The reception had a Swiss Chalet vibe- warm and inviting lounge area at the entrance- mix of well dressed travelers, and NY locals, drinks flowing, and a great atmosphere. When I arrived to our room, my husband told me that he had taken our 11 yr old daughter skating at the Ice Rink in front of the hotel, and continued to tell me how nicely he had been treated by Paul Kashman, a Standard Exec., who had helped to arrange our weekend. Paul had our room prepared slightly earlier than expected as he saw our daughter had overexerted herself while skating, needing some R&R, and something warm to drink. A bowl of chicken soup arrived for our daughter instantly, and my husband was able to check in and enjoy the rest of the afternoon. When our friends arrived in the evening- we proceeded to a lovely dinner at The Standard Grill, and after party at Top of The Standard. The evening fantastically executed - no stone left unturned. The view and decor at Top of The Standard is truly spectacular, one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC. (A must see even for a New Yorker) The next morning, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise above the Hudson River- from our room's floor to ceiling windows, and amazingly comfortable bed. Great Party- Fun Staycation- Perfect Weekend!! I would definately book a weekend just like this one at The Standard again.

Does the toilet room really need a floor to ceiling glass wall? The shower is completely see through and sits almost in the center of the room, as does the bath tub. Seriously? Why?

This review, though, may be a little tainted by my disappointment in the High Line which I found too antiseptic and too hemmed in by new construction and gentrification.I had a comfortable stay and nice bright room, but to me, the hotel is over-priced. I doubt many of its rooms actually end up going for the published list price, but I ended up paying in the 300s using Hotel Tonight and it wasn't worth that much to me given other choices I know I could have made. (A note: the offers on Hotel Tonight for the High Line varied, sometimes going down to the lower 200s -- I would have judged that price worth it).I don't know if my room was typical (825) but if it was, people with major disabilities or very large people (like 6'2"") should be forewarned: the layout of the room includes a large combo tub/shower that is glassed in on the bed side and has an open side where you enter that is about 3 ft high and you have to step over it. I also don't think some one over 6 ft could get his/her head under the shower head. The toilet itself is a closet toilet, very narrow. I didn't find the neighborhood (the old meatpacking district) very interesting and the location is not a great jumping off point for going to explore elsewhere.

The staff were all friendly and solicitous. The concierge went as far as to call over to the Standard Grill as I was checking in so they'd have a dinner table ready for me (and the meal was dandy). The common areas are cool. And I loved that the walls in my 15th floor room were mostly glass; the views were tremendous.But a hotel room is a place to sleep in, at the end of the day (rimshot). And the music throbbing through my room until 4 am made that impossible for me. Maybe Le Bain had a particularly loud DJ the night I stayed there, or maybe my room has some bizarre acoustic coupling to the sound system up on 18th floor where the club is. I find it hard to believe that guests from at least the 15th floor up are expected to like being shook all night long by the base lines from one hit after another (which, as I learned, have just enough variety to be constantly annoying instead of eventually soothing to a wannabe sleeper), but maybe that's part of this hotel's brand.If so, I wish they'd have told me so I could have stayed somewhere else.","Cambridge, Massachusetts",17,2.0

Some aspects were great, others were just not at all. I don't like giving bad reviews (if you look at my reviews, you'll see most of them are 4 or 5 stars) so I'm struggling here. For a young couple or a group of 30 somethings, this hotel would probably be a 5 star experience. For us, very spoiled not-so-young people it didn't make it.Location: I'm going to start with the best part. Location is tops. We usually stay in Tribeca or Soho, this was our first venture into the meatpacking district. It was pretty great. A fun, hip neighborhood that also manages to be quaint in a strange way. 5 starsThe Room/The common areas: We had a Hudson Suite, with views on three sides. The views were terrific. The bed was very comfortable and the little seating area was cool. Those are the good parts. Now the bad. I don't consider something that is all one room to be a suite. I book suites because my husband is an early riser and I'm not, I like for him to have a place to go so I can keep sleeping once he's up. This is NOT a suite, it's one biggish room. Speaking of which...those pictures with the sexy bathtub, glassed in shower? Those are pictures OF THE ROOM. There is no separate bathroom. Mercifully the toilet is enclosed but everything else is just out there. I wanted to have my sister over for drinks but it just felt like we would be hanging out in the bathroom with our toiletries and used towels all over the place. Also, I'm not a prude but I like to shower privately and also like there to be doors or walls on all sides of the shower. In addition to being in full view, the glassed in shower is open on one side, which made me chilly while i was showering. We did request a shower curtain to provide some privacy on the three glassed in sides and this was provided. The bathroom being in the room made the room even less of a suite. Our first night in the room, Friday, we were up until 4 am, hearing and feeling the bass of house music/EDM. As we were on the 6th floor and the club is on the 18th, we couldn't figure out what we were hearing/feeling. In the morning, we told the hotel we would have to leave if there wasn't a quieter room. They also seemed puzzled as to where the noise was coming from but thought it might have the bar next door (brass monkey). They moved us to the 13th floor, which was better but did not eliminate the problem. We solved it ourselves by getting intoxicated enough to pass out. To make up for the bad night we had on Friday, the hotel gave us a $100 food and beverage credit, which was nice of them to do. As for common areas, the lobby isn't much of anything but I don't fault them for that, space is at a premium. If you are someone who likes to hang in the lobby, this isn't the place for you. My husband used the gym and said it was fine. We never went to the club (Le Bain) or the rooftop. Food: We got room service once (it was delivered promptly) and though it was simple (soup and omlette), it was very good. We also ate at the Standard Grill (using our FB credit) for brunch. It's a cool venue and the food was very good, as was the service.Service: Service here ran the gamut from great to indifferent. Kyle, who helped us solve our room problem with a credit and a move was great. Room service was great. Engineering (had to come to the room to deliver a curtain for the shower and to fix the tv) was great. Valet service was good. Bell service was okay. Front desk service was indifferent at times, pretty good at other times. Here is an example: I called at 9:30 am on Saturday to discuss the horrible night we had the previous night. Kyle arranged a new room, gave us the $100 credit and told us to pack our stuff and if we were out of the room they would just move everything for us. We left the room at 10. We got back at 2:45, went to the front desk to figure out whether we should be going to our old room or our new one and discovered nothing had been done, in fact the front desk didn't seem to know what we were talking about. Then the woman at the desk said she saw the notes and that our room would be ready ""in a few minutes"" and they would call us in our old room to let us know. One hour later, no one had called. I called guest services and ended speaking to kyle again. He said someone would be right up to help us move. 20 minutes later someone showed up. That kind of typifies the experience we had. Similarly, when we checked in, our bags took about 25 minutes to get to the room. BUT I will say this, I think a BIG part of the problem with the bag delivery and the bellman getting to our room to help us move was simply the horrible elevators. We waited 10 minutes for an elevator to move us to the new room. that might not sound like a lot but seriously, ten minutes waiting for an elevator is nuts. Checking out took 20 minutes. There was a short line but for most of the time, only one guy at the front desk. When I finally got up there, the FB credit was not on the bill. I had a feeling it wouldn't be which is why i waited in line instead of doing an express check out. It all got solved but it was very aggravating. A 338 room hotel needs more than one or even two people at the desk during peak times. As far as the issues with the bellmen, I think that was elevator driven more than staff driven. Value: At $867 a night, I wasn't thrilled. The hotel was really full though so they must be doing something right. Oh, there is free wifi which I do appreciate, especially since we, like most people, have multiple devices. I'm tired of being nickled and dimed with wifi charges.",Washington DC,68,3.0

As we've visited New York previously I had never stayed ""West"" before, and I have to say there's no other neighbourhood for me, but let's start with the hotel.The hotel is tucked away in Meatpacking under the gorgeous HighLine, with a discreet Yellow entrance the hotel oozes style from the moment you walk in. Fabulous staff greet and meet their guests, check in is swift and your bags are (as you'd expect) are casually taken to your room. We stayed on the 12th Floor with a Hudson View room. The rooms are again, super cool - not the largest but pretty standard sized when compared to other NY rooms I've stayed in. What is different is the quality of the furnishings, the uber cool bathrooms and beds (bar far the most comfortable I've slept on!). Then there's the mini bar - i honestly have never seen such a well stocked fridge and snack bar! Nice work. Apart from the location, the super cool staff, the amazing view, the fabulous roof bar ,""those cool lifts"" that had the world media going crazy this year, our most impressive element of this trip was the Concierge. Elijah was tremendous. As we wanted a different NY experience we asked him for recommendations for things to do and he didn't disappoint. Musical Comedy, Restaurants, Hot theatre tickets - he never disappointed us. Def stay at this hotel if we want to enjoy a casual but cool experience, fab restaurant too. I was mesmerised by the cool flooring made from thousands of pennies. The West Village is a lovely area to stay whilst you're staying in NY, great places to eat and party.

The High Line park is a big reason for that. The former elevated train structure has been converted into a 1.5 mile linear park connecting several west Manhattan landmarks, and spurring new development along the way. Within a short walk of The Standard, you'll find stylish shops (All Saints, Scoop, etc), cool restaurants (Catch, The Standard Grill), and soon, a cultural anchor (Whitney Museum of American Art) expected to bring millions of annual visitors to the area. We loved the energy of the area and it's only getting better.The Standard itself is one of Andre Balazs' intelligently conceived contemporary concepts that blends flat out high design with a dose of cheeky flippancy that - assuming it hits you right - is sleek blended with a youthful sense of humor. If you're in the mood for fun, The Standard has it all - rooftop bar, exclusive nightclub, Biergarten, sexy crowd, on and on. If you're in the mood for pampering, this is NOT a good choice.The good news is that this property was design built as opposed to being renovated from some other use. That means that the spaces work, generally speaking. That being said, it IS NEW York so rooms are tight. Fair Warning: though the beds are quite sleep worthy, this is NOT a plush room. The beds are low to the floor and furnishings are quite minimalist. The standard king will get you a bench, small table and a chair so short it might match the scale of your young child's playroom. There are no drawers, the emphasis being on the highly useful MINIBAR, which offers bottles of booze and other accessories in keeping with your overall goal at The Standard - carrying on the party at all times!The SHOWER. You'll either love it or hate it. See through from nearly every vantage point in a room not much larger than a London phone booth, it's designer simply says to you, ""sex."" I say, ""why not?"" but you might say, ""really?"" At the end of the day, it's all in good fun.The service level was really excellent. At all points, we were impressed with the training level and consistency of staff in friendliness and timeliness from the valet to the concierge to the cocktail waitresses in the nightclub we started calling the ""Boom Boom Room"" (Le Bain). Quintessential New York, the Boom Boom Room was one of the highlights of this property for us. Stunning build out, panoramic views of the City and the river, live music, sublime martinis...it's close to perfect.

High speed internet is a joke here, so don't bother paying anything extra for internet (we called to the tech support and they were unable to improve anything). Beds are very average in terms of comfort.Worse, is the situation with the elevators. You have to always swipe your card, and if you don't do it in time, your in for a long ride in the elevator. The card readers are terrible, and the hotel key cards are constantly becoming demagnetized (in 3 days we had to get 2 new sets of keys issued). We also saved multiple people in the elevator who were taking trips up and down due to failed keys. Fails on the basics: In the rain, no doormen to help you with your bags out of a taxi, or even out of the lobby (was not even offered by the staff).Noise: this is a party hotel and that's ok. However I don't expect the pipes and walls to hum anytime I or someone nearby takes a shower. Water pressure is so high its having some affect upon the pipes.Lastly- don't expect any preference when trying to book a table at the restaurants. Just because you are a hotel guest doesn't entitle you to any preference vs the normal public.The positives: Location, and the front desk and concierge are helpful and friendly. Clearly the hotel management doesn't care to actually manage the property. They are banking on their location and the name. There isn't actually that much style at this hotel. If you are going to spend this kind of money, stay at the Nomad, Conrad, Andaz or even dare I say a W. They all execute the basics well, and actually provide you with some service.","London, United Kingdom",24,2.0

Although there was a long line to check in at the front desk on Saturday around 6pm, I was immediately greeted by the concierge who informed me that one of the front desk agents would be with me shortly. He went on to introduce himself and I regret to say I forgot his name, tall younger gentleman with dark hair. He let me know if there was anything he could do for me he would be happy to assist and that is when I asked him for a reservation at the Standard Grill that evening I was unable to make beforehand. He informed me that the only availability that night for 2 was at 10:30. I inquired about the chef's counter and he went ahead and called the restaurant and made a reservation for me and my guest at 9pm. I was truly pleased with his assistance, he was pleasant and accommodating, thank you! Check in was very easy, efficient and quick, no complaints. My room was facing the empire state building, absolutely gorgeous view to wake up too. I called the front desk to inform them about a small stain I saw on the bed cover and she was apologetic and informed me she would send someone to replace the linen. I was out of my room at 9pm and when I returned later that evening, my linen was completely replaced, bed was remade and new towels were placed in the room. Extremely efficient room service. I dined at the Standard Grill and was a few minutes late for my reservation. I checked in at the host stand and they informed me they were working on a table for me. Although my guest and I would have preferred the chef's counter anyway, they were very accommodating in providing us with a table in the dining room. The hostess, tall, blonde hair with bangs was very sweet. Service at the grill was fantastic, no complaints. Food was equally delicious, drinks were made to perfection, my guest and I had fantastic dining experience. We then went upstairs to the Top of The Standard, formally known as the ""Boom Boom Room"" and had a few drinks. Great music, great people watching and fantastic service by the bartenders. I cannot express enough how impressed I was with the service and hospitality starting from the front desk, to the service at the Grill and Bar upstairs. Everyone was so accommodating and helpful with all of my requests. I cannot wait to return to the Standard in the future. This place has everything you want in a NYC hotel so if you are looking for somewhere to enjoy NYC nightlife, the Standard is the hotel for you.

At check in I asked if my room had a bath, I was told yes, it didn't. I had booked a liberty corner room which ended up on a low floor and the view was awful, I said I was not happy and was moved, the only thing available was a smaller room on a higher floor for one night followed by an empire corner (totally different view, but nice none the less) we were given some champagne for our inconvienince, which was nice, but I would rather have not felt I was not getting what I ordered. The liberty corner room on a low floor (we got 7th) is not a nice view at all. When we checked in we were told entrance to the nightlife was up to the door staff and no offer of being able to make a reservation was made, yet when we went to the top of the standard there were reservations for all the tables and we had wait for a cancellation to get one. We called the conceirge to get a table at the standard grill and were told they were fully booked, so we looked on top table and got a table at the fully booked restaurant no problems... We checked out a week ago and there is still a block on my credit card for over £2000 even though the full bill has been settled from that card, I have emailed them to clarify this but they have not responded.Apart from me saying what I was annoyed about, there were some positives, the guys who helped us with our bags was brilliant, very helpful and friendly, top man! The room we got from our second night was lovely, I really liked it, great view, lovely bed, it was of the quality I expected when booking such a venue. When we actually ate at the standard grill the food was fantasic, so was the service, I would recommend eating there.Basically they have a great venue, some rooms will be over priced due to building work happening since they opened, which they need to address, the different elements need to be a little more joined up, and they certainly should be focusing on making sure their guests get to use the facilities of their hotel with as little effort as possible. Everyone I spoke to seemed to want to help, it just somehow didn't work as well as it should, based on that I will probably stay somewhere else when I next visit New York, curiosity may take me back in a few years to see if they have got things together...",,21,3.0

My boyfriend had made our reservation through the phone with Paul. He was extremely professional and was able to accommodate all of our needs. His recommendations for sight seeing and dinner was so helpful and enjoyable. Upon pulling up to the Standard High Line, we were immediately greeted by the friendly valet staff. The helped us with our luggage and escorted us to the main lobby to check in. At check in, the front desk staff couldn't of been more accommodating. Yes, we arrived early(pre-check in time)which we were aware but the staff did put a rush on the room to be ready sooner. This was fine with us because it gave us plenty of time to explore the sights of the meat packing district as planned. After we walked the High Line and stopped in the Biergarten for a beer and a pretzel, we went back to the hotel. We received our room keys and took the one of a kind elevator ride up to the 10th floor. When we entered the room, I didn't know where to look first. Our room was absolutely breath taking. We had a king size bed with ceiling to floor windows around the whole room giving us panoramic views of the whole city. A flat screen TV and ipod docking station as well(but who would want to watch TV, with the most magnificent city views outside your window). There was also a sitting area with a couch and table along with a bottle of champagne waiting for us. The bathroom had a spa like shower along with a free standing tub. The cleanliness of the room was impeccable(I am a germ freak). After a long and late night out, we returned to the hotel feeling safe and extremely tired. Needless to say we, passed out in the most comfortable bed only to wake up to a beautiful sunrise outside our window. It may have been short getaway but I didn't want it to end!!

Also, I wasn't upgraded but one of my coworkers was. Maybe they only do it on your first few stays? Maybe I wasn't dressed up enough after a day in Central Park? Maybe I came in at an odd hour?

The drama of the elevator journey to your room sets the scene which is carried through to all of the public spaces.

My only complaints are 1) their Wi-Fi is so so slow. You can upgrade to a faster service for about $20 a day but I feel one shouldn't have to do that with the price you're already paying. A decent Wi-Fi service should be expected. 2) the lifts - it could take ages waiting for one, not a great inconvenience granted but could be annoying... 3) the non-access to the club for residents.

We were not disappointed - from check in the staff were very helpful and we were pleasantly sized with the size of the room. We upgraded to a queen size with a river view and it was well worth the extra money with stunning views. The rooms were kitted out with all mod cons and after reading some reviews about a lack of wardrobe space we found it no problem as all. The rooftop bar had amazing views and was a great location for a drink at sunset. We ate at the grill the hotel restaurant and it was one of the best meals we had during our stay in NYC. We stayed at the end of NY fashion week so the hotel was very busy and it really felt like it was eth hub of the Meat Packing District and a real destination place to visit. Th eonly negative was we tried to get into the hotel nightclub on the Saturday night to be turned away as it was members only even though we were residents. I have read reviews like this before and maybe they should give preference to people paying a premium and staying at the hotel.,"Swindon, United Kingdom",10,5.0

For years, I have sought hotels that have water and sunset views. I have been coming to NYC for decades, staying all over Manhattan in world class hotels.I literally could not believe my eyes when I walked into my room at the Standard High Line. I am amazed that such a room exists in NYC. I thought I was dreaming! The sunset view from my room is the best I have ever seen and that is saying something! As a film maker and photographer, I consider myself a bit of a sunset expert.The restaurants are spectacular, even the room service menu is exquisite. The Meat Packing District has really changed. There are the toniest of shops right out the door on 14th St. The Standard is a vacation in and of its own self! You don't have to leave a 2 block range to have the best of anything that you could possibly want! It is great for fun and for the business traveler too. The rooms have corner sofas wrapped around an adjustable height table that is great for meals,dropped to coffee table for entertaining and even makes a unbeatable travel office!And the Staff!! From my first contact through creative solutions to an Internet issue, this staff has really rocked my world. I would go so far as to say that the service here is the best that i have ever had. Shout Outs go to Paul, Tim,Christina, Caitlin, Phil, Emory, Milton, JP and to the restaurant and cleaning staff. You know what you did for me!Kudos to all.

We were there for two nights. As is typical in NYC hotels, the price seems high for the room size and quality. This is one of the hippest neighborhoods in Manhattan now, so you're paying for that. That said, the floor to ceiling windows in the city view room were amazing. Not noisy...we were on the 8th floor. If you aren't intimate with your travel buddy - watch out for which room type you get. There is a private toilet, but not a private shower/bath. There is a glass panel separating the bed and the shower. If you are at all handicapped - warning - the bed is basically a mattress on the floor. It is very low to the ground. We had a problem with our toilet while there but the repair man appeared almost instantly to fix it and it gave us no trouble after that. We had a drink at the lounge upstairs and despite rumors of them being incredibly rude, were incredibly accommodating. Best cocktail I've ever had actually. This is the best place in the hotel for views. Go at sundown. Do check out the private bathrooms too. Tres elegante. The beer garden on the street level gets really crowded (especially if there's a game on) and is also pretty pricey, but it's fun. The service in general everywhere in the hotel was top notch.

Check in was smooth. Receptionist knew I am light sleeper and discussed the 2 options with me. I settled for the 9th floor river view to be away from the noisy top bar. There was busy road underneath but the noise was bearable, not too disturbing. Apparently I was upgraded but the room was really small. The bathroom did not have a door and there was glass wall between the bed and the tiny half size bath tub. You could be showering and looking at NY skyline. It is OK when you are by yourself, I suppose. Amenities are very basic: no shower cup or slippers, I had to request the latter. Bathrobes are very heavy and not from towel like material. I know they were fresh but somehow did not feel like it so I did not use them. I had 4 towels each size provided each day and linens were changed daily as requested (and tipped) which I appreciated. The room was very clean at all times. There is no proper wardrobe due to lack of space, just rail with curtain and five hangers. It was challenging as I was there for a week. The views from the large windows are not obstructed and really amazing, I would say even therapeutic. I could watch the sunset. The air con blew only cold air so I was advised to switch it off for the room to warm up. There is always plenty of people around the hotel due to night club, restaurant and roof terrace on premises. I have used last two and it was nice but most of the days there was no table available although I was a guest. I tried room service once and it was prompt at midnight but burger was average. My flight was late and the lady at the reception very kindly extended my check out until 3 pm, something that never happens in the chain hotel. My company books a lot with them and it is nice to see we are treated well. Actual check out was busy and there was nobody to help me with my bags to the car but I understood the situation. I would stay there again as I felt safe in the good area and staff was kind and flexible for which I am thankful.","London, United Kingdom",103,4.0

I arrived mid afternoon to The Standard with 3 bags for a 5 day stay and there was no one to one to acknowledge me & I had to wait 15 minutes to check in - then was pointed to the lift. When I asked if someone could bring my bags to the room, I was told to leave them and someone would bring them up. The staff that served me, was most unhelpful and certainly unfriendly - not the welcome I was expecting.I got to me room & then had make 2 phone calls to chase me bags and waited 45 minutes for them to arrive as 'they couldn't be located'. When I expressed my frustration to the staff member, his words were 'no one really cares, no point complaining, really busy, understaffed, should write a report on trip adviser'.... this pretty much sums up the attitude over the next 5 days.At no point when I went through the foyer was I ever acknowledged by anyone - I felt no one really bothered if I was there for the nightclub or paying over $600 a night for a room. I came and went from the hotel several times and other than first thing in the morning, I often had to wait for 3 lifts to come to get to me room (as was so busy), I could not get into the nightclub on 2 occasions even though I was staying in the hotel, at The Grill, even though there were only a few tables and plenty of staff, I had to ask 4 times if I could order breakfast (wait for 'right' waiter to serve me). My departure was even a worst experience as we packed our bags and vacated our room at 8am to have out bags brought down when housekeeping was ready. We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and it took 40 minutes to locate our bags - when they finally brought our bags , 1 was missing and the staff could not have been more unhelpful or unfazed if they tried. We were risking missing our flight - when I asked to speak to the manager, I was told 'Paul on duty but not around and the M.D was called Kevin & I could complain to him'. When staff behind the counter could see that I was getting concerned & my husband had gone with security to find our missing bag, not one person made an effort to assist. The arrival & departure when travelling leave the biggest impact. The room was noisy, pretty modest relative to the price and the air conditioning was so high in the hotel, we were desperate to be outside. This all could be overcome - what left a lasting impression was the incredible lack of 'hospitality' and 'service' and the staff culture within the hotel of arrogance. This, I believe to stem from leadership - or lack of. Fortunately I loved everything else about my trip to N.Y and will return again and again, will just be more selective about where I stay.","London, England, United Kingdom",10,1.0

First of all not everybody is allowed to take his camera to the rooftop bar, and till today i didn't understand the selection criterias. Anyway it's a quite strange idea to close the rooftop bar during a few days in summer to do some renovation works ( during our stay of 7 nights we only could use the rooftop bar on our 6 th night). And last but not least the attitude of some staff members of the rooftop bar is absolutly not professional, they treat you like underlings and ask you to free your table for another groupe because those will probably drink more than you and your party does!!! They don't care that you are an hotel guest. These staff members seem to forget that it is not because they are working at a 5 star hotel that they can treat guests of these hotels in an arrogant way. It's quite impressive to notice that nowadays in such hotels, you can still find these attitudes among staff members. I complained about this fact at the rooftopbar's supervisor, and this guy tried at least to apologize by offering to refund our drinks. Good point for him and his professional attitude.

I'm writing my review now while I'm still here, so I never have to think about this awful place again.Firstly, the physical complaints. The room is too small. The bed is low to the floor, feeling like a futon (apparently all of the rooms are the same). The bathroom has no privacy (with only timber shutters between the bed and the bathroom) which allows all light and noise from the bathroom to be seen and heard at the bed. This is absolutely unworkable for a couple travelling together experiencing jetlag who might need to use the bathroom at different times. Basically, the rooms do NOT look at all like the hotel photographs and are wearing very poorly despite their relatively recent age.On of the pillow cases had approx ten separate holes in it. One of our towels was torn. One of our towels had fluorescent yellow stains all over it. We requested a couple of extra pillows - they were delivered to us without pillow cases! Our hall light flicked on and off all week - no one came to fix it. It's just rubbish.But you know what, the complaints about the physical aspects of the hotel really are nothing compared to the environment the hotel creates for its guests, and the treatment by the staff. When events are held at the rooftop venues, they reserve two of the four lifts for the functions - leaving over 300 rooms to share two lifts. Usually I had to wait more than five minutes to get a lift.On two separate occasions during our week we went to parts of the hotel where people had just vomited - in public areas, during the day.The hotel supplies you with earplugs because all of the venues are noisy at night. Right now, I can hear a bar full of people singing along to 'Killing me Softly' and 'No Diggity'. Lol.This property is essentially a bar complex, with rooms. The room guests are a very low priority and treated very poorly. The staff apologise but do nothing and I think they suffer a lot of complaints. They never answered 'yes' to any request. I could not compliment a single staff member from the week, except for a breakfast waitress who was lovely.The location suited us very well but there is no way I would ever stay in this place again. You know what, this hotel failed in so many ways I can't be bothered typing any more about it. I can't think of anyone I know who would accept this type of treatment at a hotel.Oh one last thing. Usually, when the hotel receives a bad review, they suggest the reviewer contact Julie in their Executive Office to help them next time they come to stay. Please don't suggest that to me, it is an absolute insult. Your staff did not do a single thing to help me enjoy my stay while I was here and I'm not coming again.","Brisbane, Australia",12,1.0

May I ask you a question? yes she said.How was I supposed to know that my car was on the other side of the building and if you had the key and we are standind in front of you waithing for the car why would someone not tell us its here [her answer] ""They probaly didnt know who you were"" well how do they know who anyone is.

I'm not sure what was deluxe about the room I was upgraded to, but according to the web site, the superior room I booked was larger, so I may have been better off staying with that.The good:- Great views. I was looking south/southwest over the highline, and out towards the river.- Pleasant service. Everyone from the bell staff to the front desk staff were very friendly, and everything was ""can do.""The bad:- I spend a lot of time in New York. I have a pretty good feeling as to the typical room sizes in the city, and the room I had was small. Very small.- The bathroom is interesting, with the entire room tiled and with a rim separating it from the hallway. This proved to be necessary, because the rain shower is only separated from the rest of the bathroom by a narrow glass wall that shelters the sink from it, but the water level begins to rise as you use the shower. The entire area in front of the sink was soaked to the point that I had to lay down some dry towels to have someplace to stand as I finished getting ready.- No ""real"" ironing board, a strange little half board.Caveat emptor on parking: they advertise a $55/day rate on their web site. If you are parked a minute over 24 hours, an additional $55 will apply. Additionally, there's a $20/day SUV upcharge that wasn't indicated on their web site or at check-in that I was surprised with. I received an emailed folio after departing with $150 in parking when I was expecting $55.The location on the High Line is great, and the lobby and surrounding areas are certainly trendy, but I think for the price, I'll try another property on my next visit.","San Francisco, California",7,2.0

I am used to city noises, living in the middle of Stockholm, but this was like having a party in the room. We were a team who travelled in business and had to work the day after. Not acceptable in this price segment. The management could not do anything about the room fee since we booked through a booking agency, but could make a free dinner.

The Steak House have great food, and the beer cellar on Saturdays are great fun.It's the rooms who bother me most. I did stay in a suite for a week in May, And first of all, there wasn't any place to store your clothes. No cupboard. Just a coat-hanging rack with 6 hangers... for a couple staying for one week...The shower room and the bathroom was split on each side of the corridor, which wasn't really practical, and the threshold was so low,so if you moved to much around in the shower, the water would flow onto the carpet in the corridor.There was no electric plug close to any mirror. The only plug available was down on the floor next to the door, so you had to bow down on your knees to blow dry your hair.

It looked like a definite winner of a room.Unfortunately, the day we checked in there was plumbing issue that took out two studios. We wound up taking a downgraded room upon the recommendation of Paul the Director of the Front Office. First impression, the room was a good size and had a spectacular view of the lower Manhattan, the World Trade Center, and the Hudson River. As New York City is my hometown, it was especially nice to see it from this angle. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover there was a large and deep bath for two and adjacent rain shower in the corner of the room.

From the moment I stepped out of my cab I was greeted on the street by an attendant who took my bags. Staff were (mostly) polite and discreet and check in was fairly smooth. I found aspects of the hotel nauseatingly trendy for my liking and the clientele who frequented the bars upstairs made me want to hide out in my room and order room service. I went to the top floor for a drink and was greeted by - no exaggeration - an 8' tall Amazonian hostess in a gold dress. A little disconcerting but I guess that's the point. The bar was golden everything, the light, ambiance and the views were stunning. Good service and I know I was paying for an experience but 1 miniature hamburger, a cube of tuna and two cocktails later and an $80 bill - seriously?!The room itself was small. I have experienced this in every hotel in NYC I have stayed at but thought that, at $500 a night, at least spatially, things would be marginally more generous. Inside, the credenza was scratched and chipped which seemed tacky. The bathroom had an awkward layout - the shower was completely open which left big puddles everywhere. The proximity of the toilet to the bed did not make for a romantic experience. The tub was deliciously large and deep and they included some nice quality bubble bath. Also, no garbage bin in the bathroom which was odd. We could hear quite a bit of surrounding noise, yelling from the bar, neighbors etc - though not so bad as to prevent sleeping. The bed was very comfortable though a tight squeeze next to the wall. Lovely wood panelling in the room. In the morning, due to a lack of available resources to make coffee in the room I ordered a bagel, coffee and juice - $38 bill. Again, seriously?! Enjoyed the room and the floor to ceiling views all morning only to discover - after walking around topless - to my great amusement, a construction worker watching me from a nearby skyscraper - with binoculars!! Note: keep the sheer curtains drawn!The pitch black elevator with video spiralling through space was not so novel the next morning and it took forever to get my luggage from storage later in the day but overall, fairly seamless and pleasant. The lobby is small for the size of the hotel and the aesthetic feels a bit ten years ago, design wise.Overall, I would say - not particularly great value but if you have money to burn, go for it.

Reception were very apologetic and explained they were unable to move us that day but would move us the following day whilst we were out.

The hotel is ridiculously noisy, which makes sleep difficult/impossible, even when using the complementary ear buds/plugs. The hotel does have lots of plus points, not least a roof top bar that offers amazing views of the city. Although we were a little disappointed with how far the 'informal' dress code extends. Maybe just us, but we weren't expecting shorts and trainers. To put that in context, the alternative roof top bar is very very formal, and I guess we expected a better balance. Overall, the noise aside we liked the hotel. The location is simply fantastic and we very much enjoyed the food in the hotels grill/restaurant. The price was comparative to most city hotels we've stayed in. I’d very much recommend the hotel for those wanting to party for the weekend, but for any longer or if sleep is a requirement, think twice.

The bar staff at the Top of the Standard were not that attentive, but I guess that's to be expected at a pretentious bar (and we were there before it gets crowded).

Our room was probably more privileged than some others as we had reserved a corner-room at a slightly higher rate. It was well designed with floor-to-ceiling windows so that we could enjoy the view to the fullest. The missing portion was, as if the room was actually designed for one-night stays! It did not offer more than 5 cloth hangers (there,practically, was no room) and no drawers to accomodate our shirts, tshirts, etc. Suitcases were a pain; there was hardly any place to accomodate them. Since we stayed 4 nights and had a longer journey in front of us, this was highly dissappointing.The dinner outside at the Standard Grill was a delight. We were served by exremely friendly and knowledgable waiters and the menu was excellent.

The views were nice, but nothing -- and I mean nothing -- justified the price. The room felt cheap. The bathroom is meant to look stylish but is poorly designed. We paid extra to have what appeared to be a lovely tub, but when I went to use it the handle literally fell off.The service at this hotel was nothing short of snobby in a place that has absolutely nothing to be snobby about. We have stayed at budget hotels and high end hotels around the world and nowhere can I recall encountering a ruder group of people. Their ""holier than thou"" attitude when asked to fix things (e.g., the broken off tub handle was met with ""I'll have someone check to see if there is an issue with your tub"") was unbelievable to me. In their view ""the management's always right"" rather than the customer. Truly, I've never, never encountered this kind of attitude anywhere.The restaurant next door was pretty darn awful as well. I would write more about that but I've pushed that particular experience out of my mind. All I really can remember was that the meal was greasy beyond belief (although the service there was pretty good).The one good thing thing about this hotel is its location alongside the High Line, which we walked once mid-day on a Saturday (very sunny and extremely crowded) and early Sunday morning (7:30 am - beautify weather, nobody there). I'd obviously recommend the Sunday morning walk.My advice, though -- save your money and stay in a nicer, cheaper place and take a cab (or walk) to the High Line early one morning to walk it. It's truly lovely -- a stark contrast to The Standard High Line, which was pretty darn awful.","Chicago, Illinois",50,2.0

There is always people on the High Line, and the bars/restaurants right downstairs are very noisy and busy all day/night. Room size: teeny-tiny. Felt like sleeping in a pod or one of those Yotel mini-rooms. Miscellaneous:- a lot of entitled and rude guests stay here, so there were lots of obnoxious people everywhere in that super small lobby and elevator bank.- elevators are basically black and have colorful swirling graphics and pictures playing on the monitors inside of them. Seizure-inducing.- staff seem pleasant enough, but a few acted like they were super cool for wearing the Standard's uniform, and like they were too cool to smile at the guests milling about.- rooms are seriously tiny. Bed is low to the ground, shower is one of those open-concept designs, so there isn't a door, and there are wooden slats that can open/close like blinds between the bathroom area and bed. - other than a sense of elitism because of the name and fame of the hotel, we couldn't see what the fuss was about or why it is such a hot spot for jerks.

It's trendy hotel with a great location: the hotel sits atop the High Line park and is minutes away from the Chelsea Market, and is close to many clubs, shops, and restaurants. It's about a 5-7 minute walk from a nearest subway stop. I got a discounted rate through jetsetter - I paid about 50% of the usual rate, which was fine by me as this hotel tends to be expensive, if not to say overpriced. Our room (Standard King) was comfortable and clean - the bed was super comfortable. Large flat screen tv on the wall across from the bed. Great views. Noise level was reasonable - we were on the 7th floor.However the bathroom was small, and the shower set up with a ""see-through"" glass wall leaves no privacy whatsoever. Another strange thing was a complete absence of drawers or shelves of any sort to store clothes. You could hang your shirts or whatever in a small space by the door, but no place whatsoever to store underwear or t-shirts, etc. For the price one pays at this hotel, I would expect better than that...Service was friendly. Internet was slow - worked best by the toilet... We didn't eat at the hotel - cannot really comment on the hotel restaurant(s). I went to the Chelsea market each morning to pick up coffee, pastries, etc.Overall, it was an interesting experience for both of us - we wanted to stay by the High Line/Chelsea Market area - but, in my view, there are better and cheaper hotels in NYC than the Standard High Line.","Toronto, Canada",147,3.0

Let me explain. My husband and I just got back from NYC; we stayed at the Standard High Line. The hotel is slick and bright, from the yellow revolving door to the music and lights in the elevator. Check-in was speedy and efficient. Even though we arrived very early, there was a room available for us.The rooms are small, yes, but well appointed. The floor to ceiling windows and airy feeling of the decor made the room look bigger than it was. The seating area was great for breakfast and everything (except the wifi) worked perfectly. Oh and the rattle in the AC on high, but it wasn't hot enough to need that. The bed was INSANELY comfortable. The peek-a-boo shower was nifty, lots of towels, and nice toiletries. The location just can't be beat - every morning my husband walked to Chelsea Market for coffee and fresh delights for breakfast. There are so many great restaurants around the area, and the High Line is such a wonderful urban park.So. Back to the drawers. There aren't any. Drawers I mean. We spent several minutes actually looking for a shelf or bank of drawers - nothing. So we hung everything up. The only other comment I can make is that the wifi only worked reliably in the toilet. We didn't try to get into the rooftop - frankly we're probably not hip enough, from comments I've read on TA. :) After walking for miles and miles each day, we didn't feel a need to use the gym; we didn't frequent any of the eateries either - maybe another time.Overall, we enjoyed the property for the location and the sleep quality, and the views.","Toronto, Canada",49,4.0

It was a great experience. Convenient location - perfect if you like running along the Hudson - and not far away from most of New York attractions. Check in was quick and efficient. The size of the room was OK; bigger than in many other NYC hotels I have staid in. The hotel atmosphere is, what should I call it; playful? Lots of stylish guests looking for fun and shopping in New York. The well known spots on the top of the hotel is worth a visit; if you are able to get in! I have been at the Boom boom boom room a few times, and it is a fun place, but nothing extra ordinary. Breakfast is very good. Expect to pay around 30 usd for a healthy and tasty start of your day. The only thing that annoyed me in this hotel is related to the elevators and entrance to the roof top. After a certain point of time in the evening, you are forced to take a real round trip to either get back to your room; not to mention get back to the roof top! I ended up in a rather hefty discussion with the doorman on the street after going for a quick stop in my room. It was close to impossible to persuade him into guiding me to the rooftop and my friends. I should be possible to create a more convenient system for hotel guests and entrance to the roof top. Apart from that; this is a hotel well worth a visit. As for the price; 1000 usd for two nights. Worth it? Hmmm, for some people yes.","Oslo, Norway",1612,4.0

I did as i always do before staying, I read trip advisors reviews. I read the worst ones and looked at the dates to see if they were current and they were, complaints ranging from A to Z. There were many more great reviews than bad, but enough bad to concern me. We had friends that had already booked there and I had previously agreed to come and stay. So changing hotel was not going to happen, I was going to have to suck it up and make the best of It.Well lets just say that I am glad I did. The Standard is in the Meatpacking District, which is crazy busy, energetic , great party , food, drink, shopping. My experience was amazing, from the minute I pulled up to park, It was a bit difficult to find front entrance to hotel because of how busy area is. But within seconds I had a couple of Valets / Bellman come over and ask me if I was looking for the Standard Hotel. From here on I have to say every single person I encountered, Valet , Bellman, Front Desk, Security, Housekeeping was extremely pleasant and always wanting to help. I booked through Hotel Tonight and got a great rate. Front desk offered a couple different floor options, 17 or 12, said the only difference would be noise. Rooftop bar is basically open all night and she said for noise purposes she would recommend the 12th floor.We took her advice, I loved the room. It was small of course, but this is new york. The room was very Clean, cozy , almost like a cruise ship room in all the good ways, the bed was low , pretty much sitting on floor, we had floor to ceiling window views of the hudson river and The Freedom Tower. Shower head was rain shower with great pressure, A huge tube that fits two easily is in room. Very large mini bar assortment . We ate breakfast at hotel restaurant which is out front of hotel entrance. (forgot name) but that was excellent. We had drinks at The Top of the Standard and brunch there on Sunday, it was AMAZING! The drinks are made to perfection and the french toast and burger bites were incredible.As I right this review I am trying to find and point out any negatives, and the only one is that being a hotel guest does not give you any leverage at all for entry to clubs, wait on line like everyone else.

I always loved the Standard (as prominently displayed in my app of the West Village). My room was on the 4th floor looking north with a nice view of the high line and the Empire State building. Just be aware that constructions has started on an empty lot across the street and that within 1 year or so, views of the Empire State Building might become obstructed. I arrived really early after a red eye and was lucky my room was ready. The staff was efficient and professional. As you probably read on previous reviews, no double beds, only king beds and no real privacy since the shower/tub is behind a glass window (though it's very sexy if you ask me). Don't worry, the toilet has plenty of privacy. A well stocked minibar, nice little seating area and lots of light. The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well. I stayed a Saturday night and the whole area around the hotel turns into a mini Las Vegas which is pretty gross but the hotel has excellent security and I did not hear any street noise from my room. Amazing drinks and views from the Top of The Standard which is the bar lounge on its top floor. Strict dress code so don't show up with flip flops and shorts. Also, being nice and polite goes a long way. Great food at the Grill or grab drinks and some pizza on the plaza (during the warm month) or ice skate in the winter. And because you are right on the High Line Park take a very early stroll when it opens. It is so much better when no one is on it. After 11AM it's very crowded.

When you pay from 400 US a night and UP i expect to get access to the hotel aminities. This was not the case here. I tried one evening to go up to take picture of the skyline, then i was stopped to go up because it was another private event, then i tried the other rooftop thru the restaurant, They have a dresscode, so i had to go downstairs again to change to formal attire and then go up to try, suddenly i got stopped again because i had camera equipment with me, i asked how to get to the roof with my camera, they said i couldnt access the roof with big lenses and huge camera equipment. I only had a mid sizes camera and after discussing with the security people that my cameras were small enough i got in only for private pictures. But this was only because i desagreed.

We wanted to do New York in our age bracket, late 20's early 30s, and I suppose this hotel is it. As others have said here, it is 'Hip', has a great location, but beyond that, it is an overpriced disappointment. The location is great, as are the views from the rooms, and the hotel is surrounded by great restaurants, bars and coffee shop/cafes, as well as having a very safe feel around the streets at most times of the day and night. The Brass Monkey around the corner was GREAT!The rooms are small but comfortable, clean, but NOT quiet… and this is where it falls down. We got the feel that as a hotel guest you come second. Second to the customers from outside, who come for the Bars and the rooftop Nightclub associated with the hotel. These seem to be the prime focus. Don't worry if you don't wish to attend the nightclub, you will still be able to listen to all the 'hip beats' being laid down upstairs while you are in your room trying to sleep at 2am! The noise travels waaaay down. If you want service, stay elsewhere, your every request seems a burden, and for the life of me I can't see what, other than the view, the attraction of these bars or the snotty nightclub upstairs is (you want in? you're a hotel guest ?, line up like everyone else pal… or just go to your room and listen, you'll be able to hear it!), the service in these is even WORSE! Ignored for 20 minutes just to order a beer in the cafe downstairs, then ignore for a further 15 while trying to pay the bill; oh but we still want to know why you didn't tip us …!!!!Coming back to your room after dinner or a night out? Try sharing a lift to your room with 20 drunken yobbo buffoons who are heading up to the rooftop club. Or even better, queue for a lift to your own hotel room because of this! (Heres an Idea, how about separate room key activated lifts for hotel guests?!)The hotel COULD be wonderful. It is funky, intriguingly decorated, comfortable… very Hip New York, and in a great location, however, Guests MUST be treated as a priority, but in The Standard Highline, they are not.We felt like we were a burden.

There are lots of great design elements that should raise this hotel above chain hotels, but it falls way short on the basics. Somehow the designers of the hotel lost sight of the idea that the rooms have to work as living spaces and the owners of the hotel have lost sight of the idea that a luxury hotel needs to be in great condition.The room was not in great condition. The adjustable height table was scratched, probably because people had dumped their suitcases there because there weren’t any other practical places to put suitcases. The otherwise comfortable king-size bed had threadbare sheets and a worn-out quilt, prompting a request for replacements. The shower head wasn’t properly attached to the wall and the toilet was reluctant to flush properly.As a living space the hotel was works badly. It starts in the lifts where it’s so dark that every guest has to grovel around in front of the button panel to find their floor. In the room, the light switches were baffling – it took thirty minutes to find them and understand how they all worked. The light in the shower room was so dim that you could barely see what you were doing – you needed to open the louvres between the shower room and living area to let just enough light in, which isn’t good if you want privacy. There wasn’t sensible closet space to store clothes – it’s a curtained off space behind the wash basin. There were no practical places to hang a towel and no place for a bathmat other than on the carpet just behind the room’s door.You also want to feel you’re welcome in a great hotel. Having to pay extra for a high-speed speed upgrade to the just-adequate Wi-Fi doesn’t say you’re welcome here. In the evening when the uber-fashionable nightclub on the rooftop takes over half of the hotel’s lifts and the hotel guests' lift lobby is reconfigured into a mirrored maze leading to an unfriendly, oversized bouncer who demands to see your room card before you can enter the lifts is even less welcoming.

Once seated the two women next to me said good luck getting any service. They hadn't seen their waiter for 20 minutes. They were ready to walk out without paying. I wait then left, no one came to my table. I went to the grill, the food is great, but the service there leaves something to be desired. Everyone is pretty, but that's as deep as it goes.

It’s a structure that invites curiosity!So this time we decided to stay here. Let me get straight to the part when you walk into your room on a beautiful late afternoon summer day, and in front of you is the famous skyline covered in a golden glow, with the Empire State building jutting out of the tetris like horizon. I was in love!What is amazing about this hotel is that every room has a view. Because it is situated on the very east of mid-town, each room either faces towards the newly topped out Freedom Tower or the Empire State building. You’re guaranteed a view.The rooms are not the largest, but they have a retro feel and are very well layed out. They’re bright, have a very large and comfortable bed, and even though I’m not a tub person, I loved the rather deep and squarish tub where two people can easily fit in.And then there is the rooftop bar on the 18th floor. Wow! 360 you are surrounded by the famous NYC skyline. It just wants to make you drink a manhattan, which you also do. Just make sure you are dressed right! No sneakers. No shorts. I actually went out and bought shoes to come here!The service is wonderful, friendly, hip and young. And as you walk out into the newly refreshed meat packing district, you feel the buzz of this great city.If you decide to workout, the gym on the 17th floor has got to have one of the best views I’ve ever seen from a gym!EXCEPT … I was inclined to take a star off my rating due to the crappy internet, which really pissed me off. Free internet should be good enough to do your emails and read news. And The Standard does not deliver on this basic premise. It jammed my laptop because all the synch-ing went awry. When I measured the speed, the download and upload was embarrassingly slow. This really needs to be fixed for as to the rest, this hotel is perfection.","Singapore, Singapore",179,5.0

We where not disappointed on that front at all. We arrived quiet late after midnight and the place was rocking. After we pushed our way through the party crowd and revolving door we made it to reception. We where met with smiles and didn't find them arrogant at all, get it's a part spot so don't get on your high horse and you will be fine.After we went downstairs for a drink and a bite. The beer was cold and the good was great. Most of all the atmosphere was jumping.We didn't come here for value for money so we didn't realty judge the place on it. Sure the clubs had a bit of attitude but they needed it because the crowd can be random in a not so great way.For a hip hotel the staff where very nice and accommodating. If you want your butt kissed constantly go to the generic 5 star chains. However I must say the attitude of the host at the main restaurant was a bit annoying, he really did go the extra mile to be arrogant. I won't mention names but Mr dreadlock you know who you are.

And it doesn't really matter whether you upgrade a bit or not. With two people in a standard room, it feels like you're living on a submarine.They just don't get the little stuff right: the snobby staff at the desk; the stupid door policy for the club; the shampoo dispenser in the shower instead of bottles; the airs the reception girls at the top floor bar and club give themselves. The whole place feels like you walked into a club that isn't really happy that you've come.$100 buys you two drinks and three plates of tapas in the upstairs bar. Usually an overpriced place is fine if the experience makes up for it. But the quality of the food is so-so and the staff takes away the rest of the joy from the view. Breakfast is good, if pricy, though you can wait a good twenty minutes for the initial coffee serving. Similarly snooty staff there, though.Finally the location isn't all that it's cracked up to be. The High Line is cool, but on the weekends New Jersey invades the meatpacking district. It's really gone downhill from a few years ago.If this place were anywhere but New York, it'd be out of business. Seriously - avoid.",London,15,1.0

The front desk staff was friendly and check-in was quick and easy. The check-in for valet for dropping off my car was also quick and easy...We booked the hudson studio room to have extra space...the room had awesome views as well.That is pretty much where the good part stops...I had called ahead and requested a room on a high floor 2-3 days prior to the trip.... the staff said that it could be accommodated on the phone.When I arrived at the hotel and checked-in they stated that my room was only on the 5th floor. I asked about the request for a higher floor and the nice front desk person stated that unfortunately they were already all committed to other guests who have checked into the hudson rooms. I was surprised as the room which I paid for should have been reserved with the high floor request in advance as booked.. Regardless not a huge deal... I went to the room and even though the room was on the 5th floor the views were amazing...Friday after checking in we went to the roof top bar area around 9pm...The staff at the door was pretty rude on the 18th floor, we had no clue where to go we stated that we were hotel guests and they said ok no problem and stamped our hands. However when we did not know what door to go through to get into the roof top area they then rudely showed us.. Like we were suppose to know to push on a wall that has large that has a door in it.. Then when we got into the bar area there was about 10 other people there at the bar and 40-60 people in the club area....The bar had (no joke ) about 12 bar tenders.However after waiting for over 15 minutes myself, my girl and the other 8-10 people at the bar were confused as to why nobody would get served by one of the 12 bar tenders!The staff at the bar was all pretty rude and anytime any of use tried to ask for drinks they were all ""busy"" setting up for the club that nightI cannot understand for $18+ a drink why one of the 12 people setting up the bar for the club couldn't process drink orders.. Seems like very poor management of time/staff.Eventually everyone got drinks ( by a rude bar tender as they were upset that we all kept asking... )We then had a good time as the night went on and were able to get drinks more regularly once the staff ""setup""The staff on the roof top part of the bar as well was very snobby and rude... I was very surprised.It seemed that they were that way with most people...Saturday around 2pm we went back to the 18th floor figured we would catch some sun and grab a view drinks. To our surprise the people at the door on the 18th floor this time very rudely said that the entrance to the bar is on the street now.Like we were suppose to know that.. I said wait, we are hotel guests and last night I walked right through the door you are standing next to to get to the roof. The lady at the desk on the 18th floor extremely rudely stated again that the area is closed and we had to go back down to the street.We were also with others guests of the hotel at this time and we were all very surprised.So myself my date and 4 other hotel guests went back to the elevator and to the street. The most surprising part of it all was that when we got to the street there was a line of about 80 people trying to get to the roof of our hotel.We went to the front of the line and asked the door man hey we are all staying in the hotel, here is our room keys the lady upstairs said we had to enter from the street.The man extremely rudely stated that we had to move away from his ""area"" at the door and that we could not get upstairs unless we waited in the long line of people.I was shocked. I told the guy look I have a room upstairs at a price of over $700 a night and you are telling me I cannot get to my own hotels roof top lounge area at 2pm on a saturday. He basically again said the same thing... that nobody could get up unless they waited in the line. I was extremely upset... I have never been to a bar or hotel where the staff overall except the front desk employees all seemed so snobby and rude. I have stayed at dozens of high end hotels in nyc and over 100 hotels in the past 10+ years in other major cities and never had experienced anything like this on such a broad level of disregard for hotel guests and customers.We ended up going to the Dream Downtown roof top bar ( I stayed here a few times before ) way better than the standard highline... in every aspect. We were not hotel guests and we were allowed to go right up to the roof top bar with a packed crowd and got several drinks easily.After the dream we walked down the block and hit up my favorite spot the Gansevoort Meat Packing District hotel. (stayed here several times before as well) Again same thing.. Got on the elevator not as a hotel guest and went right to the roof. Even the rooftop bar at the dream downtown and the gansevoort is far beyond the view of the standard. The standard rooftop is very small.Gansevoorts is huge and has a pool and a much better crowd, same with dream downtown!The Gansevoort roof was packed, and even though there were only 4 bar tenders on the roof/pool area they served us all within minutes and they were all very happy to be there making money doing their job and treating customers right. I tip normally at about 30%+ when a bar tender in a major city does a good job.. They showed much appreciation... I walked up to the bar with tons of people at it throughout the rest of the night and I was immediately served and they knew what I wanted. The highline standard can learn a lot from the neighboring hotels...We ended up staying at the gansevoort roof for like 4-5 hours just drinking like crazy and having tons of fun with the other customers drinking on the roof.../pool area...Sunday called for my car then went downstairs 30 minutes later and could not find exactly where the valet person was.There was no valet attendant where we originally parked/dropped off the car.I also could not see my car anywhere on the street... I went inside asked the guys in the lobby.. They said that the valet usually parks the cars on the other side of the bar in the lobby instead of where we dropped it off...Ok no big deal, except we finally see my car and still no valet attendant.Nobody was in sight.I waited around for 10 minutes near my car and other cars and could not find any valet person at all to get my key from.Another thing that shocked me is that they had my Jaguar f type convertible parked on the street with the roof down.There were people near my car taking pictures of it and you can easily open the glove box and the other storage areas from the car with the doors locked because the roof was down. So basically anyone could have took stuff out of my car. No valet person there to watch over it!Eventually found valet attendant when he came back from I am assuming dropping off other customers cars, we got our keys and left.Only to find out that when I got home to PA I noticed that my EZ Pass was missing from my windshield.So now I drove from NYC to PA about 2 hours through several tolls with no ezpass.Someone stole the ez pass from my car ( since it was left open with no valet watching it )I cannot wait to get the bills from NY, NJ turnpike and PA with bills for going through the EZ pass without paying...I had no clue until I got home that it was missing ( noticed when I went through the last toll in pa and the light did not turn green... )All in all we had an amazing trip... I travel frequently and I had an excellent time with my significant other in NYC. However other than enjoying the hotel room we did not really have any fun at all in the hotel which is sad because when I go away and stay in a nice hotel, I normally will just spend most of my time and money in the hotel relaxing...I ended up spending thousands of dollars in other hotels which is a loss for the standard not me... I will not be back...Rocco","Miami Beach, Florida",7,2.0

Lobby is cool, rooftop club is super cool, (Just because you stay in hotel does not mean you get into club and they tell you that when you check in) great food and bars in and right next to hotel. So look I am 34 years old and $450 a night hotels are more and more common especially in NYC. If I was staying at this hotel with my wife I would think it was cool and would have less issue with it. Unfortunately I stayed here with my female BFF for her birthday weekend. This hotel has NO ROOMS WITH DOUBLE BEDS... There are no roll aways either. No big deal we are close and we had a king room. The weird part is the shower and bath. There is a huge walk in shower with a bath tub that will fit 4 people right when you enter the room. Guess what it has no door and is open to the room. There are shutters that you can close to the room but there is no door you can close. We made it work but you would think they could install a fogged glass door or something. Also the Shampoo, Body Wash, and Conditioner is mounted to the wall and cannot be moved. (Seriously it requires a tool to refill them.) If you take a bath there is no way to use the bath products as they are on the other side of the massive shower. That was super annoying! Hotel has free Wifi which for a hotel at this price point is rare. All of the people that are in and hanging around the hotel are gorgeous young professionals. You for sure feel cool for staying here. Best part of the hotel was the bed linens.

Well, the chic and a bunch of poseurs. It does not feel very welcoming to normal, average, people - like ME! :) There is a snooty vibe all around - I take that back. THE BELL STAFF were not snooty - they were friendly and pleasant. Everyone else (staff and guests) were snooty patooty.And yet. And yet.... I give it FOUR STARS (which is high in my book!). If the attitudes were better and it was not so spray tan fakey - I would give it 10 stars (if TripAdvisor had that option). The room was fantastic!!!! Room 617 - great view, comfy bed, good tv, fine closet, clean... But the SHOWER, the SHOWER is what puts this hotel over the top. AMAZING! Rain forest like feel to the shower head, and you can open the ""shutters"" over the soaker tub and watch NYC life happen in front of your eyes WHILE SHOWERING. Loved it. Good location - Chelsea Market right around the corner. Not far from metro. Downstairs restaurant food selection at lunch time not that great but the flat bread was good.Downsides (besides the aforementioned snootiness) - DARK. I realize it is hip to be dark and moody, but SO DARK YOU CAN'T SEE IN THE ELEVATOR to push your room button is takin' it a tad bit too far. The whole place is dark (except in my room, where I controlled the lighting :) ). Other negative is price - quite expensive.Go for the view and the shower.

Quite a few hotels are, these days. However, pleasantly surprised to discover that this busy, trendy hang-out also doubles as a good business hotel. The Standard is two blocks from our NY office, which is a great start, but also made a good effort at looking after hotel guests as well as they do the guys using the bars and restaurants - not always the case. Funky reception with fast, courteous and efficient staff. I was welcomed back, even though my last stay was in '08. Rooms are a tad small but shower and bath are great. Good TV, very well-stocked minibar and amazing views over the Hudson. There are some great restaurants a short distance away, notably the Old Homestead, plus an Apple Store which is open until 2200. Check-out was a dream, considering it was at 0500. I rang down at 0455 to request my bill and to reserve a cab (you cannot book Yellow Cabs), four minutes later my bill was ready, the cab to JFK outside the door and the 'damage' very reasonable.

Are you looking for a quiet retreat for your family then you would probably be better of somewhere else.We found the rooms in The Standard to be rather small. We booked a standard king, which had a very small bathroom with a seperate claustrofobic toilet. The room also lacked sufficient storage space for your clothes. The room was clean though.The lack of roomspace did not bother us much, because the food/drink section of the hotel made up for that completely. On the ground floor there is the Grill restaurant with ample indoor & outdoor seating. Breakfast is also served there. The food is simple but really nice. Next door there's a German style Biergarten, where you should definitively try a couple of pints. Showpiece of the hotel is the Top of the Standard, a huge lounge bar on the 18th floor, with stunning views of Manhattan and the Hudson river.

The view from the room was fantastic and the restaurants and bars at the hotel outstanding. We used recommendations from the concierge for breakfast and lunch restaurants in the neighborhood and was amazed with their great knowledge and perfect recommendation to local treasures we would never have found on our own. So listen to their advices, they know their city! The rooms are nice, but small a little dark. It also look a little old and outdated. The staff at the grill and one of the outside bars (not the rooftop) are filled with staff that seems unexperienced and without the ability to manage the logistic. They would benefit enormously with training and improvement in service as they drag down the impression of the hotel quite a lot. With that said, the drinks are very good and the food at the grill are very good. The rooftop bar is fantastic and the waitresses certainly know how to make you feel welcome. The evening we visited the rooftop they had a live jazz band playing which gave the place a ""Great Gatsby"" feel to it. Over all, a very nice hotel and despite some flaws that drag down the impression I choose not to rob it from a star as the hotel is fresh and fun and I would stay here again.","Oslo, Norway",132,5.0

Let me start off by mentioning...the hotel rooms are tiny...even if we booked a Superior King Suite. I mean we had trouble putting our suitcase on the floor and opening it up since there are no real dressers or sufficient room to put away our clothes...so the suitcase stayed on the floor wide open. We even had trouble hanging our bath towels...only 2 hooks. We had friends also staying at the hotel...we tried having a happy hour before dinner...forget having 4 people comfortably seated. The amenities in the room are basic...at this price more than 350$/night; it should be high end, right? At checkout, I told front desk about this when they asked me how were the rooms. Their response was: Well, we are a boutique hotel after all. My answer: I have stayed at many boutique hotels in the past, in NYC and other cities worldwide, and I have never had such a miniscule room for that price. I would expect this in a lesser hotel chain thus less expensive, but not the Standard... I also think that guests should have a priority access to THEIR restaurants and bars...at least some kind of lame waiting list. Nope, nothing for hotel guests. So my suggestion is to enjoy the Standard but you do not have to be a guest at their hotel. Everybody has access to their restaurants and bars...guests or non-guests. They treat everyone the same. So why cough up the 700$ for a 2 night stay. This said, book somewhere else cheaper not too far away. I have to say, we did enjoy their restaurants and bars are great. The staff working at these eateries and bars are superb.","Montreal, Canada",2,3.0

If you are seeking a hip boutique hotel in the heart of the city - this is a great option. In Chelsea, it is walking distance from TriBeCa, SoHo, NoLita, and all the other great parts of the city. The incorporation of High Line is unique. The room was spacious by NYC standards - equipped with little touches (complimentary umbrella, iron, docking station, etc.). The rooftop bar boasts a great view - particularly at sunset. However, the scene is exactly what you'd expect for a hipster bar in the meatpacking district.Unfortunately, the hotel misses the mark for an excellent rating. Despite multiple requests, the chambermaid did not change my broken table top ironing board. And while the staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful, the maintenance guy who came to fix the dead battery in the phone was not the most polite. The room decor was stylish but the construction was a little sloppy (e.g., uneven tiles at the bathroom entrance). While there is a large bath, the shower is a European style that floods the bathroom - not my first choice in bathroom design. Again, it is a very good hotel and I would consider staying there again but it is not in the same league as some other options in a city with a plethora of boutique hotels.","Toronto, Canada",69,4.0

Cabs stop right on the doorstep And I didn't have any problem in this department whilst I was there.The rooms were nothing to write home about, but generally adequate. They are extremely small, which whilst not uncommon for NY, are Certainly far smaller than others in that price range. There is no separate bathroom, and instead it is at one end of the bedroom with a glass screen (pretty cheap trick and hope you aren't expecting privacy?!). No complimentary water or anything is provided and the general feel is more one of a cheap motel in the room.All of this is tolerable albeit in no way particularly impressive for the price, however the one thing that really bothered me was the facilities. The roof bar and club, are run by some of the most obnoxious snooty and arrogant characters I've had the misfortune of meeting. So exclusive are they trying to be that despite paying 500 dollars or so to stay there, you're not actually allowed to visit your own rooftop bar after a certain time without begging and bartering with the idiot on the door to let you in!! On discussing this with the receptionist I was flippantly told I ought to try and get on the DJs invite list?! Sorry...but that isn't the way it works in a quality hotel! The restaurant is also a high quality restaurant, but absolutely no preference/allowance is given to those staying there. In short, you end up In a Situation where you can't eat at the hotel restaurant and you can't drink at the hotel bar!! And all of this whilst your paying hundreds of dollars to stay there. The management really need to work out what their preference is here, you can't expect people to spend those bucks and not at the very least ensure they can use the hotel restaurants and bars at will.I am returning to NY in a couple of weeks, but I won't be back to the Standard.

Again, I distinctly remember Scott and Caitlin as being some of the best hotel staffers I've ever encountered (and I stay in schamancy hotels relatively frequently, and don't typically find myself so good with remembering anyone's name -- these two stood out). Usually I find the staff at hotels like the Standard are a little off-putting and cold, but Scott and Caitlin couldn't have been warmer, friendlier or more helpful. A+++ to whoever is doing the hiring at the High Line.- Food! We ate at the Standard Grill twice (brunch and dinner), and both meals were impeccable. The service at the Grill wasn't nearly as good as it was otherwise in the hotel, but still perfectly fine and the food totally stood out. And the characters who frequent the Grill on a Sunday night are something to behold! Worth the $$$ for people-watching alone.- The Boom Boom Room! While this was my first time actually staying at the Standard High Line, I've been to the Boom Boom Room on more than a few occasions before with friends who live in NYC, and I maintain that it is the most beautiful bar I have ever been in, or likely will ever be in. An exceptional room with the kinds of views that dreams are made of. The cocktails aren't half-bad, either.- Bathtub! With a glass of champagne and fresh pears from room service + a book + my boyfriend, I fear I shant say more, but OMGGGG. The bathtub/shower sitch alone makes the Superior King room at the Standard worth every penny.Lowlights:- Compared with Midtown, the rooms are pretty small (but then again, so is everything/everywhere in NYC). The designers made really really good use of the space, that said, so you don't feel caged in like you do some other places (ahem, the W....)- None.

I love the building and the area so The Standard High Line was a natural choice.My room was on the 13th floor (no superstition) and faced downtown. View was OK (Whitney Museum of American Art in progress). The room is fairly spacious for NYC. Loved the little nook with the bench and table.My disappointment is with the little attention you are given. I stayed two nights. Complimentary water was offered only on the first night. Turn down service was offered only on the first night as well... I'm used to little attentions (like next day's weather, a chocolate etc.) with turn down - especially at this price range (even in NYC).

High floor, 2 from the top, no issues with noise from the club above. Rooms have incredible views and are very interesting, to the say the least. Yes the rooms are tiny but they are very modern in style, with full floor to ceiling windows and see-through window into the shower. Highline is right there, so its great access to walking on a nice day. There are tons of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity too. The general area has a lot to offer in the same regard. Maybe the best location in the city to be a homebase for a visit.The hotel staff is very good and valet/check-in/etc was a breeze. The drinks and food at the hotel establishments are very good. Recommend the hotel restaurant for breakfast/brunch and the outdoor patio for drinks. The top-floor bar makes great, if not super expensive drinks, but good vibe and awesome views. It is worth the visit.The rooftop club was not open during our stay. The beer garden gets packed so get there early to avoid a line. Note that you get no special consideration at any hotel clubs, bars, or restaurants for being a hotel guest.

The bar at the top is nice too, albeit a bit pricey. The rooms on the other hand are very average. While nicely decorated, my queen superior room was tiny and had a ""peekaboo"" shower (which means someone can just sit there and watch you shower through a glass wall) - so if I was sharing, it would have made for some interesting moments.

It was teeny tiny (and I know that hotel rooms in NYC are smaller than usual) but this was a joke. The bed was up against the shower and on the floor. There was no way two people could share the bed without crawling on each other. The closet and bathroom were awful. It looked as thought they had forgotten to clean several areas of the room. I called to the front desk and they had no other rooms to move me into. I checked out immediately and went across the street where I payed 1/2 the price- and the room was twice as big and much cleaner and nicer! The front desk manager at The Standard High Line said they were not going to charge me for the evening because I didn't stay in the room and because they could not offer me another room.

The room itself had fixed ""window-walls"" that gave a beautiful view of the city. All-in-all the modern style of the hotel and the ""old world modern"" style of the rooms didn't match.When I went to use the bathroom in my room the light died immediately. To change the bulb required a screwdriver and I had checked in late. I was also woken up by the room below me, since the bed is next to the windows, which sound travels through quite well.

My recommendation: If you're looking to party and don't care about money than I'd highly recommend this hotel, but stay in one of the highest tier rooms. Also make sure to have non-sneaker dress shoes and pants other than jeans if you hope to enter the lounge.",,3,4.0

The weather may have been single digits, but combined with massages & dinner, I’m very happy with our decision to stay local as we reminisced about our nice & warm, beach wedding. Ahh, nostalgia… Thinking back to our experience, a few things stand out. First, our corner room (#823) had floor to ceiling windows on 3 sides. While laying in bed, it literally felt like we were floating as we took in the view of TriBeCa, New Jersey & Midtown. I have never been in a hotel room that evoked similar feelings. The huge bathtub (for 2) is also positioned so that you can chill out and enjoy the tri-angle views. It really provided an enjoyable segue to our late dinner at Spice Market (1 block away). The standalone shower with glass walls definitely added to the mood as well, this room was clearly designed with happy couples in mind. Second, the front desk staff at The Standard seem to be trained exceptionally well. It’s common in many hotels for the staff to be polite, it’s a given. However, the staff at The Standard are conscious that their clientele are upscale and accustomed to white glove treatment. From the receptionist, to the bellhop, to the doorman and concierge, everyone makes it a point to continuously let guests know that they are there to serve them, in any way. It’s a very warm feeling. It’s kind of like when you are at home and hosting one of your parent’s boss for dinner. Obviously mom’s boss can take the fine china home if she likes it that much. I spoke with the manager, Paul Kashman, and conveyed our elation with the chic, upscale ambience. It’s evident that Paul has been doing this for many years. Lastly, we went to the Soho House for massages at Cowshed Spa. We are not members at Soho House, but because we were staying at The Standard, we were able to obtain access. I’m not sure if access to Soho House is possible otherwise, but checking out the private club was a nice touch. Although we live in Manhattan, the last few days have consisted of me thinking (a few times) of occasions for which we can have another stay-cation at The Standard. I look forward to it.","New York City, New York",1,5.0

It is a boutique hotel; ultra modern. Appears to be a hotel for the beautiful and cool. A very trendy place with very, very small rooms (as most are in NYC). The place is easy to find; just look for the upside-down logo (by design of course). Location is excellent (meat packing district) and a walk around is a must. There is a cool beer garden next door. This is a cool and pricey hotel with a few quirks... Not exactly sure how to describe it, but the bed mattresses set directly on the floor; no frame. So it's a little low for me getting up in AM but I got used to it. The patio bat outside is cool; service average to below average.

Got an ok rate - $365/night room only for a deluxe king. I really enjoyed staying here. It's not a perfect hotel - there's no proper wardrobe or any drawers, for example, but it's fun. I had a room with views onto the Hudson, and down to the highline below. Spacious enough for one person, but if I was coming back as a couple, I would try to book one of the corner rooms or a studio. Huge soaking tub with a rainfall shower, and ok in-house toiletries. Lots of mirrors in the room for checking yourself out.. Had room service one night - not great - a bit cold and only so-so taste-wise. Great drinks menu though. Had breakfast in the Grill on the ground floor each morning - quiet, fast, tasty. Used the gym a couple of times - it's worth going to just for the views. Not so great in terms of free weights, but ok selection of cardio machines. Location is great, I guess depending in what you want. Personally, I love the meatpacking district, and the hotel is also a short walk from Chelsea. Lots of great restaurants nearby- Pastis, and also this place the hotel recommended, called Willow Road. Service was good. My only note would be to recommend only modifying room bookings online, rather than over the phone - I spoke to a reservation agent twice to make some changes to my booking, but when I logged in the day before arrival, I saw nothing had been changed. And my other gripe would be with the slightly shabby-looking bedspread/eiderdown. One of the highlights of the stay - the bar on the top floor. I had a great time with some colleagues- and I'm not even that much a fan of bars. Or fun. Wonderful live music, more great views, and a good cocktail menu. The hotel feels a bit like a younger version of the Andaz - which I also like. Would definitely go back - but book a larger room next time. ",London,68,4.0

The beds are the most comfortable hotel beds that I have ever slept in just what you need when the jet lag kicks in. Rooms with great views, I prefer an end room facing the Hudson although the city views are just as good a high floor is a must! I'd also recommend a room with a bath that over looks the city they are so cool. Reception staff really welcoming with a ""Welcome back Mr Johnson"" just what you expect from a hotel of this standard, nothing seems to be too much trouble, also really accommodating with last minute change, I made several changes because my plans kept changing and they just changed with me with no hassle (thanks Joseph)Check out is a breeze with great attention to detail, you get that great service till you get into the taxi, even the bell hop boys are cool and rather cute!Roof top bar is a must, great cocktail amazing views and again just a really cool vibe, can get a little chilly depending on the time of year summer night are so cool. Restaurants in the hotel are really good, pizzas if you want something easy (they are really good) and the other more formal restaurant is also great I'd book a table tho. Thing I'd recommend are duck meatballs and the breakfast menu is just as you'd expect from a good NY restaurant. The best mini bar is great, just really quirky and fun, you'll know what I mean when you see it. Great location for shopping and other great restaurants. Even the lifts are really cool and again you'll know what I mean when you're in one. I'm really looking forward to my next visit which will be in a couple of weeks So to sum up this review, for me this is one of the coolest hotels in the city, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone I look forward to staying there every time I go and never leave thinking I had a bad stay. #reallycoolhotel#cooltrendyvibe",Worcester,3,5.0

I had stayed at The Standard once before without my husband and was looking forward to sharing the experience with him to celebrate my birthday. Upon check in, Paul at the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. Any concern that the Hotel might treat one differently for not having paid full price by using the Hotel Tonight app was quickly dissolved. He could not have been more accommodating and excited to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Learning it was my birthday he eagerly upgraded us to a corner room. The views were exceptional!!! The room was extremely clean and the decor is modern and comfortable. The bed was heavenly as I completely enjoyed not only sleeping past 10 am but also taking a two hour nap!The location is AMAZING! The best restaurants - definitely check out the Chelsea Market (an excellent recommendation from the concierge!) Also eat at the Standard Grille and if you can go up to the Boom Boom Room the decor is out of this world!!!! The Beer Garden is a great place to go for a drink as well. The shopping in The Meat Packing is fantastic! Every brand you love has their own boutique store - also try to go to Jeffrey's for the most amazing boutique department store in NYC.All in all, we will definitely be back and keep our fingers crossed that The Standard continues its relationship with Hotel Tonight as we will always choose to stay there given the option.","New York City, New York",10,5.0

We were having an event that night in the city and since I live in CT, we decided to spend the night in the city. I got the room on HotelTonight. When my husband got to the hotel, they offered him an upgrade for $80 a night. He immediately said no - but the woman insisted and said she would give it to him for free anyway (my guess is they ran out of the room they were supposed to give us). They told him no charge, but made him sign a few papers, which he didn't review carefully. The next day there was a charge for $93.80 on our card! I protested with Amex, but since my husband had signed, there was nothing that could be done. So please be careful about signing anything, even if they offer you a free upgrade, because it is NOT free. FYI - I don't see how the room was an upgrade anyway.

NO Not at all. It is a new standard for design and management failure. But does offer good small beds and a decent internet connection...Design: The Standard rooms so small that it is virtually impossible to place two normal suitcases and hang shirts, suits or dresses for a weekend stay. The shower so small and horribly designed that there is no room for a shower curtain or door. Water, water everywhere. A Bavarian hoopa hoopa bar in the ground floor retail maze including dirndls en bellies. Is this is the top of trendiness? Maybe in Munich anno 1845Comfort:Yes! Good beds. Not the rock hard standard of some pseudo hotels. The Standard beds are a small standard. A sort of dwarf-king size like in Snow White… But at least sleepable. Yes, someone was thinking. The bed comfort is the only reason why any one would really pay for this hotel. The beds are good. Hoteliers everywhere, this is the Standard to follow.Quiet:It seems for some victims that a throbbing bass beat is necessary everywhere. Some even wear there DJ headphones to bed. NOT at the Standard. At the Standard all-night bass beats are included in every room. The city that never sleeps. Now we know why. The Standard’s own anti-sleep standard. A club on the 18th floor. Guests in the hotel, however are NOT welcome. Unless they wish to settle their bill at the bar and then follow the terse instructions to go outside and wait in the rain and cold to be ‘selected for re-entry’ Now this is the standard that the real victims of trend traps are seeking? Facilities: Working internet: perfect for seeking a good hotel alternative or to write your Trip Advisor notes...A good gym: to work off your frustrations, or to change clothes to go out. As there is no space in your guest room to do this. Good mirrors in the gym. Thank you for the Standard.Pricing: The price of a room. Just slightly higher than a real hotel with proper room comfort, trendy design, great views and genuine service. In addtion to the exhorbitant room price: A three micro-wave mini-ravioli appetizer: US$27.00 plus tax and service: $35.00 on a mini plate with a paper napkin. Fabulous view included. The Standard. Attitude:Drop a few hundred dollars at the 18th floor bar or even a few $1000 and you are sent to the street below to get screened for access to the throbbing bass club on the ….18th floor. The real trend victims will love this Standard of gracious service. Keep it coming.On check out: “Was everything ok” asked the trendy reception manager? Not quite what I expected.” Was my honest answer. To which the Standard reply: “see you next time!”And last but certainly not least; The person at the Standard whose task it is to respond to The Trip Advisor…. So many ways to put a positive spin on a negative experience. You deserve the Standard prize for deceptive writing. Second Standard in NYC??? Are there so many victims?, or will the second Standard be a better Standard. Watch Trip Advisor for more…","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",26,1.0

And what's on the inside are friendly, courteous, well-humoured staff throughout, funky fittings and fixtures, a well-stocked gift shop, lifts with TVs that transport you to an alternate universe and an intimate bar. And that's all before you get to the rooms. Mine, a Junior Liberty Suite, featured floor to ceiling glass windows looking out onto the Hudson River. From various vantage points within the room, I could see the Statue Of Liberty, the Freedom Tower and - around a corner - the Empire State Building. Spectacular.The king-size bed was comfortable, the pillows were the softest I've EVER slept on, the room has a unique - and pleasing - scent and the temperature was always spot on, despite the sub-zero conditions outside.There was a gorgeous stand-alone bath, a glass shower (albeit with no privacy screen - so know your roommate well) and plenty of sofa space.I dined twice in the Standard Grill downstairs and not only was the food of the highest standard (pardon the pun), the service was also first rate.There was also a mini ice-skating rink at the front entrance, with a chalet next to it serving hot chocolates... the perfect way to spend a winter hour or two.Yes, there's a nightclub upstairs which can result in a few thumping basslines working their way down, but who'd travel to a big city expecting complete silence? I take earplugs wherever I travel.Taxis are easily accessible at the front of the building, there are some great shops and restaurants within metres of the door, the High Line walk is literally beneath the hotel and Chelsea Market is just two blocks to the north. I can't recommend The Standard High Line highly enough. A spectacular start to an extremely memorable trip. Five star all the way.","Melbourne, Australia",57,5.0

The room was well laid out with a nice table with bulkhead style seating and a separete chair where you could sit to eat or sip wine and absorb the amazing view. The bed was also super comfortable and the glass shower added a quirky element to the room. It did however repeatably steam up the external windows of the room, despite having the fan on the maximum setting. We could only 'unfrost' the widows by repeatedly opening the window - not ideal in a New York winter.Unfortunately the service let the hotel down considerably. Our one room service request over four nights never arrived and our one interaction with the concierge, who undertook to find us a a local dinner reservation for New Years Eve, took three follow ups (over 2 days) both over the phone and in person before a vacancy was found in the Standard Grill (One of the hotels own restuarants) despite being previously told was completely booked out.The bar on th 18th floor has some good views but it took us half an hour to get a drink. This included trying to attract the attention of the waitresses roaming the floor (we were seated at a table) and also trying to queue up at the bar. It seemed pretty obvious that the bar targets the trendy Meatpacking 'wannabe' crowd, rather than guests.Unfortunately, as mentioned by previous reviewers, there is now a building site beside the hotel on the city side and we were woken each morning, apart from a public holiday, to a jackhammer pounding away at 7.00am.The hotel lacks warmth and friedliness and we were constantly reminded by staff that the meatpacking district is the 'happening and in' place in NYC at the moment. Maybe they should forget that, drop the attitude and concentrate on providing a better service so that guests will return.....Oh, the doghnuts from the stall outside the front of the hotel next to the ice skating rink were amazing, best ones we have ever had!

I was set for the place to be snotty, with chilly ""better than you"" service. But, from the valet parkers to the doormen to the coffee bar server to the front desk clerk, everyone was cordial and welcoming. The Standard takes price in its chi-chi rep but no one takes themselves too seriously. Fabulous accommodations , low-key, super clean furnishings and the most comfortable hotel bed I've been in in a long time. The room was lacking a few things: 1) an in room Keurig-type coffee maker that's become derigeur, 2) a generous selection of bathroom amenity extras guests have come to expect from high end hotels -- here, there was only shampoo, conditioner and lotion -- and 3) drywall between the shower and the bed. In our queen room, only a pane of shower glass separated those in the douche from others in the room so unless you like putting on a Show for your roommate, trust him when he says he won't peek or have no modesty, you may have a problem. Overnight, the room was blissfully quiet (except for the confused drunken woman who banged on our door in error at 3am ... But that can happen anywhere..). Luckily, we had an early morning because construction across Washington Street started bright and early. It is a very long term project that soundproof window glass can't muffle. But, that's NYC and we weren't bothered. This winter, the hotel set up an ice skating rink in front of the building which was a real treat.

Stayed on a Saturday so there was no construction going on as far as I can tell, but I imagine some weekdays will have noise.The skating rink is small but fun - great for kids. If you are expecting to get any speed - go to Chelsea Piers a little ways away (though it's not outdoors!). It was too warm to use it while I stayed but I've used it before and enjoyed it - the boozy hot chocolate they serve there is highly recommended.The peekaboo shower is definitely couples-only.. if you are going with someone who you would rather not have you see take a shower, make sure they are out of the room at that time!Ended up ordering room service and it was surprisingly good - the simple pasta dish was very tasty, and the artic char was a decent value and tasty as well.Perhaps my favorite part of the hotel was the funky music/video they have playing in the elevator.","New York City, New York",4,4.0

For 2 nights the room was fine, if I had to do a full business week or 2 there I would probably not be inclined to do so. The work area in the room is great but just general manuevering and settling into the room not so much.It was literally living out of the suitcase, the way the room is structured you really can't settle in, at least the way the room I had was structured.In addition due to the great popularity of this hotel and its restaurants/bars, just popping in for a quick easy meal or drink after work or arriving in, not really an option.

We've been to NYC a few times, but this was our first time staying in this area - it was right up our alley - in general a quieter spot in the city, on top of the High Line, a block from the L subway line, and plenty to see and do nearby.The hotel itself was good, but not great. We got a deal on Jetsetter, and upon arriving early in the morning, were able to get in to our room before noon. Unfortunately they forgot to bring our luggage up 'within 5 minutes' as promised, but an hour later when we reminded them, it came right away. There's free wifi, the room was a good size for New York, and the giant tub was a bonus. Note that it's very easy to see in the rooms from outside, so use the blackout shade when you need privacy, and hopefully you're not shy in your room because there's a window between the shower and bedroom area. The bed was huge and comfy, and the fully equipped gym is open 24/7 and has a great view. The hotel is a noisy place - there was construction right next door which included jackhammering early in the morning, and being on the 15th floor, even though we were assured it was a 'quieter' floor, we were able to hear the party-thumping bass from the top floor on the Saturday night of our stay, and the doors are pretty thin, too. So just a warning if noise is an issue for you. Service was fine for us, but not above and beyond as I was expecting in a boutique hotel of this sort. There's no coffee/tea in your room, and the price of a coffee in the lobby is kinda silly ($4 for a regular coffee!), but Chelsea Market is nearby for some good grub.

First they rent out parts of the hotel for private events, not a big deal except due to that we had to walk outside to access the hotel restaurant. It was about 20 degrees and I was not happy that I had to go back to my room to get a jacket and walk around the block outside the hotel to the hotel restaurant to accommodate extra revenue for the hotel. Not cool!Second issue; In the early morning it's almost impossible to get a coffee. I left for work and was told in the lobby that if I wanted coffee to order room service. BTW it was a 30+ minute wait for room service. Needless to say I could not wait. Several other business people were struggling with the same problem. While the lack of morning coffee is not a deal killer it's kind of a joke....Regardless I would recommend staying here, the value is great, the people are pretty and the area has amazing restaurants in walking distance. No place is perfect and for the price/location I can work around their gaps....",Texas,18,4.0

His company only picks the trendiest, coolest, hippest places. This place is GREAT! Yes the rooms are a little tight, but aren't they all in NY?!?! Yes there is a ""nudie"" shower. If you are looking for family friendly this is not the place, however, they are family friendly. My 3 and 4 year old LOVE it here. I kinda feel embarrassed walking in the halls with my kids when I pass by the trendy singles on the way to the club. The staff here is AWESOME!! My kids have not been to happy with all the fancy meals, and just wanted a good ol' fashion mac and cheese, so the lady at the front desk, took our kraft single and heated it up for us. Then she had a microwave delivered to our room to use for the rest of the week. When we checked in, we asked about a roll away bed, I think they wanted to laugh at us, but the front desk staff was so nice and wonderful she gave us a complimentary upgrade to a King Superior ( I don't think I would have survived a week in something smaller with my two kiddos). My kids LOVE the crazy video in the elevator. We have temporarily lost our room key while getting on the elevator, but someone has always helped us out. The cleaning staff is good. The front desk staff is helpful and nice and friendly. The ""guys out front""( bell man!?!?) are THE BEST!!! They walk to the door and open it for us ( yes, we have a double stroller and barely fit in any establishment in NY), they help us with the cabs, so friendly and I would want them to marry any one of my single girlfriends. I could go on about this AWESOME place... I would stay here again (preferably with out my children and heck maybe even my husband ... hahaha). So if you are cool rich and single come here.. IF you are with kids and husband come here and pretend you are cool rich and single! Great Atmosphere with an amazing STAFF!!! I really don't want to leave...","Detroit, Michigan",101,4.0

Major selling points for me were:- Having emailed ahead to request a mid level floor (for a view without the club noise) and a 'tub with a view', when I arrived after a long and delayed Amtrak ride, I was greeted warmly by Irina who happily accommodated my request by allocating me a corner room on the 12th floor, with stunning views of both the Hudson River and the Empire State Building. - The view was just as good from the shower and tub, and really is worth every penny.- The hotel enjoys a great location above the Highline Park, a stones throw from Chelsea Market, well served by the A,C, E and L trains and a pleasant walk from Greenwich Village, SoHo, Tribeca and LES. - There were always cabs available outside.- The room is well stocked with essential toiletries, a varied minibar, radio, TV, good linens and bath robes. - Complimentary Wifi throughout the hotel- Everything was perfectly clean; the heating A/C is easy to use and despite the high floor you can open the windows (safely). - On floor 12 I experienced no street noise and minimal noise (a very feint thump thump of bass) only on one evening.- Room service was quick, friendly and efficientWhere I felt the hotel falls short is- I wasn't surprised to hear that the rooftop bars were closed, which was a bit disappointing, but there's plenty else to do in the area; and the view is equally good from the room. (I'd expect a top class hotel to keep this space open to guests at all times)- No complimentary bottled water - such a basic thing, which doesn't cost a lot but makes guests feel looked after (particularly for Brits who are used to tea and coffee making facilities in room)- Speaking of which, a coffee maker/ Nespresso machine wouldn't go amiss- No turn down service (far from essential, but does make you feel looked after on holiday)- A moot point - but the TV was slightly mistuned and could have greatly benefitted from a listings function. Plus the selection of on demand movies was poor. I guess New York is entertainment enough though!In summary - would I stay again? Absolutely yes - the Standard Highline is in a great location with unbeatable views, and nicely appointed rooms. As a 4* it is very cool and comfortable, so it's achieving what it sets out to do. I just think perhaps they are missing a trick, as with a few little extra touches it could be a really great guest experience. I'd love to see them take a leaf out of the Andaz's book and offer complimentary coffee and soft drinks in room, and a wine hour in the lobby.","Bath, United Kingdom",25,4.0

You're right next to the Highline, the Chelsea Market, great restaurants and within walking distance to Union Square, SOHO, Chelsea and many other great neighborhoods in New York. The biergarden is the other highlight - it's adjacent to the hotel and $12 will buy you a pint of beer and a pretzel (not bad for New York). There's a gym on the 17th floor, but only 2 of the treadmills were working. It's very clean and overlooks the Hudson.The downside to the hotel is that the rooms are small and the hotel is loud (there's a club on the 18th floor and I could hear music in my room until 4am and I was on the 10th floor). Also, I stayed here with a friend and the bathroom offers little privacy. There's a glass wall between the shower and the bedroom area (the hotel will put a curtain up for you upon request); however, there's no door to the bathroom (only for the toilet).

It is right on the edge of the peninsula, so has great (in fact, stunning) views over the Hudson in one direction and midtown Manhattan in the other.We were on the 14th foor in a superior king room with direct views to the Empire State Building - it was a sight you would just not tire of seeing. The room was well configured to make use of the space, and had a separate seating area which was nice for a longer stay. There was not much in the way of storage space but this didn't bother us (we could hang up the odd item of clothing that really needed it; we tend not to fully unpack when we travel anyway). The bed was big and very confortable. The bathroom was also generous but I can imagine some people would be put off the glass wall between the bath/shower and bedroom which meant you could still enjoy the view whilst you were in the bathroom (the toilet itself was behind a door mind you - that might have been one step too far!).The location of the hotel was great for us, a few blocks from 14th Street subway which gave us great (quick and easy) transport links but away from the main tourist areas which might have become overwhelming if you didn't have a hotel elsewhere to escape from it all. It is also on the edge of the Village which was my favourite area to just wander around - that felt like real New York to me.The only downside we found was the fact that in the evening the lift (elevator) area is reconfigured to allow two of the four of the lifts to service the queue for the nightclub and bar at the top of the hotel, whilst the other two were left for hotel guests returning in the evening. The lifts themselves are quite large, so apart from the one night when the lifts appeared to stop recognising the guests' room keys to allow them to access the bedroom floors we did not have to queue. It was only that the reconfiguration was confusuing to guests who were not expecting it and every night there were, without fail, a handful of people who were trying to get to the bar / club through the hotel itself and being redirected to the queue outside and in the process clogging up the narrow corridor to the lifts. This is though a minor point and I would certainly return to this hotel.","Manchester, United Kingdom",1,4.0

I must say, almost everything about this chic hotel is great. Of course (everybody says it) the location in the meatpacking district and on the High Line absolutely is value-added to the experience. The staff at the front desk on our arrival was extremely nice (though the hostess' ""cleavage"" was a little distracting for this aging hipster I confess). Request a room in the higher floors for the views if possible, but I understand you don't want to be under the club on the top floors or right near the elevator. It was just a little too chilly to spend our first evening at the rooftop bar -- but the views from there were stunning. You just gotta go up there!I must say, the rooms do seem SMALL and a bit cramped, although well-designed. Bathrooms have HUGE tubs and super-comfy beds ==> the bed is too low to the floor for my taste & comfort. I guess this is a ""design thing"" because of the floor-to-ceiling windows. This is certainly not a hotel for fuds (I also stubbed my toe a few times on the mini step-up to the bathroom) -- and I certainly did not like getting turned away at the elegant upstairs bar first time around [for wearing sneakers not shoes]. Drinks at the bar were uber pricey -- but I suppose if you are paying the price of staying at this hotel, just be prepared to go with the flow! We had Saturday and Sunday breakfasts in the cozy bistro-café. Excellent breakfast food. For dinner I recommend Fig & Olive around the corner.

The room itself was comfortable. The ADA designation means that there is no bathtub, only a shower and the bathroom is large enough for a wheelchair to maneuver and has grab bars.

The products had a nice Aveda-like scent but are not Aveda. The bed seemed spongy upon sitting on it, but for sleeping, it was very comfortable. Except for some loud-talkers in the hallway and the noise from the brass monkey, there wasn't much noise beyond the background din of the city. I use the earplugs to block out my partner's snoring!There is a mini bar in a fridge for beverages and a cabinet above for snacks. I couldn't find the price list anywhere in the room. There are wine glasses, an ice bucket, a wine opener in the room. There was a candle in the room but wasn't sure if this was a mini bar item or part of the amenities.The TV planted in the floor may have been a cool design idea (and perhaps helps with sound) but it interferes with getting out of one side of the bed and with the view. The heating/cooling worked well and didn't give us any problems.Facilities:The gym on the 17th floor is decent and has great views. There are about 6-8 cardio machines and maybe 2-4 weight machines. There are also some free weights. Not a lot of room for floor work, though.The open air rooftop bar and lounge is fun for a late afternoon/early evening drink. The upholstered furniture had nasty stains on it, so we stuck to the webbed chairs. The boom boom room has some marvelous views of the city and cozy spots to sit by a fireplace. If you want a drink here, you'll need to get it yourself. The staff only seem interested in serving certain tables. The plaza bar is good for people watching. Not all the seating has overhead heaters, so pay attention if you are sitting outside and want to be warm.The Standard Grill front room is a pleasant spot to have breakfast. Service is efficient and friendly. The servers wear funky plaid pants and vests. I suggest the hotel re-work the continental breakfast from the 1 hot (coffee/tea), 1 cold bev (orange/grapefruit juice), choice of pastries and choice of toast to work in some protein and fruit. Who needs pastries AND toast? Plus there are enough pastries in one person's order to feed two people. Continental breakfast was included in our room package,Getting up to the club late at night is impossible without an invitation or guest list privileges. We didn't inquire with the concierge about getting in ahead of time, so maybe that is how it works.They separate the guest elevators from the club elevators at night so we didn't experience the mix-up of club-goers and hotel guests I've read on other reviews.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",0,4.0

The woman who checked me in was very nice but must have forgotten to pull her shirt up because her cleavage was spewing out of her bra and shirt. Maybe its a New York thing?... Anyway, after waiting for an elevator to be open, I finally made it to my room. But, not so fast now..... my key didn't work. So I had to go all the way down to the front desk to ask for another. NOT so easy, it took me 20-25 minutes. They only had one set of elevators for drunk party goers and guests!!!!Room at first glance: OMG the shower is in see through. Maybe it was a little bit of my own fault but I didn't know all the showers where totally exposed. I am a semi private conservative normal person, and i don't want anyone who is staying with me being able to watch me shower... kinda awkward. THANKFULLY i was not traveling with anyone! The room did have a beautiful floor to ceiling window that was probably the length of my arms time two. It was neat and tidy. The bathroom shower had beautiful tiles. Hopefully if I was staying with someone they would be so memorized by it they wouldn't be looking at me trying to shower.Checking out:This was a nightmare in a half. I had them valet my car but no one told me they were closing the street down for a parade. So I had to wait hours to get my car, along with a slew of angry travelers.

Prices are okay, and cheaper in the office season. But the service just [anger word] sucks! Again and again and again the service sucked on a two day trip.- greeters / maitres-d: why are these people so digustingly sour? seriously who do they think they are. When you want a table they look at you like you are disrupting their spa therapy, what total idiocy. Just give me a freaking table and stop acting like a fool. - breakfast: had to ask three times for milk, twice reminded orange juice order, no spoon for tea, two servers not-coordinating, just annoying.- reception: almost always empty, and never welcoming. so pathetic. six terminals and usually no more than two people on service. At one point, I stood looking in horror at a reception that for a some horrifying minutes had not a single soul at front of house. I don't remember a hotel in the world where there was no-one at reception. - terrace bar: again, no-one giving me a table, no-one noticing I wanted to order when I had a table, and then when a party of 5 grew to 8, being told we couldn't expand the table (fire regs? what rubbish, there was no clear access already, and we could have arranged tables to ensure it). - elevators: this BS makes me want to scream. what is going on with all these non-hotel guests crashing the elevators in the evening? when you come back tired, wanting to get to your room, you have to navigate all that horror. stop it immediately. And the staff, using the guest elevators for luggage, waste, housecleaning, whatever. This is a clownshow. Get it sorted. AND ENOUGH WITH THE BROKEN ELEVATORS. - guest priority: when I wake up on Sunday in your hotel I want breakfast. Is that some kind of surprise? so why do I have to wait in a huge queue of non-hotel guests for the privilege of eating in my own hotel, not to mention navigating the wall of sour that the greeters desk represents. And please, I've read your replies here. You sound like you listen, but never offer to actually look into anything. Try and fix this stuff.

Now lets talk about this hotels MAJOR FLAW.... Guests should not be made to grovel, beg or wine to gain access to a roof top that is advertised on its website. In fact, the website should be updated to reflect the extremely limited and almost non-existance access for hotel guests. Our first night on the roof top was fantastic. Unfortunately all of the other nights were supposedly guest list only. I thought this had to be a joke since it once of the prominent selling features of the property on the website. After speaking with management we were assured this would not be an issue the third night of our stay. To our dismay, yes the less than friendly door staff used the guest list line again! The manager of the property apologized and comped our party its entire drink bill at The Grill. FYI, this is a great place to eat! The service, food and ambiance is awesome! We ate here twice during our stay. Again, at this price point guest should be given priority access and or guest list access to the rood OR DISCLOSE it on the website otherwise that you may or MAY NOT be able to enjoy the roof top.

We're a 50+ semi retired couple and have been to NY a couple of times before and we're looking for a different experience. The reviews of the Standard sounded great so we jumped in. Our first concern was the reported noise from the roof top night club so we took the advice received on this site and asked for a room on the 9th to 11th floors and received one, through a special request, on the 10th floor. This was an excellent outcome as we heard no noise from above during the week we were there, including Friday and Saturday nights.The room was good - a good size for NY and, as we upgraded, we had a fantastic view of lower Manhattan and the Hudson River. Great morning and night time views from the wall of glass in the room. Don't be put off by the comments in other reviews as, in our room at least, we had real curtains that we could pull across for privacy, but we enjoyed leaving the curtains open as we turned in to see the skyline and lights down Washington St each night.We did go up to the roof top lounge one night and enjoyed the fantastic skyline views but avoided the nightclub - just too old for that but were amused each night as we saw the constant stream of young and beautiful people coming and going. Even as we left on our last day at 4:30 am to catch an early flight we were amazed at the activity in the hotel!Service was unpredictable and we were a little disappointed in the occasional careless attitude we experienced. Having said that, we were totally impressed with the service received from a young concierge, Tim, who arranged 4 dinner bookings for us, including at the popular Locande Verde. Thanks, Tim. The concierge also arranged a car to take us to the airport which was ideal at the early hour we had to leave.On the down side, we had to ask for more soap and the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about 9 am until we decided to put out the Do Not Disturb sign to allow us to have a good sleep before heading out to discover the delights of lower Manhattan.The hotel is located over the High Line and is in the very popular Meatpacking District. We loved it there and enjoyed walking through Chelsea, SoHo, Little Italy etc each day. The shopping, cafés and restaurants in these areas are nothing less than excellent.

We had to book 2 rooms as there was no way an extra bed would fit in any of the rooms, not even the suites. The standard room was aptly described as a ""capsule"" by another TripAdvisor reviewer. My husband and I stayed in a corner suite which was only slightly larger but considerably more expensive. We were very disappointed with the service often spending half an hour before someone took our order and another half an hour trying to track someone down to sign for the bill. The service in the restaurant (The Standard Bar and Grill) was appalling with the waiter forgetting our requests and leaving us unattended for lengthy periods. The roof top bar is a great place to view the lights of Manhattan but after 11pm the hotel lift will not take you up there and we had to line up outside to gain entry to the lift. I will not stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it as I think it is overpriced for the experience.","Sydney, Australia",137,3.0

I was a little nervous because of the mixed reviews. However, I really enjoyed the hotel. We were in a Hudson Studio with views in three different direction: uptown, downtown and the Hudson. We could see the Statute of Liberty, the Freedom Tower, and the Empire State building. Just amazing. I think some of the reviewers with negative comments go to the Highline with the wrong expectations. It is not a luxurious, cushy hotel. It has a different vibe. Its styling is more modern and trendy but that is okay and the décor reflects this modern and minimalist style. We found the staff to be great, from the valet parkers, to the beautiful and friendly receptionist and to the restaurant staff at the Standard Grill. Room service for breakfast was fast and friendly. We did not have a problem getting into Le Bain, even though we were older than the typical patron. Although it wasn't as wild and crazy as I thought it would be. They should, as other reviewers said, allow hotel guest easier access to the roof top bars. You can get there but you have to go outside and line up on 13th street. That's weird. Same thing trying to get back to your room from the club at night. You have to go down outside and then go through the lobby. I guess they need to control access to the guest room floors but it is still a pain. Of course the location in the meat packing district is great. Lots of shops, restaurants and places to visit and not too far from midtown or Soho.There are a couple of criticisms that I have. The main counter/console in the room had wood veneer trim which was splitting and delaminating. They need to spend a little money on the furniture to keep it fresh. I also thought it was odd that the floor in the front dining room of the Standard Grill seemed pretty dirty. Maybe it is stained but it just doesn't look good at all. Clean or replace the floor.Overall lots of fun.","Bradenton, Florida",8,4.0

This Standard is geared more as a night club than a hotel. Even then, unless you intend to spend your time queuing, vogueing, being ignored by staff and partying in equal measure forget it. Guests rate last. Sleep, just above that. The receptionist told a guest checking in to an upper floor that it may be an issue if they were ""sensitive to noise"": good advice! Those with ears are better served elsewhere. We were on a slightly lower floor and I needed my noise cancelling earbuds for sleeping. On Saturday night, even they were beaten. The top floor bar is spectacular, although near impossible to access. Once inside, the glamorous wait staff will snub you unless they know you or you are more glamorous than them: the room was spoiled by the people in it. The Biergarten had a line which snaked around the corner. On the plus side the concierge staff were pleasant and helpful and the bikes were great if you got one. On check out, I queried a mini bar charge and was told there was no option but to charge it. When I asked about my promised F&B credit, I was told that could not be done although to compensate the receptionist gained the ability to revoke the minibar tab. This confirmed my view that the staff are trained to say no over yes, although they do look good doing it.",brisbane,6,2.0

We paid a premium for this room but I have to say it was worth it. The floor to ceiling windows gave a breathtaking view of the Highline Park and at night when the City lit up it seemed to come into the room. The bed was huge and was incredibly comfortable. The net curtains allow you to enjoy the views whilst providing privacy enough to get ready and the blackout curtains were extremely effective allowing a good night's sleep.The bath / shower room has shutters that close for privacy but you can open them once in the bath and discreetly enjoy the spectacular view.The hotel itself has an overall cool vibe which you will experience from the moment you pull up to it. The bell hops are are young trendily dressed people who are extremely welcoming, friendly and approachable.The Standard Hotel seems very popular with locals. The Le Bain and Top of The Standard club / bars seem to attract the local beautiful crowd but herein lies one small problem that you should be aware of. Although the TOTS / Le Bain are in the hotel, they seem to be owned managed by a third party. This means that being a resident of the hotel does not grant you any particular status. Also, until about 11pm it would appear that the main lobby / guest lifts are the entrance to Le Bain at the 18th floor. This means that you have to share (compete) with the Le Bain patrons when getting to your room. On more than one occasion we returned to the hotel after a long walk around a very hot and humid NYC only to be looked at by Le Bain patrons as if we were snot (in fairness, I did need a shower). At prime times you can be waiting quite a while for an elevator.Some mirrored doors are also moved around at night reducing the compliment of four elevators to two. The first night I experienced this I thought I had a little too much to drink but was re-assured by other equally puzzled faces.Every trip can come with glitches and problems and it is how these are resolved that is important. On our first day we experienced some difficulties with an issue I feel no need to go into any further however I want to note that the Duty Manager, the General Manager and the Front of House Manager were all very helpful. The Hotel Manager left some fresh fruit and Prosecco in our room by way of apology but more impressively the Front of House Manager went out of his way to meet with us to discuss our difficulties and he genuinely seemed interested in our opinion.I agree with Terry S's review; the Meatpacking District & Chelsea will have enough to entertain anyone from shopping to restaurants, nightlife and places to see so you won't have to travel far from the hotel.I will write a separate review on the Standard Grill which is really good and on a few of the restaurants we used on this trip.If you get the chance, stay here!","Belfast, United Kingdom",34,5.0

The check in staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome, the room was a good size, bathroom not for shy couples, good views over the Highline and Meatpacking District. We wanted to have a drink at sunset at the rooftop bar and was so put off by the snotty girl passing judgement on potential clientele. We had to provide a room key to prove that we were staying at the hotel, and was then asked for ID (we're in our mid thirties) and finally told that we could only go to the casual bar as tennis shoes are not allowed in the terrace (even though someone else with tennis shoes not staying at the hotel was ushered right through). Felt like we got the third degree while they're letting through their own friends. It was a real cool spot if you're into being seen (jacuzzi pool on the dance floor - really?!) - maybe a bit too cool for us. We just wanted some good music and have a drink watching the sunset. Finally, we were woken up by pumping base at 2am when our neighbours decided to throw a party - reception did send security up but it started up again soon after they left and continued till 5am.

Be sure to check out the bar and club on the higher floors (despite the infamous door policy at Le Bain, it's not as bad as everyone makes out), don't bypass the downstairs grill in the morning as the breakfast is amazing (the Huevos Rancheros was quality), and be sure to book in for Bingo on a Sunday night, it's a blast.What doesn't get mentioned in many reviews is just how great the customer service is. From the bellboys to the receptionists, everyone had advice on places to go, places to avoid, and we found the whole experience very welcoming. It definitely helped that there was a bottle of prosecco waiting for us when we checked into our room.This hotel is definitely geared towards a younger (or young at heart crowd), and if you're looking to have the whole Times Square/Empire State experience, then you will be better served booking elsewhere.

As for the room, the view was amazing, with floor-to-ceiling windows and the bed was super-comfy. Typical Standard minimalistic decor. The only other downfall was that the shower is open to the rest of the bathroom, which made for a mess trying to not splash water everywhere.

We did have a little trouble finding it as our cab driver from Newark airport didn't know it so make sure you have the address handy. The is no signage outside but look for the bright yellow revolving door and that is where your experience begins. The lobby area is very quirky and the staff enthusiastic and helpful. I wont spoil the surprise but the lifts were the strangest of experiences. We had asked for a high floor room overlooking the Hudson and were not disappointed. Although quite small it was beautifully presented, light and airy, especially with floor to ceiling windows to take in the spectacular views of the Freedom Tower, Statue of Liberty, the Highline and the river. Our bathtub was the biggest we have had anywhere but the toilet is a tight squeeze and wardrobe space limited. On arrival the weather was glorious so we made our way to the cocktail bar on the top floor and took our drinks up to the rooftop terrace. From there we could see the views that the rooms on the opposite side of the hotel had towards the Empire State Building. Everything here is very chic and the guests similarly presented. Food was brilliant in the hotel breakfast room but we didn't eat there in the evening so cannot comment on that. Be aware that the warnings you are given that the glass is transparent in your room are true. I found myself being waved to by workers down in the meat packing district wearing just my 2 towels one morning and people are walking the Highline from early morning to late evening ;) This is a lively part of the City and you will hear some noise, including the disco until some silly hour on Sunday morning but I never expect a good nights sleep on city breaks. There are lots of good restaurants, bars and designer shops within very short walking distances and we found the Chelsea Markets in the former Nabisco factory really interesting with a massive range of food outlets. I would recommend this hotel for a few reasons; it's location, views, quirkiness, quality etc although it isn't cheap. Oh yes just one last thing, if you forget anything it will almost lay certainly be available in the mini bar that was almost as well stocked as Tesco ;)","Mansfield, Nottinghamshire",55,5.0

The service levels have decreased to a standard that is terrible. Notwithstanding the fight to get to your room due to all the bridge and tunnel people trying to get to the top floor bar.So imagine going back to your hotel room and finding not only is there someone else in your room, but all your clothes, valuables and personal items have been removed!!! This is exactly what happened to me on Monday at THE STANDARD HIGHLINE NEW YORK. Excuse was that someone checked me out of my room even though my reservation was for 2 other days. They didn't bother to contact me, even though they had all my contact details and just thought I wasn't coming back so cleared everything out and dumped everything in my suitcase! Dumped being the operative word - my dry cleaners are having a good week sorting this out. I say everything, but things also went missing. No real apologies, albeit I refused to pay the bill and got a room for the night. A real violation as far as I'm concerned. So my advise to you is DON'T STAY there!

I have felt the need to write my first review on Tripadvisor because i was so underwhelmed with this hotel. I don't want people to think that we are always so negative so please look at Heidi Wade's reviews for a more balanced overview of other hotel stays. The positives- 1. Our Deluxe King Room faced the water and had nice views. 2. Tim the concierge was great and very helpful.The negatives- This hotel caters for the night club / bar on the upper floors and the restaurant / bar on the ground floor. On the Friday and Saturday nights the queue for the elevator to get to our room was outside the hotel front door. Roughly 30-40 meters. On one occassion i had to wait 22 minutes to get from my room on the 7th floor to the reception on ground floor. 22 minutes!!!!! To serve all floors of the hotel / bars and night clubs it was 4 elevators. Later in the evenings the elevators are reduced to two elevators for hotel guests. I have travelled all around the world and never experienced this. There is absolutely no where to relax in this hotel other than your room. You have to queue for tables / seats in the bar area on ground floor. Don't plan on relaxing on the roof terrace in the sun. People were lying on the artificial grass with zero space to sit. No hotel toilets on ground floor. Two toilets for the whole bar / restaurant area equalled big queues. Complete joke. There is no personal service to hotel guests. You are made to feel like an add on to everything else going on.,"London, United Kingdom",22,1.0

They're all going to the roof-top bar, which in 8 days of staying there, we never saw because it was either closed or so packed full of previously described people and bouncers that it wasn't really worth the effort for two 30-year olds with self-confidence to deal with. Also, said club was playing super loud music that was so loud that we could hear it clearly on the 11th floor (of an 18 floor building) until 4am. But, the hotel proactively provided ear plugs, so I'm sure they had no idea how annoying this is to every guest who stays there....I stayed here for 8 days with my fiance while we were in New York on business. The novelty of this crowded spot in the Meatpacking district wore off in about the first 5 minutes when it became clear that the huge crowds didn't have to do with quality - they had to do with being seen. We waited 45 minutes to eat brunch at the restaurant downstairs where they served us an eggo waffle (described as ""belgian"" - clearly they have not been to Belgium) and a ""tomato gratin"" which was a soggy tomato on toast. It was unquestionably the worst food that we had in New York in 8 days and was worse than any brunch we have ever eaten at any restaurant in San Francisco. But, at least the bill was $78. Now our friends will know that we are rich and stupid enough to go there. That is, as far as I can tell, the point of doing anything at the Standard.A few other points:1) the view is great but the rooms are TINY (and I have stayed at A LOT of European hotels). They are also not private at all (as you are warned by the management in an explicit letter upon arrival), and so because your bed is up against the window that allows anyone on the high line or in the office building across the street to see you, if you want to have any privacy at all, you need to close the curtains, thus removing the benefit of the view while simultaneously underscoring exactly how tiny the room is.2) We had a flight out from JFK at 4pm on Sunday - Gay pride parade sunday. Knowing that this could be a problem, when we checked out at 11 we asked them what we needed to do to get to the airport on time. They smiled and said ""we'll call you a taxi whenever you want it."" NOTHING about the fact that half the streets in Manhattan were about to CLOSE, including THE ONE THAT THE STANDARD WAS ON!!! When we realized what was going on about two hours later when we saw the streets closing we ran back to the hotel in a panic. It then took us 2.5 hours of the most harrowing taxi ride EVER to get to the airport and we almost missed our flight. If you have an explicit conversation about getting to the airport on time and the hotel is calling you a taxi (which they also didn't do, instead they handed us to a hawking taxi driver who was lurking out front with a broken meter, fishing for airport transfers who would pay the fixed rate), then it is any reasonable hotel's responsibility to tell you that their hotel is on a closed street and PS it will take 2 extra hours to get to the airport. 3) They force you to donate money to the high line unless you read fine print and opt out. I love the high line and am happy to donate my own money to it in my own time in my own way, but this place that is clearly 100% dependent on the high line for its trend value shouldn't pretend that there is a positive motive, when clearly it is in their financial best interest to force guests to donate to the primary feature that makes this hotel worth something.4) The air con in the fitness room wasn't working properly, making it useless in NY when it's 93 degrees outside. Another example of how it looks good, but doesn't actually work.Overall, this hotel's priority is clearly its marketing that keeps its bar full of wannabe drunk fashionistas. I recommend staying at a hotel where the guests are the top priority.",Singapore/San Francisco,149,2.0

Straddled the high line, with its LA vibe and exhibitionist temptation, it is high on the cool factor. The view from the room and the roof is great. We loved it for that.But...we experienced very noisy guests on our floor in and out all night until 4am. Maybe the hotel has a reputation of hard party, but we should have guessed that the moment we saw a pair of complimentary ear plugs in the bathroom. The loud noises, which to be fair, may not be within the hotel's control, but a hot-spot roof bar that opens to public until 4am may kind of guarantee that. The bed and pillows are very very soft which may not be perfect for people who are used to firmer sleeping arrangement like us. So as a result, we got very little sleep.The real issue, however, is the slow service we experienced at the front desk. With many people check in and out, it seems the hotel is extremely understaffed, with one person working the front desk on Saturday. Valet is very slow, check in is slow, getting out luggage from storage took close to 30 minutes.

Overall, it's a wonderful hotel but there a few downsides to being popular. It's often very hard to get down to the lobby or up to your hotel room because there are throngs of people crowding the elevator lobby waiting to get to the rooftop bar. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't manage this situation well. At other hotels with a trendy rooftop scene, such as Ink48, there is a separate elevator - staffed with bouncers - for those wishing to visit the rooftop. The other problem we experienced is that the free Wi-Fi offered by the hotel simply does not work. You can connect, but data transfer is so slow as to be useless. We stayed at The Standard for three nights and the Wi-Fi was hopelessly slow the entire time.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",52,4.0

My girlfriend and I eagerly anticipated our stay at this property, and in the popular Meatpacking District on a long summer weekend. We were not disappointed by the energy of the neighborhood. The Standard seemed like the epicenter of the action, and the property was absolutely teeming with people all day long. We had no problem with this activity. In fact, it was exciting to be part of the buzz, as we enjoyed The Standard Grill and rooftop clubs. And, The Standard’s location above the Highline is unmatched. Our room was comfortable, if somewhat small. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. We had some disappointments, though. First, the health club was absolutely untended. The exercise room itself was boiling, and amenities like ice water would have been welcomed, and frankly, expected. Second, in our room’s bathroom, there were shampoo and body wash products bolted to the wall by the shower. I understand the economizing nature taken, however, it was very difficult to extract this product when pumping, due to the way the products were bolted to the way. Frankly, when you are spending more than $500/night for a room, you don’t expect this kind of penny pinching. Disappointing.","Chicago, Illinois",99,3.0

Perhaps so much so that they are spreading themselves a little too thin and finding ways to make stays here a little bit more special.As a boutique, chic or whatever you want to call it hotel, TSH makes no small emphasis that it is a 'stand out from crowd' hotel. One that is HIP or at least different from say a commercial one with the typical luxurious amenities. Given that the modern traveler would probably dismiss amenities anyway but bear in mind, there are also other essentials that the discerning traveler too looks for.What TSH does so well, also spoils the experience for the hotel guests. And as a guest, you will be easily forgiven to think that they are first a hangout place and second a hotel. While the design is rather cool (the public areas that is) and they did a good job maintaning the essence of the Grill and the rest of the older parts of the establishment, the lobby itself though is way too small for the number of poseur guests wanting to lounge around the blue padded sofas. There is so much packed into the design for to create such a cool environment that they somehow forgotted that pizzazz the minute you step out of the groovy elevator into the corridors that lead to the rooms. And that is exactly when you realised 'I have been duped!'.The lack of glam and detail was evident the minute you step into the room too. Sure, the retro inspired style was cool when it first started, but it is now retro drab. It was of course comfortable enough but surely couldn't there be more given the first impression of the lobby areas? And to top it all off, the shower water pressure was so weak and I suspect it was done deliberately so that water doesn't splash out of the doorless shower cubicle. The flow of the hotel isn't that updated either. Some clown obviously didn't expect the success of their swanky bar on the top floor thus leaving hotel guests to jostle with the weekend party crowd. Sure it was nice and all (to see and be seen) but it would have been better to be given priority to us as a hotel guest given that we paid more per night than anyone could every drink. Seriously, hasn't anybody heard of private lifts? Not only did we have to squeeze in with the eager crowd, we had to also share the lift with a young drunkard clown on the way down.The restaurant areas are fabulous. The food is great and they do know how to run a bar. No complains whatsoever with their F&B at all since they seem to give a lot of priority to eating drinking guests to begin with. In fact, the staff are all cool from the reception to the door men. No fuss whatsoever. But don't expect them to initiate any service. You'd first have to ask before anything else happens. I mean for god's sake, it was raining and I had to ask for an umbrella?I guess TSH has yet to mature as a top class 'boutique-ish' hotel. The level of mix feelings you get staying here will be enough to shun you away from recurring visits. There are better hotels out there that would give you more attention for a lot less. Mind you, if you want to run a hotel, you would have to first understand the needs of the traveler first, to provide a stay better than home itself and not a watering hole and restaurant away from home. If you were to go through the various reviews here, you would surely realise those that sing its praises are party guests, not hotel ones.","Singapore, null, Singapore",15,1.0

Not to mention the West Village is classy and quiet, which is sorta better for a home base. 2) ""The douchebags fill the elevator on weekends to get to the club."" I mean, try telling people how awful it was that a gaggle of six minimally dressed, obvious bachelorettes, crowded in on your elevator. It's a funny story, not a downside.

Our general wait time at the elevators was 20 minutes due to the high volume of non-guests wanting to go to the rooftop bar. Security is a joke. You need your room key to access your floor but not the rooftop bar. Eventually they will be sued and then they will wake up and change this. At any time, I could have been followed off the elevator and attacked. The one night we made it into the rooftop bar, we waited 45 minutes for our drinks. We never made it into the beer garden or outside dining area as both were always packed and there were long lines.By Sunday morning checkout, only one elevator was working. We were told that there was so much people volume over the weekend that they were down from over use. If you are young and single, this is the hotel (nightclub) for you!

But staying on the high line in Chelsea/Meat Packing area was a really nice change. The rate was $350/night which in any other city would be a bit of a rip off; but in NYC in the summer it actually seemed like a good deal (the Ace was $550 a night for the same weekend). I found the hotel staff surprisingly nice and friendly. They even let us check in after an early morning flight which we really appreciated. The exception was the rooftop experience - the hostesses manning the doors were snotty, the prices were insane ($26 for a so so glass of wine is Standard in NYC but it felt excessive, and the wine wasn't great); that was the one disappointment of our stay. Loved the film in the elevator and the lush cafe/beer garden outside. Views were lovely and big tub was a plus. Encourage visitors to walk everywhere possible from the high line - and Chelsea Market being close was also an advantage. Overall, would recommend it and stay here again.","Winston Salem, North Carolina",22,4.0

The communal areas are good although I didn't think the bar area was all that. Having said that we ate in the Grill one night which had a great menu and was really buzzing. The Meatpacking district might not be everyone's cup of tea but we really liked it and it's a great neighbourhood to wander around finding coffee shops and bars.

Still in pretty good condition though, given they're a few years old now. No signs of wear that we spotted.People often cite problems with the staff.

It's super cool and trendy and full of ""beautiful people"", which might intimidate the average tourist (we just laughed!). The reception staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was fairly small (we stayed in a deluxe king) but it is NYC and so you expect small rooms. Don't stay here unless you're very comfortable with your room-mate: the shower / tub is separated from the bed by a clear screen, so you're showering in the open!!! The toilet is in a tiny separate room. There is a lot of street noise but again it's NYC. We weren't bothered by noise from the club, but we had made sure we were on the other side of the hotel from it. Our view was great - Empire State Building and the Hudson. One night we suffered with some pretty noisy neighbours and had to make a couple of phone calls to reception - however to be fair that's not the hotel's fault and they dealt with it. Suspect it happens a lot tho, especially at weekends, since it is a bit of a party hotel. One negative is the elevators - there are four but who knows where they all are, because we had to wait for ages and only one seemed to turn up. There's a funky film showing in the elevator, but to be honest you'd rather they didn't bother and just made them turn up. Sometimes there was a huge queue to get in them, and on the way down from the 16th floor we'd stop at every floor (grrrr....)Overall it's a good hotel, but perhaps a bit too style over substance for us.

Michael met us as we pulled up in a cab asking about our luggage. I was skeptical about this stranger on the street taking my luggage (they dress rather casually) but Michael quickly reassured me that he was legit (2 legit..). He lead us in, gave use some great pointers and helped us start the early bag drop check in. His service never slept as he overhead that it was our 8yr anniversary and that we were from ATL, thus he left a bottle of fancy water and a few peaches in our room. Dude was slick, but when he wasn't around we got great help from Joel H. and Paul A., both of which lead us to some tasty lunches/dinners. Of them all, Joel went above and beyond and personally showed us around the hotel, introduced us to other cool people, dropped surprises off at our room and consoled us when we cried about the lack of hotel guest accommodations during the rooftop activities. The staff there quickly went from being Standard employees to NYC friends. Tim helped us depart despite us not wanting to go, leaving us to dream about our next Standard trip. If ya'll make it down to ATL, come by the Estate once it's done and we'll show you around.The Goods:- Staff is extremely, extremely accommodating, welcoming and ready to point you in a good direction (Be nice to them, they deserve it and will reciprocate!)- The location was great, central to good food, easy to get cabs and now really close to CityBikes- Right on The High Line...UNDER the hotel. Great walk / jogging path too along the Hudson- The hotel was immaculate- Very nice work out room overlooking the Hudson but I have NO clue how to use that machine near the free weights. Looked to be something out of Tron...- Window view to downtown was amazing. The Uglies:- When it is rooftop club time it gets rather hectic with everyone trying to get to the roof despite not being able to through the hotel elevators. Rather annoying- No way for hotel patrons to get to the roof without having to EXIT the hotel, get in line with the overly tanned buff dudes and daisy dukes- There needs to be a hotel patron only part of the club...I WOULD HAVE PAID MORE FOR THAT!!That's it.

This place is great in rainy or cold months because there's a roof-top club and a ground-floor beer garden that generate noise into the wee-hours in the summer months. It doesn't matter which way you face during the out-door months because there will be club music and people having a good time (even on weekday nights) until at least 2am. I've stayed here on a rainy weekend in October, and I've stayed here for a week during which it both rained and had beautiful weather in June -- and I'm positive that the weather outside influences the comfort of my stay! On the rainy nights, it was super quiet and we slept really well. On the nice nights, we just didn't sleep due to the club/party noise. Sidebar: They do provide nice ear plugs in the bathroom, and now I know why...Next, the wi-fi was abysmally slow. I haven't seen wi-fi this slow in 10 years, it's like dial-up speeds. The wifi is provided by DoCoMo (the Japanese state telecom) and I swear, the internet was so slow, I could totally believe that the server was located *in* Japan. I did a speed test and got 200kbps down and 350 kbps down on the free version. Even if you pay the extra $20 a day for faster internet, it's still capped at 6mb/sec, which is too slow to stream. We finally resorted to unplugging the house phone (which uses a cat5 cable, VOIP system) and plugging that into the ethernet port on my computer. Only then did we get ""normal"" 2013 speed internet. Btw, the wired internet is free (we called the front desk to check). Due to the noise issues, we were moved from a standard queen to a deluxe king. Biggest difference in the rooms (aside from the bed size)? The deluxe king had the shower in the tub = no more floods! The standard queen had the shower in a stall that was flush with the floor of the rest of the bathroom (also, without any partition or shower curtain) so every time you showered, you flooded the bathroom and had to have towels strategically placed to catch the flood before you slipped. Other than these issues, we loved The Standard. The bubble bath is really great, as is the giant soaking tub! The beds were super comfy, the linens were crisp, the service was excellent, the HVAC worked and was quiet (it's a newer building), and the coffee table is super cool (it goes up and down so it's like having a coffee table and a desk in one). NB: There is no in-room coffee maker (this place is too cool for that), but Chelsea Market is just 2 blocks away.So I would definitely recommend The Standard during the fall, winter, and early spring. But I'd avoid it in the late spring, summer, and early autumn -- the noise from the nearby outdoor clubs means that you're not going to sleep well.","San Francisco, California",103,3.0

After much checking, we decided to go to the Standard High Line. To be honest, we chose it more because it sits above the High Line Park, than for its reputation as a hip hotel. We booked a one-night, two-days stay, and took the subway to get there. Now, maybe because we are not that ""hip"" we walked to the address, looking for a sign with the hotel's name, we didn't see any. We saw this revolving door at this building on Washington and West 13th Streets and went in, again, no signs. So we asked one of the persons at this small reception area, where was the Standard High Line hotel, and in his snobbiest voice told us ""you are standing in it"", well then...We checked-in. We had asked for, and received, one of the higher-up floors. We were very impressed by the decor, it was very modern, and urban. The elevator ride was an event in itself, as they have two screens showing a wild show and music. Our room left us amazed. It was elegant and well-arranged,. The layout was interesting to say the least, with a transparent shower room between the lavatory and the bed, a sitting area, and floor-to-ceiling windows that gave us a phenomenal view of the city's skyline. We went to the top floor to check out the penthouse discotheque and found it very lively. The restaurants were OK. The only complaint that we had was that we found no toiletries supply, you know the soap, etc, but after we called, they brought them. The other matter was that we had to request non-feathers pillows, due to allergies, as when we booked, there was no place to put that request in. We told the hotel concierge that maybe they should correct that. Overall we liked the hotel. Also, we had the most amazing views of the city and the area. The concierge also was great offering advice on what to do, where to eat & what to see in the area. The only thing -- it's not cheap, even with a discount, we paid quite a bit.

No sneakers allowed! It closes to everyone except members after 10.30. There is another (very loud) bar at the other end of the top floor, so don't get the two confused. Make sure you book if you want to sit at a table (you use be seated by the staff to be served at the tables).

Such a contradiction. On the one hand, it's extraordinary: Above the 8th floor, the views of the Hudson River opening into the Atlantic are lovely. From your bed, shower or tub you can see the evening skyline lit like a necklace of burning diamonds. The top floor bar is staggeringly beautiful. The staff are fantabulously good looking. The clientele is hipster on steroids. When my husband and I checked in for a stay-cation this past weekend, we were booked in a Hudson Studio, but as Tablet Plus members, we were entitled to an upgrade. Our second night, when they had availability, they upgraded us to one of four suites in the hotel.On the other hand, a few other things went on that were less than, well, standard. For one, we'd put a Do Not Disturb on our phone (and our door). Consider our surprise when we received a wake up call at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday morning. Or, consider the WiFi, which we upgraded to the faster level of speed for the ridiculous $20 extra. It was STILL unusably slow. Finally after spending more time on the phone with the IT folks than with each other, we gave up and went without. Then there was the newspaper. For some reason, despite our asking for it the night before, it didn't come until after we called TWICE. Oh, yeah, and breakfast. We ordered oatmeal, but we didn't want cream and raison compote. We just wanted it with skim milk. Emphasized this twice. It arrived made with water. We left it at that. Finally, we did go up to the Top of the Standard, but my better half was wearing sneakers. They sized him up and said, okay those are cool kicks, you can come in. We go in, and just as we're about to snag a seat at the bar, a flustered hostess in a satin dress chases us down and says she's changed her mind and we can't go in. It was hilarious. If you're looking for a hotel experience with a view, there are other better choices at the same price point--the Mandarin Oriental, but it's on Columbus Circle and sits atop a shopping mall. There's the Four Seasons, with its far better view of the city and Central Park, but it's on the staid Upper East Side. Yet meatpacking where the Standard High Line is, actually may be hip to foreigners but to NYers it's more of a New Jersey hot spot. And we saw more people from Jersey at the Top of the Standard than from Hong Kong or Berlin. For sheer beauty, flawless service, expensive but worth it experience, I'd recommend the Meadow Suite at the Crosby Street Hotel in SoHo. I know, SoHo has too many suburban mall shops, but at least when you're inside the Crosby you don't know that at all.","New York City, New York",46,3.0

From reading other reviews we thought it might be a bit too cool for school and it certainly lived up to this. The room was bright and modern with awesome views and mega comfy bed, but it was a little tired around the edges. It was also a bit on the small side - we travelled pretty light which was just as well as there isn't anywhere to put your bag and only a small closet to hang clothes in. Great bath and shower but this is all open plan so make sure you know your travelling companion well, otherwise you will by the time you leave (at least the toilet was hidden away in a cupboard). Hotel staff were friendly and co-operative, but the service was a bit more surly at the bar. Just because you're paying a premium for a hotel room apparently doesn't get you any privileges (or even particularly polite service) at the bar. That said, the Top of the Standard is a pretty special bar with those views and great cocktails and worth facing the risk of rejection by the door staff. Didn't try Le Bain, but heard good things about it (and the bass from our room...). The German beer garden's a bit more relaxed, but fun and worth a visit.","Newport, United Kingdom",31,4.0

""Just wait till you see them,"" my girlfriend said on the cab ride there, ""They're on the top floor and you can see right across New York!""Following a bamboozling check-in process (The Standard is too trendy for normal entrances or signs), the bellboy showed us up to our room, which was a little, erm, sordid. Condoms were neatly presented on the side table and a bath-for-two sat beside an open wooden slat arrangement - which itself sat beside enormous room-height windows. The views! We're talking serious wow factor - from the end of my bed all of Lower Manhattan could be seen, from Brooklyn Bridge via the World Trade Center and out towards the Statue of Liberty.Rather than settle into our room, we headed upstairs to the rooftop cocktail bar - a space that straddles inside and out, where discerning Slippery Bald Beaver-sippers gawp at 360-degree views of New York and talk rhinoplasty in between pouting for Instagram photos. At least that's what I had been told - first off, we had to make our way past the lady at the door and her doting bouncer.It was about 7pm. I was wearing a shirt and relatively tight jeans. My girlfriend was looking as wonderful as ever. But my attire seemingly counted for nothing. ""We're full,"" the door lady said, looking at me up and down. ""But it's 7,"" I replied. Hold on a minute - look at the state of me! Who did I think I was? Someone with the right to reply? I was not worthy Standard Hotel cocktail bar door lady; I was not worthy!Only I was, because we were spending hundreds of dollars for the privilege of staying there, something my other half happily explained after I had been put in my place, tail between my legs. The bouncer and I cast each other knowing glances; we knew what was about to erupt, so he went ahead and opened that door without further fuss.Expecting a bar rammed full of city slickers, we were somewhat underwhelmed by the presence of about 10 people, approximately seven of whom were, shall we say, well on their way while trying desperately, and failing pathetically, to preserve their dignity. I could see why the door lady didn't want to grant us entry, so to fit in a little better I took off my shirt, folded it neatly on a bar stool and started splashing around in the pool adjacent to the bar, remembering to take a 'selfie' every two minutes.But our reason for propping up this most pretentious of bars was not to indulge in the clientele's narcissism; no, it was to see the famed water closets. We glugged down whatever cocktail we were drinking and made our way to the unisex cubicles. ""See, I told you they were amazing,"" my girlfriend said. And they really were! Not the toilets per se, that would be odd, but the views from their windows. Midtown was sprawled in front and beneath us; the stunning view dominated by an illuminated Empire State Building. It kind of made the pretentiousness worth it. Would I stay here again? No, probably not - once was enough, thank you very much.","London, United Kingdom",15,3.0

Others may prefer a more subdued location with better access to the Subway and more attractions within walking distance. The views, however, are awesome from pretty much every room, enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows.There are, unfortunately, some problems: housekeeping was maddeningly uneven, never quite doing the same thing (after I call for an extra soap bar for the shower, the next day BOTH bars are removed from the bathroom...) and often slow in responding. The mini-ironing board was a poor joke -- I had to line it with towels to get a flat surface; the shallow closet and cheap toilet finishes reminded me of Lower East Side tenements; the public corridors look very institutional; the front desk seems permanently under-staffed; and the queen bed had only one side table and reading light.

There are a lot of aspects I love about this hotel, the discreet entrance, The Standard Grill, the view over the High Line, the location (Meat Packing) and a gym with a great view of the Empire State building...The Food here is good, both upstairs in the restaurant (great toilets, trust me) and also downstairs, you can have quick bites to eat, or serious main meals. From the minute you get to the Standard there is just a good vibe, and it makes staying in NYC feel like a fun experience, not too serious whilst also not trying too hard. The rooms are small-ish but by NYC standards you really do get what you pay for and space is not cheap.The design is 70s, the rooms carry the tone well, and the design works with the space you have. A large bath and shower give you a view out of the room, and onto the Hudson or alternatively give your partner a view of you...Location is spot on for this hotel, not far to SoHo at all, great shopping, bars, cafes, I love that part of Manhattan (Tribeca, Greenwich, Soho & Little Italy) and always try to stay in and around Meat Packing district on my visits... If your in two minds whether to stay here, you should, its fun, plenty to do, great area, and it's not Standard. If you're looking for something more traditional in the same area take a look at Soho Grand Hotel, or The Ganservoort.

We booked a suite and were allowed complimentary early check-in so I could get dressed in my wedding gown. My bridesmaids and I all got dressed there together, did our makeup, and my mother, mother-in-law, aunt, flower girls, and a friend all got ready in our suite together. My friend requested that the room be cleaned again after we had all gotten ready there, and by the time my husband and I returned in the evening post-wedding, it was spotless as if we had never stepped in the room. Also, we took pictures outside near the restaurant and the pictures of me and my friends hailing a cab to the wedding are some of my favorite wedding pictures. Even though the cabs around the hotel were off-duty when we needed one so we could all get to the wedding, the Standard staff made it happen and ensured we all had cabs. When returning at night post-wedding, the views of the city from our suite were incredible, and the windows are full length; one feels as if you are floating above the city. Although I am normally wary of taking baths in hotels, the bathtub was spotless and right next to a full-length window. How could we resist? Even though we live in the city we had wanted to stay in a hotel to commemorate our wedding, and this was the most romantic, perfect place to do so. We've been to the bar and Standard Grill on separate occasions (2013 and 2011, respectively) and enjoyed both of these experiences, as well. We loved our first experience so much, in fact, that my husband surprised me with a belated Valentine's Day stay at the Standard in February 2013. While we did not stay in a suite this time, we had a romantic, wonderful stay in a regular views with sweeping views of the Hudson River. Again, our room was clean, the bathroom polished, and we enjoyed our time, once again, at the Standard. In all, the Standard offers exceptional customer service, the staff is friendly and accommodating, the rooms are clean, and the hotel offers a memorable experience for its polished style, minimalist decor, and friendly atmosphere located in the heart of the Meatpacking District.

Newcomers might do well to note the address. Look not for words, but an impossibly bright yellow revolving door - that is the unmistakable indication that you have arrived.In some ways, the hotel feels like a fantasy: Undulating spongiform textures in the lobby; handsome, friendly and capable staff; stark, semi-industrial design with a 'wink'. Marco Brambilla's video art in the elevators is worth mentioning here: intricate, dizzying apocalyptic moving collages showing something in between religious ecstasy and high camp -- kind of a pop version of Dante's inferno. All of these elements collide to create a surprisingly pleasant atmosphere that is perfect for couples and lovers.The rooms are fairly generous by New York standards, and what's more they are very functional: mine had a table with seating for 4 in addition to a bed, separate toilet, shower, and very large soaking tub. The shampoo, soap and lotion are high quality and beautifully fragrant, and the minibar is extremely well stocked. Overall, the room design & furnishing feels a bit like you're on board James Bond's yacht off the coast of Monaco, circa 1979 (in a good way.)Ok but now for the part about modesty: It cannot be overlooked that the walls are nothing but enormous floor-to-ceiling windows on all sides. Yes, they give on to sweeping views of Manhattan, but they also quite plainly put you on display for every tourist walking the High Line. Adding to this feeling of being overexposed is the shower / soaking tub, which sits smack in the middle of the room surrounded by nothing but 3 transparent walls of glass.

Its location, in the low-rise Meat Packing district, means that every room is afforded a great view, and the views from the higher floors are quite stunning. Our advice is to ask for a river rather than city view as the southerly aspect is the best, and provides a view of the downtown skyline as well as the Hudson. The rooms are well designed to maximise the view, with floor to ceiling windows and a design which creates a sense of space in what are average sized rooms. Standing at the window you quickly realise you are on display to all of New York, and the hotel staff gently remind you that this is particularly the case if you aren't wearing clothes!We enjoyed the Standard but probably wouldn’t return despite the view. As a hotel the Standard seems to lack a soul. We were so disappointment when we arrived home at 10pm on the first night looking forward to cocktails in the bar on the top floor, only to be told it wasn’t available to hotel guests, it was closed most evenings after about 8pm for private functions. It’s a rare hotel that provides fewer amenities for guests than for casual visitors‼ The steady stream of people heading up to the bar reinforced the sense that the hotel is a public place rather than a 'private' hotel. We also felt a bit cheated in regard to internet access – it’s ‘free’ but at a room rate of $400/night, having to renew our access every day for four days on every device we carried (computer, iphone and ipad) was a stupid pain in the neck, and the kind of petty annoyance that when you’re paying a lot of money does not feel like ‘customer service’. On the other hand, the bellhops were unfailingly cheery and helpful with advice, taxis etc.It’s a tradeoff. It's not a cheap hotel, and you share it with the bar hoppers of New York, but it is an excellent location, and when you sit in your room and stare out at the amazing view, or walk out of the hotel onto the marvellous Highline, you truly feel part of the Big Apple. Walking on the Highline early on a cold sunny spring morning, watching the city wake up around us, is one of our abiding memories of New York.",Canberra,78,4.0

If you haven't seen, the rooms are so small, you literally need to go outside to change your mind! The beds are VERY low, actually on the floor. So it's like doing squats to get out of the bed. The shower is actually part of the bathroom and water gets EVERYWHERE. So you have to use a bath towel for the floor b/c the bathmat is too small. It's a trendy hotel and always full. The rooms aren't quiet at all. You can hear people in the hallways louder than normal.I think the team there is professional and courteous. Never had an issue. They've always been very accommodating and attentive. It's a pricy hotel, but you'd expect that in NYC.","Miami Shores, Florida",93,3.0

I decided to give it a try.First impressions: The entrance is through a yellow archway and a revolving door. It's not labeled with the hotel name. Just look for the crowd of hipsters standing out front, and you'll find it.The room:I had one of the smaller rooms. It's typical size for a Manhattan boutique hotel, so not bad. The bathroom is small, with a single sink that looks like they picked it up at Ikea. The tub is a massive soaking tub. The long wall of the tub/shower is all glass, and gives you a view of the TV, and the city. As a result, great views, but don't have a guest in the room while someone is using the shower or tub, unless you don't mind giving them a show. The rain-style shower head is nice.The bed is large, and of medium firmness. Four pillows were provided. It sits low on the floor, so if you are older, or would have trouble getting up off the floor, this isn't the hotel for you. There was a small sitting area, with room for three people, and a small table right by the window. The view is one of the selling points of this hotel, and the view from my room was good (12th floor). The windows are floor-to-ceiling, full length of the wall. The flooring by the window buckled a bit when I walked up to the window. Not very reassuring. The TV was a flat panel type, but picture quality for some channels was poor. It seemed that they were using some kind of TV over IP system, and the result is that some channels (BBC America, for example) actually froze, or became pixelated, like watching bad web video. The closet wasn't really a closet. It was more like a small set of shelves, with a clothing hook with some hangars, and a curtain to pull over it all. Probably the worst feature of the room. Hopefully, the bigger rooms have more space. If you are just here for a couple nights, it's probably fine, but annoying if you were staying longer.The overall condition of the room was decent, but a bit worn. The door security latch was just hanging on by some backed-out screws, and the door didn't really latch properly unless you slammed it. I thought it might just be my room, but I watched one of my neighbors struggle with his door as well.The soundproofing on the room is okay, but not great. Even on the 12th floor, a fair amount of street noise. Not unusual in this part of town. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs.WiFi is offered in two forms: ""Free"", which is slower than the data connection on a recent model smart phone, and $20/day for ""fast"" WiFi, which in the evenings at least, is also fairly slow, delivering a measured 3 Mbit down, 1.5 Mbit up. Your mileage may vary, of course. Why do hotels think it's okay to charge you for WiFi service that delivers a tiny fraction of the performance of most home broadband connections?Room Service:Menu is a bit limited, and the dinner choices didn't particularly appeal to me. The food was delivered in the time promised, but quality wasn't great. Probably best just to use room service for breakfast, rather than dinner. Besides, there are tons of great restaurants within walking distance. Eating room service for dinner here really should be your last resort.Gym:The gym, located on the 17th floor, has some amazing views of the river, and downtown. Free weights (dumbbells), treadmills, and some stationary bikes are provided, along with yoga mats and balance balls. They also had a few fixed weight machines, but not much. Still, not bad for a hotel gym, but nothing really fancy.The Staff:Everyone I dealt with (front desk, room service, housekeeping) was very polite, professional, and friendly. Summary:It's not a bad place at all, but the web site makes it look more upscale than it is. If you want a decent, trendy, modern-ish hotel for a reasonable price, The Standard does the job. If you are looking for high-quality room service, better room furnishings in the same location, check out the Gansevoort a few blocks away.","San Jose, California",8,3.0

This is a great hotel with good facilities that all come at a robust cost. Hanging out in this part of town takes coin. The Internet is OK. It's not super fast but it's fine for email and web browsing. The buzz is great and you feel it when you hang out around the downstairs bar. The rooms are comfortable with great views and comfy beds. My challenge to the management is this. Do you run The Standard for your hotel guests or for the ad hoc visitors that pop in for a social reason? More and more it is my feeling that the entire operation prioritises the latter. The facilities, which hotel guests pay handsomely to avail of, are not exclusive. You have to fight for restaurant tables and sunset seats. You have to queue on the street to gain access to the Boom Boom rooms, despite the fact that this is your hotel! You don't even get handed to the top of the queue for priority entry. You get to stand on a side street with everyone else.All of the priorities and privileges that should be afforded hotel guests are over-looked at The Standard. You don't cherish your hotel clientele. And over time, we will start to drift off to other places. The reason you have hotel facilities is to entice and retain hotel guests. The whole point of shelling out $lots a night for an exclusive hotel is so you feel exclusive. Neither of these two paradigms are upheld at The Standard and it will start to tell soon enough. I'm good with paying a high price for an exclusive, luxury experience. But The Standard experience isn't feeling much like either at the moment. I hope you heed this free and well-intended feedback.","London, United Kingdom",86,4.0

It wasn't perfect though. The rooms are TINY and the some of the furnishings looks a little worn and cheap looking, so you don't feel you are in a great hotel when you are in room.

And the high-line / meatpacking-district still a hot-spot. Sort of. The Grill is great and Boom Boom-room/Le Bain continues to draw crowds. You will feel a slight rush when joining the party crowd - of tourists, alas. Because The Standard is now more famous than exciting. O.K with that and you will have a good time partying your socks off. The room ( I lived in a Deluxe Queen ) had seen better days. The devil lies in details... like the the loose shower handle and the shabby wall-to-wall carpet. On a good day the minor errors are shadowed by the great view that most rooms come with. My general feeling is that everything that is really good about the Standard, has to do with non-hotel-realated stuff: the bars, the restaurant, the high-line access and skating track (winter time obviously). It is certainly not good for working purposes, but hey, that's my mistake. The Standard is mostly about party, with that unmistakable feeling that the V.I.P guests left a long time ago.

Rising above the High Line and the West Side Highway, in the center of the meatpacking district, this hotel has already become a mainstay of the iconic New York City skyline. And, for now at least, its novelty and location will ensure that your stay in NYC will be a fashionable one. You will pay a high price to stay at this hotel but for now it is worth it. You will want a water view (South side of hotel). The rooms are small and are not for the nude shy (there is no door separating the shower from the room - there is a door to the toilet). The rooftop bar is not to be missed. The High Line is also not to be missed (although it is better in the Spring and Fall). Room service is available 24 hours. But do not expect a top of the line luxury experience. There is little traditional elegance here which will likely lead it to be outmoded at some point. The hotel has a minimalist 1960's Scandinavian decor. The carpets and couches in the room looked Ikeaesque, but were clearly the higher end versions that Ikea seeks to emulate. My advice is that if you are trying to get the best value for your money (assuming you are willing to spend over $500 a night in the first place) then stay elsewhere (like the St. Regis), but if you are instead looking to buy access to a hip and fun experience than stay here.","New York City, New York",46,4.0

I stayed here for a weekend with my boyfriend in early March 2013. I had asked for a room on a lower level, away from the rooftop bar/lounge, and they astutely adhered to my request, and even mentioned that it was far far away from the elevators. Awesome news upon check-in. The decor of the hotel is the first thing that will strike you. It is beautiful, stylishly designed, and my Standard King room was very clean. The beds here were really comfortable, and we slept very well. We went to the rooftop bar/lounge also, and it had an amazing view of the Hudson, and was also very stylishly designed. The hostess did say that it was mandatory for all guests to check their coats before entering the bar, though. Also, ""non-members"" (another phrase for ""preferred guests""?) were only allowed to enter before 9 PM. The amenities could be the best or worst part depending on your level of self-control and self-appointed budget. They're presented very lavishly in a cabinet in your room, and it's really hard to not just grab and open up everything you see. I think we went through 2 half-bottles of wine for the 3 days we stayed there only because we were conscious about how much we were actually spending. We really controlled ourselves on the snacks and non-alcoholic beverages as well, only opening a few of them when the cravings struck, but these allowances certainly made us feel very comfortable. I must note that the windows of the rooms are very visible to people outside, and one should certainly think twice before venturing too close to them if you just recently came out of the shower (which is only divided by a glass wall) or just wanted to feel liberal and undress yourself in front of them. Perhaps the hotel should think about tinting those...The only qualm we had with the hotel was of its appliances. The mini-fridge door in our room kept falling off, and we tried to pivot it back in place every time we opened/closed it. So though the fridge itself is closed, the cupboard door outside was hanging off. Also, one of the electrical sockets was coming loose. We had also requested a DVD player for our TV, but it turns out that they had low inventory on those, and it took around 4 hours, and a couple of (very polite) phone calls to finally receive this device. They were certainly very apologetic about our wait, though. But afterward, when we were operating it, some of the buttons didn't work, so we weren't able to watch our DVD in its entirety.

There is not complimentary water in the rooms, and forget about getting into the Hotel bar on the rooftop at night - they rudely told me that hotel guests only get in before a certain time (I think it was 9 or 10), and otherwise you have to 'be on a list'.

While our trip to New York was great, our stay at the hotel was marred by what I consider to be terrible customer service from a property that charges so much per night. Upon our arrival, our room was not available until two hours past the check in time. According to the front desk, the room had failed its initial inspection and had to be re-cleaned. I can’t be sure if this was true or not, just what I was told. Later, upon checking out, we asked our front desk concierge if we would be charged extra for leaving our car with the valet for a couple of hours, or if we would pay just the overnight rate of $55. We were told that it would be fine and just to have the valet bring the car up when we were done having lunch and shopping. We did just that, only to discover a few days later that we had been charged for 2 days. When I called to inquire about the charge, the manager on duty offered excuses (the lot is operated by a separate company and they can’t refund the money), some denial (the front desk staff would never tell us that because they had been trained on the parking policies by the managers), and finally just dumped me off on someone that would never pick up the phone (specifically the Standard Hotels accounting department). While I understand that sometimes refunding can be tricky, there was no reason that a complimentary upgrade or other measure of compassion couldn’t be offered. Instead, I was made to feel as if it was my word against the hotels, with the hotel making the assumption that I would make all of this up to get back $55 after paying over $200 for a one night stay. My recommendation to any travelers is use AirBnB or stay at a Starwood Hotel. I will be canceling my already scheduled stay in the Miami Standard as well.","Baltimore, Maryland",4,2.0

We live in both NYC and Miami Beach, travel frequently and were staying at the Standard as we get our new apartment buttoned down.I had never stayed at The Standard, or ventured inside. Since its arrival in the city my husband and I have been primarily living in Miami and traveling. The Standard brand has a good reputation, and we enjoyed the one in Los Angeles, and have been many times to the Standard in Miami, so I had relatively high expectations – some of which were met, and some not.The neighborhood of course, is amazing. Restaurants, shopping, convenient to subways to anywhere you might want to go. Although it was bitterly cold when we were there, access to the High Line Park from the Standard was a positive.The Hotel itself is oddly underwhelming. It feels like it should be exceptional… it wants to be exceptional – but it isn’t. The lobby is sleek (and small). There are two check-in stands and two concierge stations, which can get cramped and confusing during peak hours. The marble in the lobby is beautiful – but dull. The lighting is a bit odd, with two florescent strips lining the center path from the (very) yellow revolving door to the concierge and registration stations. I can’t put my finger on it but I almost asked if the lobby had been flooded during Sandy.The staff at check-in were friendly and welcoming. The room was very well designed given the limited space. We were in Room 805. Sleek, modern design with a cool little seating area. I’ve stayed in tiny NYC hotel rooms – and although the space was small – they really maximized what they had. It never felt claustrophobic. The enclosed glass tub and shower are not separate but incorporated into the room – in fact it sits right next to the bed. We loved it but it is definitely not for the shy or self-conscious. The view was gorgeous.Noise was a bit of a problem. Not from the street, which I had heard could be a issue at other meatpacking district hotels, but from the hall and the other guests. It is mostly a young, hard partying crowd rolling in at all hours. It woke me up a few times but I tend not to get too stressed out about things like that. I made a mental note for the future.Their was a bit of “fabulous” snobbery in the air. I’ve been around New York enough to recognize it, and mostly, laugh about it and avoid it. Truly fabulous local New Yorkers don’t need the endorsement of allegedly “fabulous” places to feel validated. The only problem was we were in town for a charity and we wanted to meet some of our friends for cocktails at the Standard. After standing in line for quite a long time at the Concierge desk and asking about access to the roof top lounge – I was given a look that melted my hublot watch and was told that our chances of getting in were basically – um – ZERO. Hotel guests are permitted access until 9pm, at which time you are asked to leave. I get it. I’ve been down that road at Dream. I just don’t like it. One of my friends happened to know the GM so we could have gotten in – but we took a pass, if only to register an internal protest. When I asked the concierge for suggestions on where else we might go in the hotel (it was freezing that night) or in the neighborhood, he was essentially unhelpful. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. If you’re going to be elitist, your hotel needs to justify it. The Standard is “good-ish” but doesn’t warrant that level of snobbery.One of our friends was staying at the Tribeca Grand, which has a gorgeous lounge area with a fireplace where guests are welcomed. Another friend was staying at the Bowery Hotel, which makes similar accommodations in their lounge – also beautiful. In the course of the next couple of days we went to both. Outstanding, sexy, low-key.My favorite part of the stay (aside from the location)? The video art in the elevators! Absolutely spell-binding… Side note – watch your step in cold weather heading to the entrance. There is an ice-skating rink. When we were there they were scraping the surface of the ice and taking the ice and snow and dumping it in a pile on the sidewalk in front of the entrance (hmmm…. lawsuit anyone?).Staff (aside from the concierge) was exceedingly friendly and helpful. The room was well designed and chic. Overall it rates a “meh”… just okay.","Miami Beach, FL",36,3.0

The reputation of The Standard is that it's New York hot spot. Checking in at 10:30 p.m. the hotel and the surrounding area was hopping with party goers. The atmosphere was electric. I booked The Standard hotel the day of, through the iPhone app - ""Hotel Tonight"". I saved around $200 from their original asking price. The Hotel Tonight app doesn't carry the same hotels, and doesn't offer the same discounts, so don't bank on getting the same rate, or even an offer for a discount for The Standard each day - it's probably not going to happen. The hotel room was clean and the view of the Empire State building was amazing. There are huge windows in the room. Speaking of windows...if you're booking this hotel with someone not your significant other -beware - the shower is in the middle of the room and has glass walls, so you can see out into the city.

This hotel has quickly become my ""home-away-from home."" I will break down my review into three different categories:-Staff: I choose to stay at the Standard because of its people. The staff here are notable precisely because they treat you like a friend, not like royalty. (It is 2013. I don't need a butler to draw me a bath.) The staff here are the type of folks with whom I'd prefer to chat or invite out for drinks--rather than ask for a replacement roomkey. I've stayed at a number of boutique/trendy hotels, and it is rare to find this combination of professionalism and lack of pretension. -Design: I'll recycle the phrase that everyone uses: ""Anything but standard."" This place is certainly an architectural attraction in and of itself, especially how it curves over the highline. Also, the floor-to-ceiling windows allow for tremendous views from each of the 12+ rooms. On the inside, the rooms feature a mod-meets-nautical vibe. The rooms are very efficiently designed, so the relatively small rooms don't feel that tight. However, the deluxe and corner rooms offer a very welcome step up from the standard and superior room classes, mostly in terms of space and layout. (I've yet to stay in the suites).-Culture: This is a hotel with a soul. I liken it to an adult playground. Andre Balazs (the owner/developer) has managed to pack so many fun bars, restaurants, crepe shacks, disposable-bathing-suit vending machines, and more into this hotel, that you could spend an entire weekend here without stepping outside. OK, you'll need to step outside to go to the hotel's ice skating rink and outdoor raw bar, but I digress.","Waccabuc, New York",0,5.0

We've been meaning to try this place out for a while, and weren't sure if it would be one of those hotels where the look of everything would supersede feeling comfortable. Happily, we had nothing to worry about. The front desk staff were cheery and welcoming and we enjoyed quick chats with them both on checking in and checking out. The only complaint we'd have about checking in is that the staff person said our room number out loud when handing us our key packet. That really shouldn't happen as a matter of security, but we did not request to be reassigned.The rooms are very well-designed with modern furnishings that are also practical. Our room had a banquette and oval table with an extra chair, a king sized bed (slept very well) and a large soaker tub and shower. We had a great view of the Empire State Building. While it wasn't a problem for us, the tub had high walls, so if you have any mobility issues, you may want to inquire about your room's tub. There was a nice bottle of bubble bath provided to make use of the beautiful tub. To echo other reviews, the tub/shower and sink area is separated from the rest of the room by a sheet of crystal clear glass, so you should know your roommate fairly well, or you soon will! There were a few minor issues with our room -- we had to call to get our white quilt replaced as there were a few faint stains on it. Also, we initially thought someone had bolted the front door from the inside when we first arrived -- it turned out the door occasionally would stick and you had to put some muscle into pushing it. That was also the case with the tub/shower faucet -- it was difficult to turn off.During our stay we were happy to see that everyone was there -- little kids skating on the mini rink put up in front of the hotel, older couples in white sneakers, twentysomething women revving up for a party, work colleagues meeting and walking at the same time, etc.We had two excellent meals at the Standard Grill (dinner and breakfast). Both included expertly prepared food (for some reason, the best scrambled eggs ever) and fun and attentive service. We didn't have time to try out the Top of the Standard bar or the Biergarten (literally underneath the Highline) or the outdoor Kaffeklatsch. However, we went to take a look at the Top of the Standard before they opened for the evening and ended up walking in on what looked to be bartender training. Someone came over to us and when we said we were just looking at the space he warmly invited us to return when they opened to have a drink -- we thought he exhibited the really positive welcoming style we experienced with pretty much all of the staff at the Standard.As we like to book little NYC hotel getaways from time to time, we'll definitely think about returning to The Standard.","Mahwah, New Jersey",400,5.0

The service is fantastic, the room beautiful, and the entire vibe is trendy chic without being irritating. The experience begins when you enter the elevator. Each one has a video show, which is truly a work of digital art; a visual scrapbook that somehow seems to blend in Dali, Fellini, and Tim Burton. It would be a great installation at the MoMA. The beds are very comfortable. Nice and firm, but a bit forgiving as there is a high-quality memory foam material that is supportive yet does not retain heat. Despite the fact that the location is perfect for shopping-- from upscale boutiques to indie artists who share their crafts, one could be happy spending a fair amount of time in the hotel. There are two chic cocktail bars, a biergarten and two restaurants. Each has an intimate feeling. The mixologists offer up terrific unique drink options. Last night we enjoyed a live swing band on the 18th floor overlooking the city and the river ( 360 degree view bar/restaurant) The volume was perfect- you could enjoy the music without having to scream. After dinner at The Spice Market, one block away, we returned to the hotel bar where a live DJ mixed some great tunes. The gym is AMAZING. This is NOT a typical hotel fitness center with a lonely treadmill stuffed in a dark room. This was a destination. There are top-of-the-line machines all overlooking the city and the river. Glass from floor to ceiling. We will, without a doubt, be returning.","Boston, Massachusetts",12,5.0

We had amazing views of the Hudson and the Empire State Building from our stylishly appointed room. The rooms and particularly the bathrooms may be microscopic - select wisely. The bell staff were uniformly welcoming and helpful. We observed the concierge staff at times concentrating more on copping an attitude with certain clients rather than doing their job.

After reading reviews on rooms with the best view, we chose the Standard because we wanted a Hudson view and liked the unbeatable location.We originally booked the liberty king room with a Hudson/ downtown view for $485 a night but upon arrival, realized the room was too small for our tastes and had a window directly facing the Gansevort rooftop with all its people looking in. Brian at the front desk quickly helped us personally upgrade our room to a much larger, full Hudson facing room with a beautiful jet tub which we spent hours in while drinking champagne arranged by Brian. He was extremely helpful! Watching the sunset from that room's incredible view , with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking both the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building along with all the boats gong along the Hudson was breathtaking. My only critique of the room was that water easily accumulated on the floor after showering so we had to constantly lay a towel outside the shower.  On Saturday evening around 8ish, we had about 15 friends meet us for cocktails at the Top of the Standard and were worried about everyone's ability to get in but there were no problems - I think the downstairs door began around 10:30pm.It was an incredible way to say goodbye to NYC. Also, for food, Scarpetta, a block away, had an incredible duck dish and banana bread dessert that was one of our best meals while living in NYC. For a cheap but great place to people watch while eating breakfast, we fell in love with the French Toast and Eggs, rice, and beans at the down-home diner, La Bonbonniere.","Munkedal, Sweden",17,4.0

Two tall gals walked out of the club in nothing but bathing suit bottoms. (We all watched with jaws dropped, from the line outside) Just what the hell was our friend getting us in to?We waited in line for no more than 20 minutes, seeing 'suits' and 'men of means' being turned away and worrying that 'OH NO, WE MAY NOT GET IN'. On the contrary. Being 2 girls with 1 guy gave us an advantage. The 'suits' had to take their money elsewhere.Once inside, you're jammed in to an elevator with other starry-eyed folks hoping to get their dance on. The ride is quick, the small talk is awkward. Next, you're thrown onto the first level of the top floors only to find yourself in what looks to be an average niteclub... but that's not so.Just beyond the bar and a little to the right is the hot tub and the amazing person standing watch, overseeing that no one drowns in this 4 feet of hot water, and gets a fresh towel when they're done. Not interested in dancing or a dip? The graffitied stairs will lead you to the roof top where you are greeted by faux-grass, comfy seating and one of the best views of New York City. Mostly just a place to lounge. the rooftop was by far the best part of my experience. It was tranquillity in the midst of all the city Hoopla.It was the perfect way to end my trip.Treat yourself.

The fact that drinks total $25 per drink (tip included) is expected but the fact that, as a hotel guest, you are not allowed entrance to the bar after 9:30pm because you are not a ""member"" just does not sit well when you are paying $300-$500 per night for a room!We always stay at The Gansevort but thought we would try The Standard.

We saw quite a few clean tables. Some had 'reserved' signs on some had none. Our walk from one end of the lounge to the other to decide where to sit lasted about a minute, yet as we retraced our steps to find a table, suddenly every single table had a 'reserved' card.Nevertheless we sat and waited for service. It didn't happen in fact when my husband got the attention of a waiter, the man looked the other way - completely ignoring us. We felt discriminated against and so we lodged a formal complaint with the manager and left.Checking into the hotel took extra long as there was computer glitch the front desk attendant was unable to override. He brought out a supervisor who got it to work. Once in the room I realised it was a lower class than what I had booked. I had booked a deluxe king and was given a king. A big difference was the inclusion of a tub -quite important for me. The room was changed albeit that we ended up on the 8th floor instead of the 16th.For a new hotel I was surprised the rooms were not pristine. My robe (and the robes are black - how awful, not at all like the pics on the website where they are white terry cloth) had bleach marks in the hood and the inside of the gown was not soft and fluffy.our room was cleaned promptly every day. that was great. our room service items were not picked up after we finished. our toiletries were not topped up. Admittedly the toiletries given are perhaps more than double the size you get elsewhere - but the large tub ( it is an amazing tub) takes more than a bottle of the bubble bath to have any effect.The Standard Grill has great food and we found the service to be very good.The gym, although I did not use it, is a wonderful large room with spectacular views.a weird ambiance to the place overall - videos in the elevator after three nights were .... well I could have done without them.The bad experience I had in the lounge really made a stay that was already falling way short of my expectations - much worse.The front desk manager, apologised but said he's had lots of complaints of bad service at the lounge. He refused to give me a report the front desk attendant had made of my complaint, but as he read it to us, it was clear staff were covering for each other's discriminatory behavior.I'd have to advise that you give this place a miss.","Hamilton, Bermuda",94,3.0

The concierge, Malik Sterling, was in email contact and organised a full schedule of New York’s best restaurants and bars for us to visit. During out stay, nothing was too much for Malik and the other front desk staff. They changed bookings, provided dinner and bar recommendations whenever we emailed and even sourced some medicine when I fell ill.The Standard Grill provided some of the best food we had in Manhattan (and we ate everywhere). The bar at the top of the Standard (not the nightclub) has to be one of the nicest bars in Manhattan – hotel guests cannot always access it late at night, but it was a great place to start each evening.If I was forced to make one complaint, it is that the nightclub can be quite loud late at night (Friday / Saturday). But you will probably be out of the hotel at this time, so it is really no bother.The hotel even had an ice rink and beer hall, although we did not get a chance to give these a try!I can’t recommend this hotel enough.

The first one was a 1-day creative meeting held 8:30am-5pm in Garden Rooms A & B, and immediately following that, my company's second off-site was a 2-day strategic meeting held in the High Line Room in a similar time frame with 4 breakout spaces in Gardens Rooms A & B and 2 Liberty Empire King Sleeping Rooms.We experienced successful outcomes on several levels due three factors.The Space.The Garden Rooms consist of 2 large rooms which may be separated by a folding/collapsable wall. We used this space for our Wednesday creative meeting utilizing tables and seating in an informal manner with a podium in the front, a large projection screen at the north end of Garden Room B and another slightly smaller flat screen in Room A. Food and beverages were set up in Room A. Both A & B have large windows and doors overlooking the Beer Garden which is empty during the day, and A has windows looking onto Little West 12th Street. There are bathrooms immediately across the hall from these rooms. Our group of 23 people easily fit completely within Garden B with Garden A acting as F&B location.The High Line Room on the hotel's 3rd Floor was a perfect fit for our 2nd meeting attended by 26 staffers, some of whom had been in Gardens A & B the day before. The high ceilings and windows at either end provided a dramatic space with lots of natural light which did not act as a distraction as we met to focus on our group's strategic future. We set up the room in classroom style with tables for 3 in an irregular pattern from front to back. The 2 doors to the foyer...one on the Hudson River side and one on the High Line side...ensured an excellent traffic pattern for breaks. We had breakfast and beverages set up on the High Line side and lunches set up outside in the foyer. There were 2 bathrooms available in the foyer for attendees. We used the room's large projection screen and sound system throughout our time in the High Line Room. Our set-up was struck on the first day at 5pm in order to accommodate an evening event, but when we returned the following morning all furniture was as we left it. When it came time for our large group to break up into smaller groups, we used Garden Rooms A & B and 2 Empire Liberty King accommodation rooms with the beds removed. The Staff.The meeting and events staff of The Standard High Line NYC was accommodating and among the most professional I've encountered in the 5 years and 8 meetings I've planned and produced in my current position. Our event was not without a few snafus (and I emphasis the word ""few""), but the staff rose to the challenge and solved our several issues. I was able to call on any one of several hotel staff members at any time and by day 2 had developed a rhythm of agenda review with event staff. They are a solid, seasoned team who were on call, and on-site, as we continued with our meetings.The Food.My colleagues were very pleased with the array of breakfast, snack and lunch items made available to them. Over the course of 3 days, we were served 3 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 3 morning snacks and 1 afternoon snack. The hotel staff replenished trays regularly and took our notes. The first day's lunch consisted of sandwiches on french loaves. This was too ""bread-y"" for our people. When we had sandwiches 2 days later, we requested them be made with lighter breads such as multi-grain and whole wheat. The hotel chef's listened and accommodated our request. Other than the bread issue, there were no complaints about the food.I cannot recommend The Standard High Line NYC enough as an off-site meeting location particularly for creative and strategic meetings for entertainment and media companies. Having recently experienced their hospitality, I'm a firm believer in their ability to service and accommodate creative executives in their Garden A & B rooms and their unique, beautiful High Line Room. I will be in their debt for helping me produce 2 very successful executive-level meetings.A special shout out to Amy & Austin in events, and Jessica in room accommodations.","New York City, New York",5,5.0

While the Standard isn't perfect, or the most luxurious hotel I've tried, it has been my favorite place to stay in NYC for several years.A big part of the Standard's appeal is its location. Straddling the Highline, its rooms offer truly beautiful views of the Hudson River and downtown Manhattan (or Chelsea and midtown, depending on which side of the hotel you stay on). The hotel is just a short walk from Chelsea's art galleries and the West Village's great array of shops and restaurants. These are charming, walkable neighborhoods that I find make a much more pleasant base to explore NYC from than Midtown.Another thing that has kept me coming back to the Standard for several years is the consistently excellent room service and restaurant. There are fancier, more gastronomically ambitious restaurants in Manhattan hotels than the Standard Grill, but I can't think of any that are more of a pleasure to eat at regularly at all times of the day.The rooms are well-designed and with their floor to ceiling windows and ample light they don't feel cramped even though they aren't enormous. I love that the design manages to be minimalist while still feeling cozy.I've tried Standard King, Empire Corner King, Liberty Corner King, and Hudson Studio rooms and would recommend the Hudson Studio. It's the most spacious type of room and has the best views, and being able to soak in the huge tub while watching the sun set over the Hudson is pretty amazing.Now for the downsides: the front desk can feel under staffed. The hotel could do a better job maintaining the rooms and the linens. Twice I've checked in to find a faded stain on a (clearly laundered) duvet or, one time, a crack in the ceiling's wood paneling with tape covering it. The hotel is in an area of the city that is a nightlife destination and some of the rooms I've had on the north-facing side of the hotel have had some noise (this includes Empire Corner Kings, which are on higher floors). The noise wasn't enough to be an issue for me, a city dweller used to such sounds, but I could see how it might have bothered lighter sleepers. I'd recommend rooms on the southern side of the hotel if you're sensitive to noise (these have the best views, anyway). I should also note that in some of the rooms (including the Hudson Studio, my favorite) the shower is visible from the sitting/sleeping area. Sexy if you're traveling with your lover, but not so appealing if you're sharing the room with a platonic friend. In that case, I'd recommend the Empire Corner King, which has the most private bathing area.Despite its occasional shortcomings, I've stayed at the Standard many times over the last few years, most recently in November 2012. The rooms, especially the Hudson Studio, feel like my dream mini-loft in downtown NYC, with the added bonus of an excellent professional kitchen on call. Can't beat that.","New York City, New York",47,4.0

But the Standard hotel did not disappoint at all. It has some issues, but nonetheless, it’s all about being a hip hotel in the best spot in Manhattan, right on the HighlinePROS :- Location, location, location : it’s position above the Highline makes it unique and therefore worth my 5 star rating. The hotel takes in a lot of daylight (not evident in Manhattan). After a day of sightseeing or business, you can strol the highway, go for a run along the Hudson River, and get peace of mind again. Also, because of the orientation of the hotel, you can watch perfect sunsets from the southern rooms or the rooftop bar (or from the Highline itself of course). The hotel is also right in the middle of the Meatpacking district, the best spot in town for dinner or club. Not too far away (a few blocks, 5 minute walk) is the Blue subway line which is one of the most convenient ones from a tourist point of view.- Rooms : modern, extremely comfortable beds (the best bed I ever slept in : better than Four Seasons and ‘alikes’), very decently sized for Manhattan … and again, views to die for, especially from the northern rooms with look out onto Midtown Manhattan- The restaurant (Standard Grill) offers some of the best steaks in town, but make sure to reserve weeks ahead for a weekend (you can do that online)- The rooftop-bar has some of the best views in town (looking out over both Downtown and Midtown), and be sure to use their toilets (and again, be wow-ed by the view)CONS :- The hotel is oriented towards a younger clientele, with music in the entrance and elevator. This may be bothersome and too loud to some. Nevertheless, I was silent in my room (although many reviewers here complain from noise in the lower located rooms).- It is a shame that the architects of the newly build hotel did not have an outdoor space at the roof in mind. New York in summer is all about outdoor rooftops, and this is a missed opportunity for the hotel (tip : the Gansevoort hotel one block away has a great outdoor rooftop)- Service is sometimes rude and lackingThe Standard hotel is my hotel of choice for my next trips to New York. I prefer it over brands such as the Four Seasons, Setai, and St Regis, just because of the unique location, but if service is essential to you, then you better stick to latter brands. Be sure to request a room on a higher floor with views of Midtown.","Brussels, Belgium",665,5.0

It is New York, Manhattan so I will give some allowance for that but what you need to know is that parking is almost non existing. You cannot drive your car in to the hotel or into a parking lot. Supposedly a valet will come on to the street to take your car and drive it to a parking lot for you. If you haven't experienced NY traffic, you have a shock coming. No valet was available on the day of our arrival. The hotel waiting area was small and crowded. The room was supposedly king size deluxe but only the bed in my opinion. Few plugs for electronics, the bed was low to the floor and reasonably comfortable. The shower and tub was decent with plenty towels. However, be aware that the hotel contains an ice skating rink and the people are so loud all night long that you cannot sleep. Add to that noise, police sirens, EMS sirens, honking horns from impatient drivers, street walkers hollering and screaming all of which could be heard on the 5th floor. This noise goes on and on until 5 am! Also, be aware that their website may show you pictorial views overlooking the Hudson but what you may get is a view of the street and a warehouse! Further, you need to know that they will leave you a letter in the room warning you that if you have street window views, that you must keep your window curtains drawn so that no one sees you from the street level. So much for that great room view huh? Bottom line, I think you could do much better and get more for $250 dollars per night. The hotel tries hard to project a trendy, funky, techno type look but for me, it fails.","Moorpark, California",12,3.0

The Bar at the top on the 18th Floor has some of the best views this city has to offer and every server is gorgeous. This room had a very VIP feel to it with many of the best seats reserved well in advance. Jazz quartet at night, champagne by the glass, unique cocktails. A swanky James Bond style retreat worth seeking out. The American Grill is outstanding and has earned its own review. See separate write up with photos of the incredible cuisine. One of the great features of the hotel is the proximity to the Highline Walking Trail. It all just came together in an upcoming trendy fashion and bistro focused neighbourhood on the waterfront.

After a long 23 hour trip, reached the hotel. Check in was fast. The room was also great, something different from other typical hotels. After the first night, next day woke up at. 3 pm and left the room by 3.30 pm after calling up house keeping that I was leaving and that they could send someone to clean the room. I come back at 6 pm and the room has still not been cleaned. I call up guest services and they apologize and they say they are sending someone ASAP. I go down to the lobby to have a cup of coffee and wait for my room to be cleaned up. I come back at 7.15 pm and horror of horrors, room has still not been cleaned. I call them up and tell them to please cancel my booking for the remaining days as an unkempt hotel room is the worst thing about an overseas trip. Finally at 7.25 pm someone shows up and is cleaning the room while I type this review. Am I being too fussy? Maybe yes but the point remains that we are paying more than 300 dollars per night for a hotel room and least you can expect is a clean room after you come back. Another strange thing. Called up the hotel concierge and requested him to book table for 2 at their rooftop bar. He got back saying sorry ""they don't take table reservations"" and I will have to try my luck at the door. So much for the advantage of staying at the hotel. The GM did call to apologize for the housekeeping faux pax but too late. Moving tomorrow to the next door Ganseveort.

It's definitely trying hard to be ""cool"" (Exhibit A -- the video running in the dark elevator http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKUbtYzMnaE ) . We were mistakenly given a Queen (after paying for the Superior King). I went downstairs to get it straightened out -- to be told that there were no rooms available in my category. Ha...that's funny (after already paying for Superior King). Never take no for answer when it comes to hotels. I thought the Queen room had a fantastic view of Hudson River -- but the room was small and bed was up against the wall (only one side was accessible). Not very comfortable in our opinion. So in about 5 minutes of discussion with the management they miraculously had a superior king for us. The room was bigger, a bit more roomy, and King bed was in placed properly with access on both sides. The view was of the city -- very nice view of the Empire State Building (as opposed to the Hudson River). Same set up with a bit more space -- big glass wall, nice big tv, comfortable bed, nice linens and pillows and towels. Same all glass shower -- there are no walls to the shower stall --- just glass -- so make sure you are comfortable showering in front of your roomie or you may want to ask them to hit the gym. Not family friendly ;) HERE IS THE WARNING!!! Any to the rooms ending in 1 (we stayed in 801) are unbelievably noisy due to the elevator -- ALL night and day the elevator shaft and doors slam. We had a horrible night sleep as we were awoken every 10 minutes or so. It was a sleeping disaster. I presume the other, more distant rooms, are more conducive for sleeping -- but the rooms ending in ""1"" are a nightmare. Be forewarned. We thought the hotel was interesting and the restaurant attached to the hotel was very nice, civilized brunch.

Lots of happy people outside. The entrance is a yellow revolving door under the High Line Park. The lobby's painted in black, as are the elevators (little videos display offer the only light in them).Room 8.06 on the 8th floor has uptown views which were really fantastic (floor-to-ceiling windows). Only the toilet has a door, the shower stands in the middle of the room, next to the bed. Right at the window is a table with a small couch and chair. At first glance the room's very clean. At a second one, the rooms seems to have seen better days: smears on the room door, discoloration on the mattress, squeeky furniture, stains on the ceilings. We did however feel comfortable there - we slept well and the floor was pretty quiet in general.Service: bellmen very nice and helpful, receptionist, too. Cleaning staff are equipped with walkie-talkies (which are very loud), mini-bar service personnel don't give you any chance to walk up to the door upon knocking and stand in your room after a few seconds. Not ideal.Top of The Standard: We went up one evening and walked right through (we were there before the party started) to look around and have a few (very expensive and ""nothing special"") drinks.

We paid $205 a night which I thought was a great rate for a good location in Manhattan. The hotel is - well, weird. We thought it felt like a 1970's cruise ship meets spaceship. The room was a good size, small, but not for Manhattan standards. We had a little sitting area with a couch and table and a king sized bed. The shower and sink area overlooks the room, so no privacy for people in the shower. The views are amazing. We faced North, over all of Midtown Manhattan. The views make this hotel. It was amazing to wake up and see the skyline of Manhattan. We stayed on the 14th floor, which was far enough down from the club that we didn't hear anything - I had heard sound was a problem - I thought the hotel was much quieter than other places we have stayed. Overall, I would say that this is a good hotel to stay at if you want to be central to the Meatpacking District, plus within walking distance of West Village, Greenwich Village, and we even walked to the East Village and Lower East Side. It is starting to feel a little ""dated"" in a dirty way - carpets are very light and staring to show their age, plus the bathrooms didn't feel super luxurious. But if you can get a good rate (around $200 a night) I think it is a good place to stay.One tip: Parking is FREE on weekends on the service road directly behind the hotel (parallel to the Westside Freeway). We arrived at 4pm on Friday and it had just turned free, we pulled up, and parked for free all the way until Sunday afternoon.

The upstairs bar is super-cool - although the reception staff are rather unwelcoming - but concierge staff on the other hand were always friendly and helpful. We did experience a couple of plumbing issues during our stay which was surprising, although not sure if Hurricane sandy had anything to do with it: the toilet stopped working early one morning and took a couple of hours to rectify. In addition, the hot water was lost to the hotel on our last morning and took some hours to rectify (although I believe this was related to the area, and not specific to the hotel).

But afterwards, I realised these were just recommandations given by people never having been to the Standard High Line.The meatpacking district: amazing. The bar: unique. The hotel: a huge disappointment.First entering the reception, small, cold, it seems more like a waiting room than a ""welcoming room"", due to the size, the furniture and not to forget the greasy smells coming from the restaurant. As to the general style of the hotel, it is supposed to be 50s vintage, but it is rather cheap plastic imitation, and I know what I am talking about. The furniture seems dirty, not being of high quality, such as the curtains and carpets, and the much too small closets.Going to the room, you come through neon light corridors with noisy airconditioning. Our room, the Deluxe King (9th), was tiny, stains on the carpet, dirty curtains, and hardly any space to put away clothes. View on some construction works and behind, a bit of the hudson river. We asked for an upgrade and ended up in the Empire Corner King room, on the 4th floor. Following the pictures on the website: loads of space, fantastic decoration. In reality: you have to climb the bed to be able to close the curtain... With a rate of €755 per night, and a 4star rating, you would suppose there was a bath, body milk, breakfast included, or at least 2 sinks. No, not in this case. And worse, no isolation whatsoever neither outside nor inside. The hunking taxis seemed to be in our room (until early in the morning) and showering neighbours are apparently also part of the ""standard experience"". Not to mention that during our 4th night, the hotel staff started some drilling works on our floor, at 5 am!!!! Even after giving a call to the reception, they didnt show up, no excuse, and the works continued at least for 30 minutes... As to the personel in general, a lack of experience didnt add up to make us feel better. At breakfast, ordering a coffee without milk, we got one with milk. Asking for granola without berries, we got one with berries, and this went on. Very friendly people however, and being on vacation, this shouldnt really bother. Very professional though was the concierge, Tim, and he really stands out!

I'd booked a superior queen which only covers floors 4-17 so they were true to their word and we were shown to a room on the 14th floor when we arrived. The views are just stunning. The room was very clean and as described. Enjoying a shower in the wet room whilst still being able to admire the view is brilliant! There were lots of towels, nice clean robes, and the bed was very comfortable indeed. The only issue was being right by the lifts (room 18) meant it was a little noisy, and on the one night they had a function up on the 17th floor the music travelled down the lift shafts and I had to go for my ear plugs. The location of the hotel is excellent for the subway, and walking north along the Highline is a pleasure. The bar on the 17th floor while expensive is fantastic, the German beer place underneath left a little to be desired. Overall though, a fantastic place to stay!","Surbiton, United Kingdom",30,4.0

I visited the restaurant back in 2010 and it was exactly the same at that time.

I finally made it to my room (on the 6th Floor) and I did not manage to sleep due to the noise coming from the street. The day after I asked to be relocated on a higher floor. The new room was close enough to the bar upstairs...so here we go again with the noise. As it wasn't sufficiently loud enough my neighbors decided to have a party in the room. The music was extremely high. I called the concierge and ask them to do something about it. At 1 am the music was still loud and I asked to check out (and I booked myself at the amazing St. Regis). I asked them not to charge me the night and they refused. In essence...terrible hotel... noisy... awful customer service and the rooms are far from spectacular....

First, don't get me wrong - this hotel is very popular and sort of exudes this hip urban vibe that is difficult to not want to be a part of. The location is excellent and for that alone, maybe worth the plus 500.00 a night room rate. For what this hotel puts itself out there as, however, it falls a little short. The rooms : while incredibly clean and well serviced every day, and fabulous views was like a dorm room. No room for luggage or clothing or toiletries. For a short trip workable, but this space crunch wore on me as time went on. The shower has a major design flaw - just a short piece of glass separating it from the rest of the bathroom - leaving water all over the bathroom floor every day which necessitated towels on the floor just to get ready. We were on the 14th floor with views of the Hudson - that was fab - and no noise from the club or the street below on that floor. We ate in the Standard Grill for breakfast - frankly awful service. They brought the wrong orders and when we pointed it out - the very surly waiter without a single word picked them back up and walked away. Really?? Your not that special. Save yourself the aggravation here. There are plenty of places nearby to eat with good service. The front desk staff was friendly but unhelpful. The concierge couldn't be bothered to even pick up the phone to see if we could get a restaurant reservation- telling us to just walk down the street and go on in and ask if we could get a table. Another really?? moment. Another concierge sent us to the gallery district in Chelsea. We specifically asked if the galleries had reopened since Sandy and he told us yes - ummm no. We went there - not a single first floor gallery open and only a handful of second floor galleries. I guess I should've googled. Who knew the concierge would lack the knowledge of such basics within the neighborhood of the hotel. Perhaps I'm picky - but when you go to a hotel such as this - these are basics that should be delivered stellarly. That just didn't happen here. The bell staff were the best and most helpful. Friendly guys who remembered you every day and were always offering to help. Nightclub? Impossible. Closed for private parties for several nights - which also means by the way that the hotel elevators are reduced from 4 to 2- as if the hotel guests are the afterthought. The decor is hip and modern, and there are always people around everywhere - lots of great shopping and restaurants. I might stay here again, but was disappointed with the service issues, micro room and shower flaw. It was cool- sure, but not very inviting and comfortable. ",chicago illinois,53,3.0

Pros- great location, easy walking distance to the galleries of Chelsea, Union Square, the Village and Soho. Immediate neighbourhood seems a bit contrived with high end retail juxtaposed against a faux biker-bar. The front desk staff are both cheerful and helpful, but lack of signage at street level as well as at the front desk (concierge vs. check-in staff) seemed needlessly precious. Room design, especially windows on two sides and a view of the Hudson may get us back. The cheeky blandishments from all New Yorkers we met to ""get busy"" in front of the floor to ceiling windows were cute. The mondo-groovy, so hip-it-hurts, clientel in the lobby not so much. The 18th floor bar, when open to the hotel patrons (another post, to be sure) was well worth the hefty tab.

I'm an experienced traveller who spends at least 50 nights in hotels per year mostly for business and all over the world, so I know what makes a hotel work and what doesn't. The location of this hotel is fantastic and I'm glad we stayed in the Meatpacking District during our first stay in New York. It's a great base to travel into SoHo, Greenwich Village etc. As for the building, it's very cool looking and on the wonderful High Line and our room was clean and tidy and well maintained. There is also a great little gym on the 17th floor which has modern and clean equipment and great views across the Hudson - great for a later afternoon workout on sunset. So from a location perspective a big thumbs up.However I feel compelled to outline my thoughts on this hotel as there are evidently there are far too many (how shall I put it....) ""fanboy"" reviews which make me suspicious and therefore I think it is important to offer a different perspective based on our stay.Room type: We booked an Empire Corner King and were sent to our room on the 4th floor which had views of a building site (opposite) and walls of the opposing buildings (hardly the beautiful corner views of Midtown per the description). This particular room had no bath so we called the front desk and were told that these rooms didn't have baths. Funny thing was that the floor plans on the .pdf brochure they sent us indicated baths in these rooms (this was the reason why we chose this room) and only after digging this out and going down to the front desk and pointing to their brochure did they relent and moved us to the 11th floor, where yes, the room had fantastic views.Noise: Not an issue for me as I travel a lot so a good set of earplugs is par for the course the minute I leave the house! If you are on a low floor on a Friday / Saturday night then you are in big trouble from the street noise as you'll get honking horns, shouting, and Police sirens until the sun comes up - what you'd probably expect in a happening area. As I said, we were on the 11th floor and the street noise wasn't an issue with ear plugs in - but one to be aware of. The further up the floors you go then I think you then hit the second noise issue from the nightclub which other posters have commented on. Again, I cannot comment on this but the 11th floor seemed to not suffer from this issue so a good floor to be on and might be one to request!Internet: Echoing other comments, yes it is very slow and yes it's ridiculous to have another ""high speed"" service for a daily charge considering there is free high speed internet in most department stores and restaurants in NYC. Why the hotel feels the need to charge $20 when I'm paying over $650 per night I don't know (just give us a decent connection please and no high speed / low speed apartheid nonsense).Breakfast: I guess we were somewhat dismayed (it was a jaw-drop moment for me) that the hotel considers it necessary to charge extra for breakfast when you're paying over $650 a night. So we didn't bother and we went out nearby which probably turned out to be a much better option based on what others have said here.The Roof Top Bar: This is probably my biggest gripe. We stayed for four nights and this was closed on all of them for private events. We only managed to go in for an afternoon drink on our last day and it was fantastic.A word of caution is that when these events are on the hotel went from four lifts (elevators to our American friends!) to two which proved ""challenging"" (to say the least) when returning in the early hours. I think the record was a 10 minute wait to get a lift to our floor which (to add insult to injury) was when there was also an event on the 3rd floor with only one lift available for guests to use.I'm not sure that the hotel management team have really thought this one through with 338 guest rooms and one lift in use at times, plus the lifts are also used by housekeeping, room service and the bell boys for luggage. When several people waiting in the rapidly assembled mob in the lift lobby questioned the ""one lift"" omnishambles, the lift operator said ""yes, we're all angry"" as the doors again closed and she returned to the 3rd floor to collect more venue guests and bring them down to the Lobby.I think the moral here is if you are thinking of staying at the Standard High Line so you get to use the fabulous rooftop bar (made famous in the film Shame) then think again. And I'd actually go as far as saying that hotel guests are treated as more of an inconvenience compared to those hiring out the venues. From reading some of the other reviews again I now see that others had similar feelings for good reason - and I retract back my initial thoughts about other reviewers being over dramatic / sensitive.Following on from what seemed like the eternally unavailable Roof Top Bar, we asked the Concierge for a suggestion for another bar to go to for a drink and were directed to one 4 blocks away which turned out to be an invite only place which wasn't even open. A big hint here: If you're gonna hire out your bar to those more important than your hotel guests then at least have the decency to have a list of alternative bars nearby which guests can go to, and are also open!Cost: Our room came to over $650 per night with taxes and quite frankly with the above mentioned issues I think this is very poor value. Without the Roof Top Bar and access to the club (as other posters mentioned) there is nowhere else to go in the hotel other than sit in the Reception / Lobby area and the Biergarten. I speak as someone who stays regularly at the Ritz's and Shangri-La's of the world where there are always other options.In conclusion, I know this sounds like a rant type review and I normally read (and ignore) them and think ""that person must have just been an awkward so-and-so or having a bad day"", but I think there needs to be some balance to the fanboy reviews. I think it would be a fantastic place to stay if you were fortunate enough to be attending an event and actually get to use the great rooftop facilities. But for us mere proles hoping to experience a cool hotel with cool bars there has to be a better option out there and next time I return to NYC I hope to find it.Would I stay in The Standard again? I think you already know the answer.","London, United Kingdom",12,2.0

Request a North side view w/ views of the Empire State Bldg.The mini bar is great, lots of high quality choices, though no espresso machine in the room.The negatives (and I am being picky, but honest): and the reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars.The bathroom was not as clean as I would have liked. Lots of stains in the toilet room on the walls and tiles had dust, kind of bothered me.The bathtub is so high, like 3 feet, it was hard to step into and out of it, almost dangerous.And lastly, there is no real closet, so no where to hang a coat or jacket or dress. They need some more hooks in the foyer of the rooms to hang a coat........Other than that, it wasn't as scary hip as I thought it would be (we are 47), and we would definitely stay here again, maybe in a better room upgrade........but we appreciated the nice rates during a difficult time for so many displaced New Yorkers and New Jerseyans.","Summit, New Jersey",129,4.0

Sorry guys but I want to see the entrance and exit, I realize the revolving door was broken due to the storm but mark the other doors and spell your name correctly. Now for the good: the room was very nicely laid out, it's modern but comfortable, I like the furniture, bathroom and so forth, it's not huge but it works. Likewise the restaurant is very good indeed, as is the lounge for a cocktail. The service was friendly and the dinner was a good value. Overall it was a good stay which for me was caused by not having power a few streets away in my apartment.

After enduring a week of no power, internet, television and gas rationing my mother decided to treat me to a night at The Standard, one of my favorite spots whose bar and restaurant I have frequented for almost 2 years. When we called to make the reservation we were told the hotel was up and running, however, when I arrived I was told that wifi was only accessible in the lobby. No problem, at least I would have electricity and heat for one night. The first employee who helped me at check-in, part of the Concierge, was very pleasant and helpful. However there was a problem checking in with my credit card (a new card I received the day before) and he asked for help from the manager on duty, Kai. Unlike the first man who assisted me, Kai did not have one ounce of warmness, friendliness and any other quality a person in his profession should have. The bank told me that my card could be charged at midnight and that the funds would then be available, and Kai told me I could not be checked in until after midnight. My mother and I felt that I shouldn’t wait 7 hours in the lobby to check in, so we decided to use her card via the hotel’s website to prepay for the room, as she has done for many of my vacations both within and outside of the U.S. However, when Kai saw that my mother had paid for the room he once again refused to check me in. I told him if he wished to confirm he could telephone her, but he told me that the hotel does not allow guests to check in to rooms that are prepaid by another individual. I then told him that I was sure I was not the only guest whose room was being paid for by another individual, to which he replied that my mother would have to fill out a form he could email to her, sign it and fax it back. I told him my mother and I lived in a town in New Jersey where there was absolutely no power or internet connection (she only had email/internet access via her iPhone), even our street lights were out as well as most local business, and it was Sunday evening, and that my entire purpose for my stay at The Standard was due to my week-long inaccessibility to electricity. He still adamantly refused to assist, no compassion or sincereness whatsoever. At that point, after a week of exhaustion from the hurricane and the sheer humiliation I endured in front of other guests who were checking in, I gave up and returned home. My valet fee was waived, but my car was parked around the corner, I had to ask for my key and I was not assisted with my bags. It was clear that I was not a wanted guest at this hotel. Its been 3 days and the $309.59 for the room has still not been debited back to my mother’s credit card, furthermore, another $521.07 was charged to her card and no one has returned our emails and/or phone calls.I will never return to The Standard for dinner, for drinks or in any other capacity. Downtown New York itself is still just recovering, yet Kai made it clear that despite the difficulties my mother and I faced along with millions of others not having power, he refused to assist and accommodate my reservation despite the fact that my room had been paid for. Even more so, we have not been refunded our money yet and another $521 has been charged. I had also driven to the hotel on rationed fuel that I had to wait almost 2 hours for earlier that day, so that was a quarter tank of hard-to-come-by fuel completely down the drain. Kai completely lacked the graciousness and accomability that he demonstrated with the other guests, and had no compassion whatsoever towards my ordeal and the purpose of my intended stay at The Standard. NEVER AGAIN.","New York City, New York",15,1.0

When there was a malfunction with the alarm system at the Standard New York (keeping us up part of the night), the hotel contacted me the next day to offer a free room. When I used it at the Standard Miami, I was upgraded to a better room and, thanks to the kindest and courtesy of the staff, enjoyed one of the relaxing stays I've had in a long history of travel.I booked a night at the Standard New York on July 4. I got engaged earlier in the day and requested a room with a view of the Hudson River fireworks. Although the person who booked my room was careful to tell me that nothing could be guaranteed, we wound up with a perfect view of the fireworks and I could not have been happier. Unfortunately, the hotel's alarm malfunctioned later that night, keeping us awake for a few hours. The next day, before I could even reach out to the hotel, they contacted me! Michael at the Standard New York could not have been more apologetic or courteous, and we both agreed that a second chance was only fair. I have to confess, I now feel lucky we were woken up. When I had a long layover in Miami last month, Michael put me directly in touch with the management of the standard Miami. They set us up with a room right away. When we arrived, Jose was at reception. He not only put as at ease, he upgraded our room, helped us with our bags himself, and generally put us in a great mindset to enjoy our time there. By the time we left, we knew that if we ever lived in Miami, we would be joining the spa. I am not sure whether Jose knew what had happened in New York. Either way, the efforts of both Michael and Jose have ensured that whenever we have a chance, we will be staying at a Standard again, be it in New York, Miami, or anywhere in the world.","New York City, New York",3,5.0

Also contacted them to make same request on arrival in NYC three days arlier. We were put into a room on 15th floor which altough had AMAZING views of the Hudson River and Lower Manhatten was very noisy at night. The night club goes till around 3am, Thurs- Sat nights. We went up to the other bar on same level and were kept waiting for over 15 mins and so when we did not get served, walked out. Staff are very pretentious and if your not part of the glamour set and under 25 you dont seem to count. The rooms are very clean, very small but very groovy and well appointed although there was no tea or coffee facilities in the room. When I pointed this out the receptionist said all we had to do was ask, but for the huge tarriff I would have thought this was standard issue in all rooms.

The bed ware and towels are clean but do not smell fresh. The bathroom has a clear window towards the bed and has a big bath tube where 2 persons can sit comfortably. The free WiFi Internet service does not work during busy hours and is quite frustrating. You can upgrade for USD 20 to paid services which is not much better and thus a waste of money.

I go to use the toilet (#1) and it takes 3 flushes for anything to go down. Because I've now wasted almost two hours getting into the room, only the late night menu is available for room service. I ask if any of the restaurants are still serving dinner, ""yes, until 2am."" I call the grill to make sure there's a table available, they say sure come on down. I go down to the grill and have to wait 15 minutes for a table. I get seated and the menu is the EXACT same as the room service late night menu. I order a soup and salad and to be fair, it was quite good.I go back upstairs to go to shower and then sleep. I take a shower, but there's no door on the shower so the bathroom floor ends up with a pool of water on it which I have to mop up with a towel.

Although we walk the High Line during every NYC visit and thus pass under the Standard, this was just our second stay here.  For my first visit, the hotel was just the Standard (since the Standard East Village was not yet opened and would first be called the Cooper Square Hotel), and it was not completely finished--upper floor rooms plus the top floor spaces that would become the Boom Boom Room (later the Top of the Standard) and Le Bain lounges were still under construction. The second phase of the High Line was also unfinished. The fairly large outdoor space in front of the lobby was not as fully realized as it is now. We had a deluxe queen room, I believe, that faced south with West Village, downtown and Hudson River views, and had an enclosed WC and shower drainage issues.For this visit, I noticed many changes with the Meatpacking District, Chelsea, and the hotel itself. New restaurants, bars, clubs and boutiques have sprung up, although such venerable institutions as Old Homestead Steakhouse and Pastis restaurants remain. The meatpacking warehouse across the street from the hotel, where I distinctly (and fondly) remember having to weave my way around trash bins full of discarded carcasses, is gone. The commercial building north of the hotel on 14th St. is completed, and blocks some northern hotel views. The High Line's second phase has opened, extending the gorgeous elevated park to near Madison Square Garden. An entire new community called Hudson Yards is being developed at this north end, while at the High Line's south terminus, the Whitney Museum is building a branch. The revitalization of Chelsea owes very much to the High Line, including buildings by famous architects Frank Gehry and Jean Nouvel.The hotel itself has changes as well. The outdoor space fronting the lobby now has 2 dining/drinking areas--one an extension of the Standard Grill (a trellised patio with mature, very realistic-looking but faux vines that went up in a week, according to our waiter), plus the Standard Plaza. There's also the Biergarten directly under the High Line. There is a large sculpture that reminded me of SpongeBob Squarepants. Gone are the yellow metal one-piece tables and benches that generated no income. There is a skating rink here in the winter.In a hotel such as this where style and image are its lifeblood, I usually resign myself to expect so-so service. We were pleasantly surprised to receive very friendly service from every staffer we encountered, no matter how good-looking they were. And they ALL were, with such stylish uniforms, especially the bellboys with their high-water pants and sockless lace-up shoes.For this visit we booked a Hudson Studio room, thanks to an online flash sale. I believe these are the largest rooms, aside from the suites, and there is one per floor. All primarily face west (Hudson River and New Jersey), with walls of glass also facing north (Empire State Building, High Line) and south (High Line, Freedom Tower at the 9/11 Memorial, downtown and West Village, Statue of Liberty). These king-bedded rooms have an open floor plan--the bathroom and bedroom/sitting area are demarcated only by carpet vs. tile flooring. Half of the bathtub is in the ""bedroom"". The stall shower with rain head is akin to standing in an exhibit case in a museum, like a piece of sculpture. Only the WC has a sliding door for privacy, although there are still floor to ceiling windows in there as well. The hotel is infamous for its clear-windowed rooms that can be en exhibitionist's dream--one can brazenly (or mistakenly) ""perform"" for audiences on the High Line, just like Michael Fassbender's character in the NC-17 film ""Shame"". This character had trysts in a Hudson Studio just like ours (by the window near the bathtub). And Carey Mulligan's character sang ""New York, New York"" in the Top of the Standard. Even regular room like on our first visit have peekaboo bathrooms. And since all rooms have only one bed, the hotel is not well suited for young families or business acquaintances, unless you don't mind these folks seeing you bathe or poop. I don't recall seeing any children at the hotel during either stay, which is not a bad thing.The top (18th) floor has 2 lounges/clubs. The Top of the Standard was closed for remodeling, but is the more formal space. The adjacent Le Bain, meanwhile, sports a large hot tub and has an upstairs rooftop outdoor deck complete with a VIP area, waterbeds and the same views as the Hudson Studios and gym, except higher and grander. We paid a late afternoon visit to the deck and drank in the views with a cocktail and crepe from the cute crepe/gelato stand (both sweet and savory crepes served). In the evenings, these lounges become crowded, velvet rope and doormen affairs, with 2 elevators designated for club use only. Other TA reviews note problems with noise from these clubs, especially on higher floors. Because of this, we asked for a mid to low floor and got the 5th floor. The Hudson Studios are all situated directly under Le Bain, and while I heard some thumping music at times, the room was more quiet than I expected. Even with the long-standing Brass Monkey bar, whose patio backs up against the south side of the Standard, noise was not an issue.The hotel lack a bit in amenities. There is free WiFi, but no business center. There is a nice fitness center on the 17th floor with fab views as mentioned above, but no spa. I remember for our first visit, the room's many bath products were cleverly packaged in generic (Kiss My Face brand) bottles to match the bath's laboratory-like sink area. For this stay, we noticed markedly less products (only bubble bath and one bar of soap for the sink), with those gym-like refillable pump dispensers in the shower.The hotel continues to thrive in a forever changing neighbourhood. There is no hotel better located in these parts, and that simple fact warrants return visits.",Los Angeles CA,1201,4.0

(note to self: boycott intel). so left with small stuffy room with no aircon. not good. and makes me wonder if hotel guests are indeed what this hotel is all about - 2 of the 4 elevators shut off to hotel guests and preserved for the massive queue of people trying to get to L18 bar. so guest elevator queue is very long. plus there is people trying to jump bar queue by getting in guest elevator, even though they dont go to L18, which is clogging up the guest elevators massively. last time i was here there was a staff member preventing this nonsense by ensuring only hotel guests accessed guest elevators, but i guess that guy got culled, bar must be much more profitable. note to owner - this is a hotel - hotel guests should be treated as such, not as an annoying after thought to the roof bar clientele. not happy.

Similarly there are a good quantity of interesting characters to liven things up. All of this is to be expected in this part of Manhattan.The rooftop bar is great and the staff who work the area are hardworking and speedy. The top floor cocktail bar is underwhelming (although decadently decked out). The seating hostesses are very haughty and the service is no way deserving of the huge service tariff (you should know how to make an Appletini!). Wind your neck in! Yours is a margins business. I'm not going to pay you 30% more for a glass of wine so you can sneer at me and give me a crap seat when the bar downstairs is cheaper, friendlier and more fun. I stay here regularly for work.

The Standard does not disappoint. If you are looking for some real downtime ""off the grid""' consider another hotel (in this case, our go to hotel is the Greenwich for it's understated elegance and low key vibe). But if you are looking to be in the center of the action, The Standard is your place. That being said, The Standard is a place that could take itself too seriously and it could be rife with attitude but it just isn't. Every staff member is friendly, helpful and professional; when they walk by you, they never fail to acknowledge you and say hello from the moment you arrive. (On that note, a special mention is in order for Jeffrey at the front desk, Robert (breakfast), Pamela (lunch), Craig (dinner) at the Standard Grille and the housekeeping staff on the 13th floor. If you're thinking of staying in NYC, it's probably for all that NY has to offer, but you could seriously never leave the property and feel like you had a complete vacation even if it's just an overnight stay. The Standard is a feast for the senses, whimsical (the kissing dog salt and pepper shakers, the waitstaff uniforms, the elevators, etc.) in a Disneyesque (for adults) way. The Top of the Standard is easily the most glamorous room in Manhattan with its decor, view and the lovely Ruben Chappelle designed dresses the servers wear. The Plaza is great for hanging out and people watching, especially when it becomes an ice rink in the winter (this is a great place to come in January when the winter doldrums set in and you need a ""pick-me-up""; rates are even usually lower at that time, too!) The Living Room is fun to have one last drink before heading up to the room. The rooms have spectacular views are creatively designed and are comfortable and clean. Our favorite is the Liberty Corner King (we've never stayed in a regular room but I've peeked in and they look nice) for its space and views. And if you want to splurge for a special occasion, book the Hudson Studio Suite (our last stay) but be forewarned it's not for the faint of heart-the tub and shower are in the middle of the room but WOW-it's spectacular, oh, the views! I really can't say enough good things about The Standard. Andre Balazs you are a genius. I did note that a reviewer said it could be noisy and I will say it IS noisy because you can really hear the action on the street so if that bothers you (not me), you might want to reconsider. In my opinion, that would be a mistake. You would miss out on all The Standard has to offer.","New Jersey, USA",0,5.0

The public areas, restaurants and lounges are very good, beautifully decorated with interesting and tasty offerings. Our room really should be called a capsule -- and is really designed for people who are busy enjoying the shopping and night life and not spending more than the minimum amount of time in the room. Not much room to move. The bathtub is couple sized and the view from the tub of the New York skyline makes for a memorable experience. There is no shower enclosure, so water goes all over the bathroom - personal injury lawyers must have a field day! Aside from the small size, which for a small amount of time is survivable my only knock was the bed and TV placement. The bed is very low and up against the wall. One partner has to crawl over the other to get out - which can have its upsides. Their is a generous flat screen TV at the foot of the bed, but it blocks the stunning views of New York, which is really too bad.The location is the main reason to visit this hotel. Built over the High Line linear park, there is great shopping, dining, and clubs are an easy stumble from the hotel..

Infused with light, the room is both retro and modern. Bed and linens were supremely comfortable, and the perspective on the river, the High Line, and the city just can't be beat. Best bathtub ever, roomy and with louver wooden blinds for privacy or looking out, just added to the ambiance.

The room made me want to move in, peek-a-boo shower facing the glass wall and all. (My partner sighed a little over the placement of the TV, though: foot of the bed, blocking some view). The queen bed was low and comfortable. The table and seating, inviting. The tub, worth two soaks in a single night stay. The shower, with half blinds tilted, luxurious.

Curious if there were more, i lifted the mattress to inspect. Every crevice of the mattress had these small bugs that remind me very much of those bugs that bite you in your sleep crawling around. It reminded me of what happens when you kick over an ant pile and all the ants scurry to the surface. Shaking with disgust, I quickly put my bags outside the room so none of my personal items got infested. I then went back in the room for further investigation to find a significantly large quantity of dead bugs surrounding the edge of the mattress frame and in the corner of the room next to the bed. Now...of course the hotel was very quick to inform me that they were not the bedbugs that every hotel in NYC fears. Any hotel in the country is going to deny having bed bugs because it would be bad for business. Letting the public know they have a bed bug problem would be committing hospitality suicide. They told me they were beetles. They were bed beetles that look exactly like every bed bug image I could find on the internet. They looked like every image I could find from the Cimicidae bug family, which are the small wingless insects that feed by hematophagy - exclusively on the blood of warm blooded-animals. As we are warm-blooded animals, we are ideal hosts for them. So, What happened next?All of my stuff is sitting in the lobby and I end up waiting an hour for the manager to come out and chat. They eventually gave me an upgrade to a larger room that they promised was not infested with bugs. However, I ended up simply leaving the hotel. A larger room is not going to help me sleep better at the Standard High Line. Knowing that the hotel is bug free during my stay is what I wanted. With the amount of bugs I saw after lifting the mattress, I would have been eaten alive if I stayed there one night. Fun place to have a drink, maybe.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",7,1.0

As a downtown girl, who travels around the world manically, I fully endorse this hotel. For location, variety, convenience, service and comfort. Also, for the most thoughtfully-compiled mini bar I've ever seen!I'm not big on review sites either, but felt the need to quell some of the reviews I've seen about snooty service etc. I was well looked after by wonderful staff who are super friendly and ever-helpful. From the cleaning ladies to the management - I really felt at home. In particular, Andrea at the front desk was incredible! She helped me repeatedly over my stay and was really front-footed about finding solutions for any of my queries. More importantly, she's ultra professional while being so friendly. I'm sad to have left without seeing her. What's the protocol for tipping the front desk?!Joel who assisted me with my luggage both when I checked in and out was extremely lovely. A complete gent, he wouldn't even let me help so much as to hold the door while he loaded my 2-weeks' worth of luggage!

This surely has to be a health hazard of the highest order and an inspection by New York Health Officials is in order before someone gets sick...The restaurant downstairs for breakfast is appalling, having been sat down the waiter basically flitted around like a princess for ages, then finally dropped a menu on the table saying he would be back soon. Some 20 minutes later, no water, no service I had to ask the restaurant desk for service. Finally the waiter came back with a huge attitude. I asked what had happened and mentioned that I had not even received any water, the waiter then rolled his eyes and then stared at the bottle of water and said well there it is... Unbelievable attitude from an obvious drama queen who should not be serving the public. General attitude from staff very, very poor, with most of them transfixed by a deluded notion that they are somehow uber cool... In fact far from it, ignorance and bad service despite working in New York does not make one hip...

I travel 80% of my time and am very familiar with proper hotel protocol for handling these situations. When I asked to speak to the manager he claimed there wasn't one on duty.

Our son explained the hotel as a building on stilts that sits above the wonderful high line trail. The room was small and expensive but well designed with great views of the river and skyline. Unfortunantly, the hot tub and roof top terrace were closed for renovations. That should have been pointed out to us when making reservations. The fitness center had great views and good equipment. The restaurants at the base of the hotel are nice but pricey. A small cup of ""warm"" decaf will cost you $5.50 and the servers are a bit too cool for me. We loved the bier garten that rests under the high line as it has energy and historic ambiance and good pretzels. The hotel is convenient to the subway, shopping, clubs and restaurants. We found a park blocks away for our son to play basketball. The lobby design was interesting but needs an update and seems a little tired even though it makes a vogue statement. The bellhops were great and informative about the surroundings but the hotel would benefit from supplying a concierge. We had questions that could not be answered about locations in the city.

There were several circumstances in which their customer service was absolutely outstanding that I would like to share.Upon check in, Joel took my car and luggage for valet. He was friendly and polite. We checked in with Kevin, our concierge, who was extremely gracious and was able to move us into another room that was on the floor I wanted and had the view I desired. Immediately after we checked in, Joel escorted us and our bags up to our room, and gave us a wealth of information concerning the room, the hotel, and the area. He also gave concise and honest answers to the extra questions that I had!A few moments after arriving to my room, I got a call from valet that my car battery had died before being taken to the garage. I was mortified, but all of the staff was very nice and completely non-judgmental about it. Paul, the customer service manager and Joel, the customer service rep/valet, took good care of me and my vehicle and even allowed me to return to my room to wait for roadside assistance instead of asking me to wait by the car, which I appreciated greatly, as I had just had a long drive in and really wanted to freshen up a bit. Once the car had been jumped they were additionally gracious about watching the car while it ran for a bit to charge the battery before taking it to the garage, which allowed us to go get a bite to eat. This is customer service above and beyond an exceptional level.Additionally I would like to mention that I found the state of the room to be exceptional. The cleaning staff should also be given due credit for their flawless attention to detail. There was not a speck of dust to be found anywhere, including the myriad of reflective and glossy surfaces or on any of the high points, such as the top edges of mirrors, furniture, or door frames. All of the linens, including curtains, smelled fresh and were in good repair. Nothing was broken and there was very little sign of wear on the flooring or any of the furniture. The literature provided about the room and the hotel was neat and concise, and the collection of complimentary magazines was impressive. And that mini-bar, what a fantastic selection! Unfortunately, a circumstance unrelated to the hotel necessitated my moving out of the room I was sharing into my own room in the wee hours of the night. I called the front desk, quickly explained the situation and requested to be put in a room by myself. Once again, I was completely mortified, but the staff was incredible about it. They even applied a small discount to the rate, which, as this was an unexpected expense, I appreciated enormously. The front desk was quick to resolve the issue and assisted me in relocating my items to a new room. The new room was in great condition and I was able to get some rest and straighten my head out after an upsetting situation.When I checked out the next morning, valet was extremely quick in retrieving my car and in helping me load my bags.All in all, despite two mortifying moments, my stay at The Standard exceeded all of my expectations and this experience lays heavily in the hands of their generous, compassionate, down-to-earth, and understanding staff. FYI: Yes, the rooms are small, but that didn't bother me one bit. If you're sharing a room with someone whom you aren't especially comfortable or open with, be prepared to send the person out of the room when you want to use those areas, because there is a separate WC but hte shower, bath, and sink areas are open to the bedroom/sitting area. I relocated to another room because my traveling companion was annoying me, not because of the room size or quality.Definitely stay here.

Normally, hotel checkin is between 2-3pm. We arrived at 3:15 and were told the room wasn't ready yet, but it would just be a couple minutes. Half an hour later we finally got to our room, and were promised that the luggage was already there; no such luck. After 2 phone calls to the front desk amd 20 minutes later, the luggage finally arrived. (Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me too much, but the wedding shuttle was leaving at 4:30 and we needed the suitcases to finish getting ready). In the end, we made it to the shuttle, but just in time. The hotel decor is very trendy, hipster. The room was clean and a decent size. There are a lot of ammentities at the hotel. While we didn't find the service to be great overall, there were two people who really stood out and were quite helpful - the bellhop and the night doorman. When the bellhop brought our luggage up, he was very friendly and hospitable. We ended up needing a taxi to NJ rather late in the evening and the doorman was fantastic! He went out and did his best to get us a fair taxi ride. ",USA,49,3.0

Initial impression was that of a great location,a smiling young woman to greet us, big windows for the big views... then you spend the first night there. We arrived on a Thursday, promptly served at front desk, went up to our room.It's quite small, BUT that's easily made up by the really large windows floor to ceiling!It is pretty much an all in one room, open space concept to the shower, bath and sink, one little door for one little (and I mean little) room with a toilette. This open concept may be the problem with what we found next. Mould. In the main grill that circulates the air in the room, we found mould, and could see that there had been more but it had been scrapped off. When we later took a shower we realized why. The entire room gets fogged up, there are three or four mirrors, but you can't use any of them for 15 to 20 minutes after a shower because of all the humidity. So this is a clear source for the mould. The first morning of our stay, having put the ""do not disturb"" sign on our door we were having a romantic moment at 10am, when there was a knock, and very quickly afterwards, the door opened... I was incensed, I just could believe it. Holding a pillow in front of my manhood, I asked her to please close the door... Later that day a friend delivered a dress to the front desk, for an event we were attending. When we asked for it we were told it wasn't there, they couldn't find it... Finally at 12:45, they called us to tell us they had indeed found it... It was there in a green bag, as indicated, AND the name and room number were on it. One more ""service"" specific issue occured: There was a wedding party done in the lobby and in front of the hotel on Saturday at mid day. They were preparing to take a picture in front of the hotel, next to this funky statue, and they were told by staff that they couldn't take a picture there... The bride lost it a little telling them that she had a very expensive suite at the hotel, and she was pissed that they wouldn't even let her take a damn picture in front. I just think it's stupid, and a missing out on marketing... It's a wedding photo, will live on forever, and you don't let them take the pic in front of your business... That's marketing you can't buy!! Last comment, don't go to this hotel if you want to sleep well. The beds are comfortable, HOWEVER, there is a club at the top of the hotel, AND below you at street level with a nice big terrace, so the base is pounding all night long, and the other guests are hooping and hollering in the hallways as they come home. There you have it, sorry for being negative, but there's nothing worse then having service issues when at a nice expensive hotel. The service should be beyond reproach.","Montreal, Quebec",129,2.0

This was our fourth trip to NYC in the past seven years. On previous trips we always stayed on the Upper EastSide or Midtown, but this time we were looking to stay in a new area. I found a pretty good deal on Jettsetter.com (Gilt.com's travel website). It was one of their ""Flash Sales"" which means the price is even lower than normal but usually only lasts for three to four days. The only drawback is that you do have to prepay (no refunds) so be sure you are definitely going!!We really liked staying in the Meatpacking District.We found it close enough to leisurely walk through the West Village and even to Soho (though took the subway back). The A-C-E subway is two (longer) blocks away, but not too far and we often did not need to make any transfers, or at most just one. The Meatpacking was fairly quiet during the week, although more crowded on Saturday and Sunday. Also very close to Chelsea Market for early morning coffee/croissant or nighttime snack. Tons of restaurants and shopping right there. In addition, entrance to the Highline is around the corner for a nice morning walk, and we also had a nice walk along the Hudson River down to the World Trade Center site one morning.We booked the standard King room and it is quite large (and not just for NYC standards). There is a built in three-sided couch with large coffee table, so tons of space to store luggage and shopping bags =).The exterior wall is floor to ceiling windows with fabulous views and keeps the room bright and cheery. Our view was of the Hudson River. There is a sheer curtain or heavy curtain to close as needed.There were big mirrors in room and bathroom, plus a full length mirror in bathroom. The bathtub and shower are quite large - there are louvres to close off the shower/bath from the main room, but there is no door on the shower for privacy so be sure you are with someone you know really well!There is a separate toilet compartment and a sink with fairly good counter space to the right. There were always plenty of towels left for us, which I really appreciated. It was quite hot at the beginning of the week and we took showers twice a day.We stayed on the fourth floor but did not have any problem with street noise. Frankly the hotel is not located on a busy wide street - mostly busy for the club upstairs - but no cars driving by fast. We did have some noise from the Biergarten below but it was not music, just the din of people talking. We never had any problems falling asleep or being woken up in the middle of the night.We found the service to be very friendly and helpful. We ate breakfast one morning in the restaurant there and it was good, though standard breakfast fare. (I strongly recommend Mailiano's in Gramercy Park hotel for best breakfast or Locanda Verde in Greenwich hotel for great brunch).There were a few negatives. Wifi was free, which was nice, but a bit spotty sometimes. The closet was rather small, and half of it could only be used to hang shorter things, such as shirts because the fridge and safe were in the way for longer things.There were no drawers, just this small cabinet with two cubbies. I thought the finishes were not that great, and bathroom amenities not that plentiful, ie. no shower cap.Overall, we enjoyed our stay and if I could get another good rate I would stay here again.","Medford, Oregon",71,4.0

Heaps of party and beautiful people hanging around at all times of the day• The food at the standard grill is great, the service not so great• The location is good, if you want to be out of midtown and in the meatpacking district• The view of the high line from the full glass windows of the room is amazing. I could even catch a glimpse of the statue libertyNot so Good points about the hotel:-• Hotel staff service was somewhat lacking. From the housekeeping to the front desk. They weren’t rude, just rushed and uninterested. E.g asking for a showercap that took more than an hour to arrive. Like questioning that they missed out an item from my check out bill and got irritated glances instead. (and I thought honesty was a good trait) Was told they would email my final bill to me but I never received it. • The rooms were tiny and claustrophobic. • The rooms are not well maintained. • The interior décor (from the corridors to the hotel rooms and the toilets) made me think I was in a hospital. I am a huge fan of modern hotel rooms but this was just a bit too trendy and weird for my taste. • The mattress was really soft, bad back support • shower area had no door, so if you are here w friends, plan how you would have to leave the room whilst the other is showeringSummary : it was ok for an experience. But I am pretty sure I won’t return again. Tips : get a suite. The standard and deluxe rooms are really really tiny. And the wc feels like someone’s broom closet.","Singapore, Singapore",24,2.0

Not strangers to luxury hotels around the world, we were flabbergasted at how badly we were treated by staff who seem to be caught up in the be- cool thing. I must say the young guys helping with taxis and luggage were polite and helpful, check in staff too were polite, but after that it was downhill. I managed to be well ignored as I waited to get breakfast, there was always confusion, and not much attention. I ate there only twice out of seven days. Try getting into the upstairs bars, and there is little hope. Guest? Are you on a list? No effort to provide service . In fact we tried twice and were virtually abused by the caricatures guarding the doors. Clearly wrong age demographic, over fifty, and not cool enough.

Located between Chelsea and the West Village in the meat packing district, you have good restaurants, shops and bars all within a few blocks, and a cutting edge modern hotel that is actually a good value. You also have the High Line, a great community park created in an abandoned elevated train on the west side filled with urban sculpture and culture that still retains the breeze and the freshness of wildflowers strewn between the tracks.The room was great if you like the feel of a ship's cabin and aren't modest. Every inch of space is used and used well. The shower and deep tub are floor to ceiling glass that are open to the room and back up directly to the comfortable bed, so forget ordering room service if you aren't out of the bath and fully dressed! Also, the room only works for singles and couples as there are no rooms with two beds. The window is floor to ceiling glass, so the view is spectacular...if you're facing the right direction.The staff, like the neighborhood, is friendly, trendy and under thirty. The tiny lobby, granite front desks, common bathroom and elevators all have the feel of an existential blade runneresque movie made now that tries to capture a slightly weird world a century in the future. Example: the elevators have an inset flatscreen on each wall that continuously run a modern take film of ""Dante's Inferno"" using NYC streets, the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson. The eerie symphonic music matches the visuals. I liked it and I liked the hotel...but then, I enjoy the strange, the artistic and the slightly absurd. If you want to be near the museums, comfort, elegance and Central Park this is not it. If you want the trendy east side galleries or the theater district or mid-town this is not it. If you want a view of the Hudson and the High Line and something well priced that's modern with good food and service... you'll be very satisfied...If you like the Kardashians and if you tweet...you will love The Standard!

You could have laid on your bed and looked at Freedom Tower going up, but NO, you HAD to stare at that big black immovable TV.The bath plumbing was very suspect, bath water ran out while taking a soak, then made loud noises. Water flooded the bathroom floor after each shower, lucky plenty of towels soak it up.The most irritating thing for our stay was the fire alarm going off at 1.20am forcing us out of bed, absolutely no word from the front desk, even as we tried to call, then walking down 10 flights of stairs, and sitting in the lobby with a bunch of other confused people, only to be told not to make a fuss and it was a false alarm. Then to add insult to injury, fire alarm goes off AGAIN at 5.30 the next morning for no reason. Come to find out a disgruntled hotel guest was declined entrance into the snooty lounges at the top and decided to get revenge on all by setting off all the alarms. But I actually agree with the guest. We went up to the top lounges to look around, and because we are not young and beautiful, but we are paying 350 a night for privilege of the abuse, we get asked for our room keys and get a very disdainful attitude from all we pass. Sorry guys, but everyone gets old. The restaurant was equally disappointing. Everything we ordered they were 'out of', so we decided to get a craft beer, but none, and the waitress didnt bother to mention we could go to the beer garden next door and get one, being from out of town we were not aware there was one!

I've reviewed the L.A. Standard--and love it. But the New York Standard is on a whole other level. I spent two days there in June--and I CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK! Why?1) The views of the historic meatpacking district, NYC's skyline (including the new World Trade Tower), the Hudson river and the Jersey shoreline are EPIC!2) The FOOD is amazing--like all the food in New York! BUT--it's all at your finger tips. I had Mussels and Fries at ""The Grill"" that I wanted to take a bath in. Room service is 24/7 and reasonable, The BEIRGARTEN is so filled with hot beautiful people, I couldn't believe how good the beer was. THe wine patio was adorable and had yummy eats. I was bumned that the ""boom boom room"" on the roof was closed for a private party.3) The service made me feel really SPECIAL--and that's hard for a 40something on a budget in NYC. Before I was EVEN OUT OF THE CAB, an incredibly handsome valet had pulled my suitcase out of the trunk and was opening the car door for me. The front desk has HUGE smiles for me and were accommodating beyond belief.4) The SHEETS AND PILLOWS were ridiculous -- the softest I've ever put my head on.5) The shower and tub are SO SEXY.6) The room seems huge because of the floor to ceiling WINDOWS AND VIEWS.Do your research--but for my money, this is the best, funnest, and coolest place in the city.

Decided to do a staycation at The Standard over a weekend as it looked so fabulous when we were walking the High Line. Everyone in the hotel, staff and guest, was gorgeous. The hotel was too hip for words with lovely decor and the room was as promised - floor to ceiling windows with a fab view of the Hudson, overlooking part of the High Line. As you look out of the windows at the different times, the scene changes with the light. Location was great too, located near many eating places, an Apple store, Sephora, within walking distance of the subway and lots of shopping. The room was relatively small but I know I am paying for the view and hip factor. The only minus factor about the decor is the shower in the bathroom. The peekaboo design is great if you're there for a sexy weekend with your lover but might be awkward if you don't know your roommate too well and don't want to catch glimpses of him/her in the shower.

It is a seriously cool hotel, and the Boom Boom club on the roof is a top 5 NYC club. Our experience is that its a good place to go midweek, but avoid like the plague at the weekend, when the service takes a nose dive and you have to deal with the Boom Boom.At the weekend you can't get through to the concierge, you leave a message with reception to get something done, which is not done. Commitments are given to call back that don't happen. Pretty poor. Breakfast in the room is seriously over priced for mediocre standard.Also, I highly recommend not to stay in the top two floors (17,16) as the Boom Boom club more than lives up to its name, and ear plugs are not enough as the bass comes through the concrete frame of the building.Its a cool hotel, enjoy the diner belgian beer bar which are ace, and the amazing hotel bar, but learn how to play it or you'll end up with a bitter taste.","London, United Kingdom",7,3.0

The beds are SO comfortable you just melt into them and the enormous bath tub was a real treat, along with the rain shower. The only bad points were the service in the bar/restaurant on the ground floor - staff all had a little bit too much attitude and after waiting around to be given a menu (with several prompts) drinks took forever to arrive and were often wrong.

The Standard is in a great location; the meatpacking district is fun, the nightlife is unbeatable and it's right by the West Village with great restaurants (the meatpacking district has good restaurants too, but perhaps a little overrated and overpriced?)The vibe at The Standard is pretty distinctive. When i grabbed a cab to the airport on the last day, the cab driver asked if i were from California. He commented that only Californians stayed there (from the US), which I'd agree with...and add Euro and South American bro-types. You know what i mean, yes, you do. It can be a bit much walking through the lobby and past the restaurant on the sidewalk. Meat.Market. The view from the room though, is unbeatable- right above High Line Park; the park is one of my personal faves, and to look out the huge floor-to-ceiling windows every morning to see it was a treat. The room itself was bigger than i expected for a NYC hotel room. The bed, though, was probably the biggest disappointment- too soft and small; it was definitely Not a Queen as advertised. It was a full-size bed. I'm not always the pickiest when it comes to toiletries in hotels, but i have to say that the ones they provided in the communal bottles were NOT pleasant. I smelt like an herb garden my entire trip, and not in a good way. whatever toiletries they used, it made me feel like I'd been rolling around in the grass. Big communal bottles = good (less waste). Smell and quality of toiletries = Not good. I hope they do something about that.

If that's what you're looking for, you'll LOVE it. If not - you might get annoyed.The lobby elevators are separated at night so only two remain for the hotel guests - the others are for those going up to the top floor club/bar. Kinda think they could get away with just one elevator for the bar/club and keep the hotel guests happy.Cons:The rooms were small.Weird open shower separate from main bathroom - had no light and poor drainage (ours leaked onto the carpet).Funky fitout - but poorly put together.The whole room was on a slant (engineering came up to address our concerns, didn't believe us until they brought a leveller up and saw we were right). Front desk were extremely accommodating and moved us immediately - unfortunately to the very same room just one floor down and the problem as the same. Engineering were happy to fix the bed so it wasn't on an angle so at least sleeping was OK.Pros:GREAT location. We do a lot of shopping in/around Meatpacking so it was perfect.Service from all hotel staff was exquisite. Not restaurant staff, though.Gym was pretty cool - certainly adequate for a 5 night stay.Pretty cool for people/celebrity spotting.Happy we scratched the itch and stayed here but wouldn't stay again.",Australia,56,3.0

We had some granola fall to the carpet on day 4 and by day 7 there was still a significant amount showing the housekeeping quality. My wife also got out of the shower one morning to find no towels other than hand towels. The bell guys were all nice but the desk staff are snotty and arrogant. They care so little about the quality of peoples stays that they never even asked on checkout how it was. One guy asked for an unbrella and was curtly told there were none but when he kept hounding the girl at the desk she finally walked 5 feet to get one and told him"" your lucky this is the last one"".

Great views towards the Statue of Liberty, and over a small section of the Highline. Although fairly compact was very well designed so never felt cramped.

Everything was clean, and the linens were lovely. There was a bit more wear and tear on some surfaces, but not dirty, just well used.It would be easy to say the staff wasn't up to scratch as many of the reviews do, but honestly, on the whole I was pretty happy. The front desk staff were a bit too-cool-for-school... not rude, just a tad disinterested. Bell boys were great. Standard Grill staff were lovely.

Some of them have really odd layouts though with no closets or really tight shower spaces. The views from the rooms are fantastic, almost worth the price in itself.The main drawback I have of the hotel is that it essentially turns into a club around 8pm. There's a few rooftop bars and clubs so as a guest you're battling all sorts of people for the elevators and lobby.

I came back because the rooms are great and the view is amazing. And I would come back again for those reasons. However, what was a bad experience this time was when I wanted to join my friends/colleagues (also residents in the hotel) in the rooftop bar. I had just ordered a drink from the ground floor bar which I brought up. The bouncer didn't let me in the rooftop bar with my drink as the bars were ""different entities"". My friends had drinks from that bar so they couldn't come down with me and I couldn't come in with my drink. So his ""solution"" was that I could drink it before entering (it was a full drink so either I would dunk it down all at once or drink it in 5 or so minutes) or leave the drink behind and order a new one. This was outrageous. How could I know this was a different entity? Was it not normal that I wanted to join my friends? And the guy was just rude about it - didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.That evening our group wanted to go to the rooftop bar for drinks but after 11pm residents weren't allowed unless you were on ""the list"". Again, the reason was that it was a different entity form the hotel. This is not great customer service - especially for such a high class hotel.

After my fifth stay at the Standard hotel in NY, things just seem to continue to be going downhill. When the Standard opened, it was a art induced, well polished property that supermodels and profitable artists flocked to. The service has never been good.. it has actually always been pretty horrible.. but at least it looked good. Now not so much. The hotel is prematurely aging. As soon as you get out of your cab you can see the worn bright yellow paint and the weathered doors. The white structure in the lobby has turned a dirty grey. The Marco Brambilla video art in the elevator, something everyone should see, suffers from neglect with dirty screens and dust and debris covering the mirrors that are part of the experience. Speaking of the elevators, our entire stay only one elevator was working so waits were 10-15 minutes and when you did get one.. it was a sardine can. If you had your bags with you.. wait 30 minutes till you find a elevator that has room. One morning we woke up to brown water coming through the taps that was excused as "" routine maintenance "" . On the weekend.. stay away from a room anywhere within 5 floors of the"" boom boom room night club. "" It is called boom boom for a reason and they have no probleming shaking the whole building till 4am.

I don't know how Andres ( the owner ) can put up with such a horrible group of management. Lost reservations, staff that doesn't care and make you feel like a welcome visitor but more like a nuisance. Staff walking in on rooms without knocking that have do not disturb signs.

I'd stay here again, sure, but this time I wouldn't be expecting great service and I certainly won't be expecting there to be any perks for guests of the hotel.","London, United Kingdom",23,3.0

We found ourselves robbed of our possessions, our time and expectation of decent service. Our evening started with a 7 course tasting menu with wine parings at one of the top restaurants in NY. The magical evening came to a screeching halt once we arrived at this hotel. One of our guests had his wallet stolen from his room, and another's purse was taken from the bar. Our guest was actually encouraged not to report this loss to the police by hotel security We were told that the Boom Boom room was private however they were willing to accomodate us for an $8,000.00 minimum. We were directed to the other club, Le Bain, and met by a flamboyant door man who first publicly chastised a patron for speaking when he was speaking and then informed us that it was also private and you must be on the list. When we stated that his counterpart at the Boom Boom room directed us there he responded: 'That is a miscommunication. It happens here all the time'. Another friend had a birthday the next day, and we hosted a brunch at the Standard Grill. We were served by a woman who was clearly new and struggling, it took 40 minutes to get our drinks and the manager had to intervene to get our order correct. We witnessed the poor woman pounding on the register trying to enter our food order, which arrived more than an hour after we did. Despite the fact that we had ordered an elaborate birthday cake, she took dessert orders from all our guests, then put out plates for the cake, which her colleague had to remove when the cake was cut in the kitchen. The final insult- 45 minutes to get out car from valet. That seems 'Standard' by the way- we were told that it was an external lot that serves three other hotels. I concur with other reviews. The rooms are chic, but poorly designed. Our shower/bath area had no door so it can be fully viewed from the front door when room service arrives. Apart from a few small shelves in the closet, there is no space to put clothing in the room. Overall we were disappointed by this hotel and embarrassed as hosts.","Greenwich, Connecticut",69,2.0

And the standard offers value in some areas: the area is the place-to-be, the views of Hudson River, the statue of liberty, the skyline and the high-line are beautiful. Now the downsights which we experienced during our 3-night stay. Check-in time 3 p.m. - quite late in the day anyway. When we arrived at 3.10 to check in, we were told that there are some problems with our room on 15th floor (we had booked one on the upper floors) to be ready as the hotel was fully booked last night. We were asked to wait half an hour and were offered a drink at the bar. Nice, but not what we wanted. After 40 minutes, we were told that the room had technical issues and that we might get another one, unfortunately only on 7th floor. To make a long story short- at 5 p.m., we and our luggage were finally in our room which was very small but with nice views and a comfy bed. The manager called later to apologize and offered a 30 $ breakfast voucher which he would put on the room. He did not, we are now struggling to get this settled after our return. The staff at reception is quite arrogant, you can easily feel that they are 'too cool to be really kind' and that they do not really care nor listen; the lady at the check out was not able to remember our room number and we had to tell her four times within five minutes.... another strange feature is the famous boom boom room. We understood that it is a super important VIP place and on our first night, it was entirely closed due to an HBO party. But the way the staff communicates with their paying guests is quite hilarious -'do not try to get up to 18th floor today, it is private, do not pretend to get up there, bla bla..."" sounds like the Secret Service protecting the President of the United States!! It's just a BAR, for god's sake! We went up one night when it was open for 'normal' people and yes, the place is great and the views amazing, but two drinks cost you 44$ and it's a show-off place, an interesting experience, but no food for soul. Would we come back to this hotel? Maybe not.

The staff on check-in were very friendly, helpful, and welcoming, letting you know about all the hotel facilities and services. The lifts are an experience in themselves that I won't spoil!My room, Standard King, was clean and spacious. As mentioned in other reviews, there is not much storage space in the wardrobe, but it was no problem for me for a few days. The mini-bar had a large and varied selection, and the bathroom products were nice. Although there didn't seem to be any shower gel, just bubble bath. Speaking of the bath, it was way too big and an odd shape, so stick to showers! The lights in my bathroom didn't seem to be working, but as the room is quite 'open-plan', it wasn't really a problem. The pane of glass between the shower and bed does mean, if you are with a partner, they would be able to see you in there - it's not frosted, there was no blind, so if you are not comfortable with that, maybe something to think about. The bed was large and very comfortable, and the TV was great with a good selection of channels. Also a nice seating area with a table. Nice views from my room of the Empire State Building. I ordered room service breakfast on two days. First day - omlette. It was very buttery, and I couldn't finish it. But the English Breakfast tea was very good. Second day - continental breakfast which was very nice. I ate in the grill one evening, and the food was okay - I'm not sure I made a very good choice. Everyone's elses looked a lot better. Slightly on the pricey side. Wine was good and they had a good selection. The beer garden is a nice place for a beer in the sun. Location is good, lots of nice restaurants and some bars, shopping and the High Line park, which is a lovely walk. Short walk to the nearest subway station, and taxis are available at the front of the hotel. Overall I would say this is a trendy place, good for young travellers or any people enjoying the nightlife. Not for someone looking for a quiet hotel experience.

All i have to say is do Not believe the bad reviews but indeed believe the hype because it is validated. Upon picking a hotel, i came across certain reviews that the staff were obnoxious, rude, not helpful and that the noise from the club on the 18th floor could be heard throughout the whole hotel. One word Ridiculous. I found the hotel absolutely amazing in every which way. The staff were incredibly friendly and all my requests were met fully without any problems. From the receptionist to the bell boys to the waiters, everyone smiled and was more than willing to help. The food at the standard grill which is where we had breakfast everyday was excellent, and this is noticeable from the amount of people who are not residents at the hotel who come to the standard grill for brunch or dinner. The room was very clean, the bed very comfortable and the room had a lovely fresh smell. And of course the view, floor to ceiling windows, truly breath taking. location is great bang in the heart of the meat packing district and easy access to the high line. The rooms are slightly on the small side but bear in mind your in New York, and the drinks in the bar on the 18th floor despite the amazing view which u have from ur room anyway are very overpriced. I don't usually write reviews but felt i had to this time as i spent allot of time in deciding what hotel to stay at, and i came across certain points that people complained about.

We chose to stay at The Standard Hotel in the Meatpacking district in NYC. From our first arrival we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who immediately did her best to try to find us a nicer room than the one that was reserved for us. While the new room was being cleaned she treated us to a complementary cocktail at the bar. When we got a chance to go up to our room (the elevators are wild by the way) we found the minimalist style and use of space to be quaint and attractive. The views of the High Line and the Hudson were breath taking. Although we didn't spend much time in the lounge on the 18th floor it was incredible. Awesome views of both downtown and uptown. It was classy and elegant without being stuffy. We should have stayed awhile but we were meeting guest.Altogether this was a great experience and one I will be looking forward to having again.

The exposed shower leaked onto the carpet in the hallway - we had to build a dyke of towels to contain the water. The toilet room was far away from the bathroom. To get to one side of the bed you had to navigate a maze of furniture, the tv and other obstacles - finally stepping over the bed.

The design of the rooms is more like a cabin than a hotel room. It's like a talented first year interior design project, where the student is redesigning your life without having actually lived yet themselves: no door on bathroom, bed has only one side and has a personality disorder (""am I couch? Am I bed?""). Some of the finishes are so experimental that they are delaminating pretty quickly (car trim sits uncomfortably on timber wall panel with embarrassing gap). There were numerous moments like this of material failure.The hotel is really a party place and if you want a nice nights sleep, don't think of staying above the 8th floor, due to the Boom Boom night club mentioned in other reviews. It really seems like a place for a single person or a bucks weekend for people with too much money. It should be noted that when we decided to leave, the staff were very helpful and sympathetic.

Not by the location, which was fabulous, nor by the view from our room, which was also great. But pretty much by all the rest. Before we arrived we had asked to concierge to book a few restaurants for us. For one of the reservations (which the hotel had confirmed) we arrived at the restaurant only to find it was closed.... The staff weren't particularly apologetic, nor did they seem to care. On a different occasion we decided to visit the hotel bar. The bouncer refused to let my husband in, because he judged his pants to be inappropriate... Not a pair of worn-out corduroys, mind you, but designer pants bought in Japan. Surely trendy enough for the vortex of cool and hip that is the Standard?? Apparently not. After arguing with him for a while, my husband returned to the room to change and I went in to order some drinks. By this time the bar refused to serve me, because it was too close to their closing time (which was around 10pm) and sent me to the adjoining bar. They in turn refused to let me in, because they were having a private function. I have never had so much trouble getting a drink in a hotel I was actually staying in. After negotiating with the young, pretty and not very friendly official guarding this entrance, she eventually allowed me in as far as the bar counter and kept a tight watch as I ordered our drinks and slunk off back to our room. We complained to management, who said they would send us complimentary drinks. These arrived almost 2 hours later. The mattress was soft, which didn't help a jetlagged back and the stay overall left us with a bad taste in the mouth. To end on a positive note, the video installations in the lifts were hypnotic (in a good way). Would I return? No.","Cape Town Central, South Africa",62,2.0

Love to start the evening in Bier Garten or at the Boom Boom Room. NY Strip @ Grille is always an experience itself and a late night signature cocktail at Boom Boom tips off an amazing night, even though we call it a standard night:) And when you wake the next day (perhaps with a heavy hangover) don't, for the love of God, miss the room service Standard Burger.

I'm a mother to 4 and a country bumpkin. I have labradors, live on a farm and I always seem to trail mud where ever I go. My husband had to go on a business trip to New York and I decided to join him. I saw a Lonely Planet magazine in the News Agent with New York on the cover. So I bought it. The New York they talked about was the rejuvenated meatpacking area and the High Line, a disused suspended railway line that used to service the meat industry and now has been reinvigorated by clever landscaping. Very interesting and away from the hustle and bustle that slightly freaks me out.There are many hotels in the area, but The Standard straddles the High Line! It's so cool and I was worried I would feel out of place. But no, when our taxi turned into the street outside the hotel, we were greeted by a very welcoming and friendly guy. Our check in was effortless and our trip in the lift to our room an experience. Our room was great and cosy, with views over Manhattan and the Hudson River. The mini bar was incredibly well stocked and the toiletries extremely generous and replenished on a daily basis. The Bar on the 18th floor is unmissable and has one of the best views around. A trip to the loo is also a must!Breakfast was really good as well, a good mixture of really healthy, Ok for you and down right unhealthy. Fresh juices!!

This is for the perpetually un-hip like myself. If someone asks you ""Why is the hotel logo upside down?"" and you first thought IS NOT ""Isn't it obvious?"", then this review is for you.I stayed here for a recent business trip and the first indication that I was out of my element was that I walked around the hotel, not once, but TWICE trying to find the entrance. Eventually, I found it - to spare yourself the trouble, look for the unmarked yellow revolving door.Inside you will find the trappings of a modern, trendy hotel from the stylish lobby to the ""heaven and hell"" montages in the elevator. There is also an attached lounge (nice for a nightcap on those cold winter nights), beer garden and associated restaurant (the Standard Grill). There is a well-equipped gym on the 17th floor with excellent views of the city.My room was on the small side but well organized with a queen bed and room for a small couch and desk (yes, there aren't many outlets but they are there, mostly hidden behind furniture). There is also free Wi-Fi, a must for any business stay. Note the beds tend to be low so take that into account if you are used to a more elevated sleeping experience. Taking a cue from the modern hotels in Europe, the room features an open bathroom that opens right into the main room, I guess for all the voyeurs out there. It did feature a large garden tub which is a welcome addition to any hotel room.Not sure if this is the same in all the rooms but my bathroom area was elevated - if you weren't paying attention you could easily take a header onto the tile floor. Of course, the best feature of the room (and probably the reason you will want to book here) is for the floor to ceiling windows with magnificent views of NY city and the Hudson. NY has an amazing skyline day or night and especially at elevation. Those same windows seem to have attracted some exhibitionists who have performed free but most likely unwelcome ""shows"" to the chagrin of the people strolling along the High Line (this is the park that has been built on an old elevated railway line which cuts through the Standard). However, that practice is now frowned upon as noted by the message from management to be aware of the transparency of the windows.The service here is friendly and unassuming and I would rate that part highly. Things get taken care without much fuss - the rooms getting cleaned and the mini-bar refreshed seemingly on their own. Other reviewers have commented on the lack of access to the club on the top floor. This is true - you can use it before 10pm but afterwards, if you are un-hip like me, you will be turned away at the door. But that's OK - you haven't had an authentic NY experience unless you've been turned away at the door somewhere so check that off your list!So most likely you heard of this hotel since it was recommended by your more trendy friends. You will end up going if you want to experience a stylish hotel in a fashionable neighborhood with incredible views of the city and exceptional service and are willing to be a fish out of water for a wild, noisy, disorienting weekend and mingle with club kids, trendy locals and jet setting European tourists.","San Francisco, California",74,4.0

This hotel is completely out of our budget for a reason, they treat you like you're special. The best part is, they make you believe it. We were greeted at their lobby by some of the coolest, good looking and friendly staff I've ever come across. The Standard lobby had an atmosphere that some of New York's best clubs can't even rival.  The room was sick. Unbelievable view of the Hudson with an excellent front-row seat of sunsets that fall behind the buildings on the water's edge. The bath was outstanding and a great centerpiece to the room. There are only a few bad things I could say about the room and the hotel, what's up with the toiletries? To throw down that kind of cash, you think you'd get some exotic and extravagant soaps and shampoos to douse yourself with. Bring your own hair tonic, the stock toiletries are way below standard. The restaurants were outstanding. Breakfast at the grill was excellent and very relaxing. The bar next to the lobby seemed to have people 24 hours a day, it was very chill and relaxed. The restaurant behind the grill was very cool, dimly lit with a strong crowd all day and night. The beer hall was way sick. Ping pong tables, a big bar, mess-hall style table layout. Legit. Location, location, location. Right around the hotel is a bunch of boutiquey select shops. The hotel itself sits over the old train tracks converted into a walkway. A quick 5 minute walk north on this and you're at Chelsea Marktet. Train stations are also abundant, I think there were two choices putting you about a 10 minute train ride from anywhere you wanted to get in the city. If you need to do a taxi, you're pretty set too. We got a $25 taxi from the LES and a $60 ride to and from JFK. You're also just a 10 minute walk from the West Village, if you go there, hit up a place called the Spotted Pig.  Overall, outstanding stay and a perfect compliment to a trip to the best city in the world. This could be the best hotel we have and may ever stay at. Might have to save up and do it again.

I previously stayed at the Gansevoort hotel nearby, and thought that this would be a better alternative. The lobby is cool, and checkin was quick and friendly (not as pretentious like the average W hotel). The rooms are very small, but this isn't a problem due to a clever layout, big windows, lighting, and mirrors. The design reminds me a bit of a youth hostel, however if you have enough of over designed hotels, then it's is refreshingly simple and functional. The first room (1509) had a very loud ventilation, however the second room (1701) was even worse. Since it was windy outside, somehow some flaps in the ventilation system made a loud hammering noise that prevented me from sleeping. Was too tired to change it again. I had dinner at the Standard Grill (my second visit, just ok as they barbecued the scallops without any spices or seasoning, the worst scallops in a long time, and the most expensive, too). The bar at the 18th floor is phantastic, cool design, good crowd, great view. Since I left at 6:00 am next morning I placed an order for room service breakfast at 5:00. I was informed that room service won't start until 6:00, despite being told at checkin that they have 24 hour room service. They finally agreed that they could only do an omelette with a filling different to what I ordered (god knows why), however finally delivered the omelette I had originally ordered. The coffee was on the house for the trouble caused (however without spoon to stir the sugar). Still better choice than the Gansevoort, but wouldn't return.","Munich, Germany",99,2.0

Your neighbours arriving from the local chill-out lounges will ensure you hear the continuation of their party, hours after the party is over...3) the design of the ""wet shower"" will ensure that you, and all of your toiletries, are just that: wet. The sinks were bought on the cheap and don't drain properly. Wait til you see where they put the large screen TV's - smack dead in the middle of your expensive Manhattan skyline view (corner room). There's no exhaust fan in the toilet ""cabin"". That said, whoever purchased the mattresses did well....4) ""room service"" lacks the ""service"" - coffee day one, 51 minutes flat and coffee day two was under 48 - so don't plan an early check-out.5) you can also forget a friendly welcome or special guest services - you need to book at the rooftop bar (no special contingency for hotel guests) and same at the restaurant (albeit there are plenty of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs in the area...see 2 above). The limos from Jersey pull up at all hours of the night and you'll hear the inebriated young Jersey girls on the high floors, as well as the low, too. Yes, all that entertainment from the quiet of your own room. Just don't expect the hotel staff to anticipate that you, too, might want a quiet nights sleep as your principle desire in a ""hotel"".6) in addition to the expected ""Manhattan drone"" of cars, horns and street-sounds which you'll hear at any NYC hotel, you can look forward to the semi-trucks arriving to the local meatpacking district meat-packers with their annoying ""beep-beep-beep"" reverse warning sirens just prior to the arrival of your neighbours from the after hours club (see 2 above). There are also major construction projects on both the north and south side of the hotel - the west rooms all overlook the westside highway (joy, zoom, joy, siren) and the east rooms are all corners - so there is no escape if you crave silence other than earplugs.7) I'm boring, you are too....so I'll stop here and let your imagination or high fill in any other details.",London,74,2.0

The rooms are smaller than the Gansevoort, but they are newer and quite comfortable (once you get over the fact that your room is exposed to the world via the floor-to-ceiling windows, that is). The bathrooms have glass walled showers that abut the bed and if you're staying here with someone you're quite intimate with, this can be fun. The shower has very good water pressure despite being one of those stupid ""rain shower"" heads. The one problem with the shower is that it is not enclosed so water that sprays off of you or the wall just pools up outside the shower soaking your bath mat. The sink in the bathroom is kind of silly form-over-function-esque but not nearly as foolish as those in the ""Dream Downtown"" rooms. Beds are comfortable, but unfortunately very low to the ground. I despise that trend in hotels. There is a built in ""couch"" and a small table to eat your unbelievably delicious room service on. That is something that should not be overlooked, by the way; the room service. It is the best I've had at any hotel, both in terms of food quality and the service itself. The staff are so nice and are always very prompt. The food, well, it's just incredible for room service. Do yourself a favor and order at least one meal from room service here. You won't regret it. The rooms have giant LG flat screen tvs mounted on the wall with difficult to use remote controls because of some inexplicable delay between the time you push a button when the tv reacts to that command. I have stayed here several times along with several colleagues in different rooms and it's the same for all of us every single time no matter what room we stay in. It's so strange. The front desk must get hundreds of calls a week about this awful inconvenience. The other bad thing about the Standard is the free wi-fi service. It is PAINFULLY slow because they want you pay $20 a day to upgrade to the faster connection. This is extremely frustrating, especially if you need the service for work. For a modern hotel, they sure do fail in the technology department. Overall, however, the Standard is an excellent hotel and one worth trying for business or pleasure.",Boston,52,4.0

This was my first time staying in the Meat Packing district and I absolutely loved it. About the hotel:--Stayed in a deluxe king, great view of the Hudson and the High Line path, decent size room, floor to wall windows, and huge tub if that is important to you. Also important to note: people can see into your room from down below e.g. windows are not privacy screened / darkened, so don't be thinking you can walk around your room in the buff without curtains drawn.--Top of the Standard: inside the hotel itself, the top floor bar with great views and really good vibe, go there before 9 or 9:30PM as it closes to the public and becomes an exclusive access type venue.--Staff: I had a great experience with the staff, everyone from door men to concierge to receptionist were super helpful and friendly.Although cabs are plentiful around here (there was always a line right outside the lobby waiting to go), the subway is only a couple blocks away. Super easy to get to all the points of interest around Manhattan.But before you venture out, spend some time in the surrounding neighborhood, as it has some great things to see / experience. There are too many to write but here are a few: --The High Line: nice, elevated walk way that was once a railroad line, great vantage points giving you a different view of the West side --Chelsea Market: super cool indoor market with a bunch of shops, primarily food (bakeries, coffee shops, lunch-type places) and grocery.--Shopping: lots of stores for either buying or browsing including Sephora, Diane Von Furstenburg, Vince, Tory Burch, etc..--Night time restaurants: We ate at one of several seemingly great options, Scarpetta (YUM italian), there is no need to travel far to get good grub, wether you want casual or a bit upscale. Neighboring Chelsea having a ton of great options.Definitely recommend.","New York City, New York",19,4.0

Very unexpected treat in Manhattan. -Overall the staff was very attentive and helpful, with one exception noted below.Cons:-The club on the 18th is an inconvenience to those staying at the hotel. The view is not as good as the rooms' (at least our room). The service is noticeably snobby and different from the other restaurants/bars in the hotel. The waitresses/hostesses are all waif-ish wannabe models waiting to be discovered and not so much interested in clearing tables, taking orders, etc. Also not a very good scene on the night we were there; lots of boys in hooded sweatshirts spending daddy's money.-The people walking the highline park can see in the rooms very clearly. And evidently (from friends with apartment nearby), it is a pastime for nearby residents to sit on their roofs with binoculars. Be warned! -There was construction going on in the floors above us from about 1030am - 430pm each day. We were not told at check-in and heard the details from another guest when my husband and I were talking in the elevator. I expect those kinds of details to be disclosed by the hotel staff.-The elevators are a little strange. Very dark with a photoshop video montage going on loop on two screens.

For a young guy like me, staying at this hotel is an experience. Given its Meatpacking location, this hotel attracts a very Euro crowd and is a very big hang out spot. The Top of the Standard is a must visit with its 360 views of NYC including the Hudson River, Financial District and up north towards Midtown. The rooms are for those couples seeking something new - full clear view floor to ceiling windows, open shower and tub, etc etc. I've stayed in the queen hudson room, king hudson view room and the terrace suite. Would highly recommend you go for a King room at the least.The main downside I know of at this hotel is that the front desk and concierge are essentially the same so on a busy check-in day, don't expect to get a pickup from concierge for reservations or recommendations. This hotel is the center of what's happening in NYC. Stay here if you are intending to have a big night out and not necessarily need to take a cab everywhere.

We spent 2 nights there recently and we were slightly disappointed in the rooms and service.The deluxe King is a closet and the space is weird. We knew that going in though. The bathroom is in middle of room with all glass and no doors...OK, I get the glass, but it was so cold and drafty you hated to take a shower. There was virtually no room for a waste basket in the bathroom and no hooks to hang towels. The room smelled of cigarette smoke. Waste baskets were dirty and the house keeping does just minimal cleanup during the daily cleaning....no wiping soap build up in shower and then some......the cleaning is just a touch up really but for the price you would think it should be more...maybe it's pride but I would make sure all my housekeeping staff really cleaned thoroughly. The view of Empire State Building was just OK...You really need to be on the highest floor for a better view and the hotel sits in an area that has a lot of buildings in front of it. Beds were great.As mentioned earlier, the Standard Grille is amazing...one of the coolest spots in NYC. It sits right in the Meat Packing District and right off the West side and a block away from the Hudson River. The food is always great at the Grille and one of our favorite brunch spots. If you are up for a fun loud beer garden, with so much to see...this is the spot. The winter ice rink looks real sweet with the warming house...will be back with my child.

We first stayed there when the hotel had their ""soft opening"" before the hotel was completely finished. Both stays were very good.The best thing about The Standard is that no matter what type of room you get, you won't ever have to look out your window at a brick wall or an air shaft. How many times have you stayed at a nice hotel known for its views and ended up in the a room that looks at a brick wall? No natural light or air, etc. The way The Standard is situated on its own block and the way it is designed makes that sad situation is an impossibility.The Room: For me the light and air (and views) and just the general feeling of coziness make up for any cons, but read on for the cons...Like most NYC hotel rooms, this one is definitely on the small side. We had two full size suit cases that we never really found a good place for. Small closet with a fabric curtain rather than a door. And the bed itself is flush against the bathroom wall on one side so only one sleeper has immediate access to the floor. There is a kind of swivel table/desk over near the fantastic floor to ceiling window wall that works quite well for work or for eating. Nice big flat screen. The bathroom is one of those open plan types with a gigantic glass window in the shower/tub that looks out into the room. It lets in lots of light to the bathroom but you have to make sure no one is using the shower when room service arrives. There is a separate room for the toilet itself. The tub/shower is enormous but the drain is right smack in the middle of the tub which can make it slightly awkward taking a shower or even a bath. The rain showerhead is nice but, again, like many hotels, if you are 6'2"" you have to bend a bit to fit under it.The Bed: On the softer side. We tend to like a firmer mattress and this one after four days had me pining for my bed at home. Linens and comforter were very cozy and clean. The Views and Location: Even the rooms that don't face the river still have river views. And your consolation is a superstar view of the sky line with the Empire State Building. If you have a room on the other side of the building you have to make do with a fantastic river/harbor view of the Statue of Liberty.Surrounded by pretty good upper end shopping and restaurants. Definitely an urban/warehouse feeling to the quickly gentrifying neighborhood and great proximity to the West Village as well as the parkway along the Hudson. Of course the hotel also straddles the fantastic High Line park which is a joy in itself, but also a great way to walk as far north as 30th Street without having to deal with cars. Service: Sometimes these hip hotels can make anyone who isn't a fashion model feel like an idiot. Not so at The Standard. Everyone we dealt with (with the possible exception of the excellent restaurant) was friendly and didn't throw of any kind of attitude. Room service was particularly good. My husband had a cold most of the time so we stayed in more than we would normally and I was always amazed at how fast the food came. From phone call to hot breakfast was only 15 minutes.Food: Room service food was good and fast. The Grill restaurant was comfy, had a great menu with lots of variety, and was really delicious. Lunch we could do as a walk-in, but evening meals require reservations well in advance--although they do take walk-ins even if you can't get a reservation.Amenities: The fitness center on the 17th floor was well-equipped, open 24/7, and had unbelieveable views. Room had a very well stocked mini-bar with reasonable-ish prices. Bathroom amenties are Kiss My Face and have a distinctive, not overpowering, clean smell. On demand choices on the flat screen were kind of on the lame side, not much choice, but the cable stations had more than your typical choices (like Bravo, etc.) but also had about five channels of art documentaries which were great. Free WiFi was plenty fast, but you could also upgrade for 19.95 a day for faster connection.The video art installation in each of the elevators was mesmerizing and made riding the elevator fun.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",62,5.0

We knew before heading to New York that we wanted to stay in the Meatpacking District and we had our eyes set on taking as many pictures as possible in the Highline Park. This hotel allowed us both. The service here was fantastic! From the minute our driver dropped us off on the curb to the minute we left, I felt special and appreciated. The concierge took our bags from the curb, brought us to check-in (where we were able to check in at 9 AM complete with a free room upgrade!) He brought our bags to our room, opened the curtains, gave us a little tour of the room, the mini-bar, etc. Told us the best places to eat and check out in the area, etc. The views from this hotel are sweeping. Aside from the fact that the hotel literally overlooks the Highline Park, we also had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. I was blown away! The rooms, however, while modern were a little dated. The bed was comfy, but the bedding needs to be updated. The bathroom, however, was great. I loved the rain shower. The hotel property overall is amazing though. Between the restaurant, bars, the coffee shop, and the little Octoberfest beer garden, we were pleasantly surprised with all of the choices right at our finger tips. The meat packing district was hip, trendy, and a great place for any 20+ year old to socialize and have fun. It was warm and mild the first week of October and all of the restaurants had outdoor patios and places to eat. We were surprised by the options in this neighborhood. It was clean and just had a great vibe to it! At times, in shorts and a hooded sweatshirt (I did feel a little under dressed). So plan accordingly (as NYC is where the fashion is made!) While you will probably pay a lot to stay here (we did) it was well worth the extra 100 dollars or so (especially after seeing some of the dark and dank hotels in Times Square that were only about 100 dollars less a night). If you are looking to be close to the Highline, want something trendy, and are looking for a great NYC neighborhood- I definitely recommend The Standard!","Seattle, Washington",68,4.0

The mid-price room was lovely. The GIANT bathtub was a virtually an in-room plunge pool. The view from my third floor room over the HighLine was superb - high enough to feel private, but low enough for amazing people watching. But the staff were just nasty. Check-in was frosty. Zero smiles. Minimal eye contact. And I had to ask where the elevators were, which is a) not obvious and b) added to a feeling of not being welcome. That first evening we had dinner and then returned late for a night cap. The bar was full, but the lobby area was empty. I asked in the bar if I could order drinks and take them to the lobby. The hostess said ""No. That's a LOBBY. This is BAR"". I had seen people hanging out in the lobby before, using the WiFi, sipping coffee etc. I decided to risk it, as I felt that I was paying enough to be able to use the facilities available. I asked for a cocktail menu and we sat in the lobby. I then saw that I'd been given a food menu. I went back and asked again for a cocktail menu. I was told I could order there and then. I did and told the hostess I'd be in the lobby. The drinks never came. Not a great beginning to a 5 night stay.",London,77,2.0

We stayed in one of the smaller queen rooms, albeit higher up and facing the Hudson – highly recommended. Small but perfectly formed and felt much larger due to brilliant design – stylish AND functional, with an entire wall for a window. Comfy bed, lovely shower, separate loo cubicle (much appreciated in such close quarters). The rest of the hotel is as good if not better. Super design, very well maintained, always buzzing with beautiful people (more Hollywood than NY), with excellent food and drink throughout. The Top of the Standard Bar is an absolute must: massive panoramic, insanely glamorous in a 1920s-on-acid style, with the best cocktails in town and that's saying something as this town is New York. Perfect brunches at the Standard Grill - or anytime eating, for that matter, though we only did mornings.One down side: our room on the 14th-floor suffered from clearly audible club music every day until the early hours.

The Standard is definitely as sleek as they come but still manages to feel warm and even a little homey. The building itself looks imposing and stark but there's a lot to be found on the ground floor. The Standard Grill and the Biergarten outside the hotel on street level are both amazing in their own distinct ambiance. The Biergarten especially has a very fun convivial atmosphere to it.The lobby is dark and trendy with beautiful staff to get you all checked in. Finding the elevators is a bit of a task but then you're on your way. I was fortunate enough to stay in a Deluxe King room that faced south. Walking into that room, you're immediately floored. The view is to die for through the complete wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. Just looking down on the High Line (a park created on miles of abandoned elevated train tracks) and the river and out at the city lights...I never wanted to leave my room.The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever encountered. And one of the best nights sleep I've had in recent memory. The only drawback to the room design is the open shower. It's so open air that even though the rainshower fixture keeps you soaked, it's easy to get chilled while you're showering. The seating area and table in the Deluxe room added even more space to a room that already feels grand due to those infamous windows.The neighborhood itself is chock full of activities for day and night, the High Line park, fabulous restaurants (see my other review of Spice Market), decadent bars and lounges, great shopping.

There is an iHome radio to charge and play your ipod or iphone songs. The view from our room was amazing with the floor to ceiling glass wall. We could see out to the Hudson River and at night the Empire State Building all lit up!! The bathroom is small as well, but laid out nicely. It would not be a place to stay with friends or kids. The shower wall is glass and it could be awkward share this private ritual with someone you are not very close with. There is a separate toilet area with a full door. Maid service was quick and efficient. We had drinks at the bar on the top floor of the hotel. The 360 degree view is amazing, you can see all of New York. The drinks are quite expensive, but it is NYC. ""Last call"" is at 9:30pm. Apparently, they make everyone leave and then it is open only to A List people after that. We also had drinks and appetizers at the Standard Bar and Grill. Great meat and cheese plate and drink selection. All typical New York prices. People have said that the elevators can be quite slow, and this is definitely true. We were on vacation though, so we weren't too worried about it.

We were told at check in that our credit card would be charged an additional $200 a night in case of any damage that may happen during our stay. I've never had this before and thought that this was a touch pretentious. When I got up to the room, I was generally underwhelmed. Considering that we had just been charged an additional $400 for the 2 night stay, I was disappointed to see that the furnishings were scrappy, all bashed up and marked. The dresser that held the minibar looked so tired and out of place. The wet room was awful, as it didn't drain properly, which meant that following your shower, 20 minutes later when you brush your teeth you're lucky not to break your neck on the slippery floor.I proposed earlier in the day to my girlfriend and so wanted to head up to the rooftop bar for a few cocktails to celebrate. Took the lift to the top to be told that we had to leave the hotel, and re-enter via the side entrance, where we had to present ID then have our hands stamped.

The room was really nicely done, with a great view, but it was on the small side, and the table/chair were too low to be called a desk so didn't make a great workstation.

Not to give away my age but this is the “hottest” hotel we’ve ever stayed in. I was a little apprehensive at first because of all the reviews I read which spoke about how rude the staff was. We had no such experience. We arrived here the Friday before Hurricane Irene. Both my wife and I were born and raised in NYC but now live in NJ. We wanted a quick weekend getaway and got a great deal on this hotel. We arrived by taxi around 1:30pm and the driver stopped pretty far away from the entrance. As I was paying him there was already a man taking our luggage out of the trunk. We weren’t sure who this guy was but It turns out that the bellhop (I think that’s what you call him) noticed the taxi and came right over. We were still apprehensive about check-in (once again from all the reviews) and walked inside to officially check-in. The front desk staffer was also no problem. As nice as can be. I’m only mentioning these things because I put a lot of faith in many of the reviews I read. I’m the type who does a lot of research before I travel so I’m letting you know that although some may have had bad experiences, be your own judge on this one. We were impressed with many facets of this hotel the service being one of them. The room key is not handed to you in a small folded piece of paper like many places but instead was in a small leather binder along with writing paper a pen and other pertinent hotel information. Even the elevator is hot. There is a weird montage playing on video monitors that you have to see to understand. We were staying in a deluxe room on the 10th floor. The hallways are clean and neat. When my wife got to the room all she could say was “wow”. What a view. The only down side was the size of the room. It was small but I’m sure if you could afford it you could get a much bigger room. The window went from ceiling to floor and took up an entire wall of the room to the right of our bed. You can see the world but there is a note on the table near the window reminding you that the world can also see you. There is a privacy curtain provided so that you don’t end up on YouTube. The bed was very low to the ground so if you have a hard time getting up and down from the floor you will not be able to get in and out of this bed. Fortunately both my wife and I are in good shape so no problems. One other draw back was no HBO on the TV. I thought that odd for a hotel of this caliber but this in no way diminished our experience. The shower is in the middle of the room and is see through so don’t share this room with anyone you don’t want seeing you nude. Overall the room was very clean though I did notice some signs of wear and tear. There is a very nicely stocked mini-bar which has decent prices for a mini-bar. They provided robes in the room which were also very nice and an umbrella for use in the event it rains.We had drinks on the rooftop where there is a cozy lounge area. Views of the city and NJ, the river, et… They have two small hot tubs along with a full service bar, crepe stand and comfortable seating. There were women in bikinis and guys in bathing suits. We enjoyed sitting up there taking in the views.On Friday evening we asked the concierge for information on good places to eat and not only did he recommend several options but even drew us a map and added some tips on how to get into some hard to get into places. Once again I only mention this because we were expecting a snobby attitude after reading reviews. Saturday Hurricane Irene decided to ruin our weekend getaway. The hotel was not in an evacuation zone so it was somewhat business as usual. We decided to check out anyway to be safe. If there was going to be snotty attitudes for sure we thought it would be today when employees had to work knowing there was soon to be no mass transit service. Not the case. Friendly as the day before. Overall, we absolutely loved this hotel (as if you couldn’t tell) and are planning to return again.","North NJ, USA",3,5.0

Through the revolving neon yellow doors you are pummeled into the dim, edgy reception area where anyone over 35 might feel a little outre.

Our total bill was well over $5000 for two nights for our rooms, F&B, etc., so our expectations were high. They were not met. My review will be about the Empire Suite.Check-inDespite having emailed ahead of time, my name was not added to the reservation made by my friend. I was told I would need to wait for 40 minutes for a meeting of hotel managers to end before checking into my suite, despite showing them the email confirming. When I checked in, finally, I was told that the room had mechanical issues. We waited until after 4:30, and eventually were checked-in. There were light fixtures in the room.Room serviceWe called several times the first night for turn-down service. They never came. When they cleaned the room the next morning, they changed the sheets etc., but never tied up. In any 5-star hotel I had stayed at, and any time I book a suite, the staff will tidy amenities, etc. At the Plaza, they will dry-clean/iron your clothes. Nothing.ClubWe reserved tables at Le Bain, the Standard's club. Despite having a reservation on my phone, again, when I arrived to check in, I was told I had no reservation. When I showed an email from the club's manager to the bouncer, the bouncer informed me that he was not sure who the manager was. After a few minutes, the situation cleared up and we were shown a table. The club was great, and our hostess was fantastic.General serviceSeveral times we called for Blackberry/iPad/iPod chargers and were told simply ""we do not have any."" A good hotel will either offer to buy them for you, or tell you where to get them. Nothing of the sort.The roomThe room was stylish with a fantstic view, but lacked expected amenities and several items were broken. The television in the dining room was broken, and would not turn on. The lighting panels in the bedroom and in the dining room were spotty at best. There was no automatic curtain system, so you literally had to step over couches, the hot tub, etc. to close the blinds in the room. The ""guest"" shower (the smaller of the two) had watermarks all over the glass and floor, indicating that it had not been thoroughly cleaned.In general, we were there for a good time, so we did not really care; however, for having the most expensive room in the place for several nights; for having spent thousands of dollars in the restaurant and bar, we expected much more. I will not stay at the Standard again. Now, about the positive:People: The staff, while sometimes unhelpful, are pleasant and stylishDesign: The hotel, while minimalist, is stylish and hipThe clubs: Can't be beat in NYC, though the Boom Boom Room was not openThe food: The F&B venues on-site are amazing, and the service 5-starThe location: Washington and 14.

We obtained a discount deal for the weekend and stayed in a basic room. The building hugs the high line and offers really wonderful views from any side of the building. I loved this aspect the most.Of the numerous social spaces, we liked the Living Room lounge the best. It allows you to take in the scene while relaxing in a quieter more chill space. The biergarten is cool too. We went to the rooftop on Saturday for Sunset Service and it was exactly what you'd expect it to be. Crowded, fashionable, chic and fun for a drink but not our scene :) But to some it will be wildly entertaining.The room was larger than I had anticipated. The bed very comfortable and the toiletries are of a good quality. Pulling back the curtains and taking in the scene below and far beyond motivated us to spend less time in our room -- a good thing.The staff were all excellent, though I did not interact with anyone during a high volume time. The weekend bellboy who seemed to be working all the time was totally awesome and always chatted with us and welcomed us back to the hotel. He was apologetic that our car took hours to be valet parked, and I trusted him completely. A great staff member (didn't get his name--- cool asian dude)Just a few other things to note--- the gym was awesome, so glad we were located near it. Great new equipment kept very well and with that outstanding view. Oh, and one tiny comment-- why no craft beer on any of the menus -- biergarten doesn't count.

Very comfortable and quiet. Amazing roof top and top floor venues.Neighborhood is fantastic - if not a bit remote.BUT I can assure you not everyone would feel comfortable here. Many rooms have a glass wall between the shower and the bedroom - might be awkward if sharing a room w/ your kids...or even for some couples. I would not suggest The Standard for people w/ kids anyway. The overall mood is party-trendy, not elegant comfort. My parents - and many of my peers - would not like this environment.

Easily The most comfortable and luxurious I have ever slept in. Secondly the staff particularity one of the conciererges Jesse. From our arrival Jesse made our stay an unforgettable one, he arranged reservations and great tables at some awesome restaurants, even planned a whole day of activities for us. I was blown away by his knowledge of the whole city. He was personable, efficient and very professional. And I thank him and the other front desk staff for such a wonderful experience. I see that many people comment about the hotel, I think it's peerfect for people of ages as long as they are willing to except that it's a very active hotel and a lot of people who take up the staffs time arent actually guests. One big downfall of the hotel is the lifts thursdsy , fri, sat and Sunday nights the lifts a filled with people goin up to the roof and drunk coming down, as a guest I found it frustrating having to share busy lifts and wait for a long time on my floor to get one.

However, I feel compelled to write about the staff of the hotel and how they float above. It is evident that the hotel's staff are true ""New Yorkers"". They are young aspiring designers, artists, and future hospitality royalty, and are fully embedded in the best the creative New York has to offer. The front desk and charming concierge (Jesse, I believe) were extremely helpful with my stay and affording me the highest rate of repose. In addition, and more importantly, they were able to curate my itinerary so I too was able to become fully embedded in the creative and ""authentic"" side of the city as if I were a local (if only for a couple days).

Simply put, the views are senational, the location superb, the roof top bar breath taking. You could not ask for more from a NY hotel atypical of the meatpacking district.That said, it is a hotel for a particular group of people. I would not recommend for people with young children, people wanting a quiet break or not interested in the NY night life.It has a popular rooftop bar/ nightclub with a specific door policy. Music from the bar can be heard in levels below (we were 3 levels below) although we were not troubled by it.It is super busy from midday till late because of this, as is the ground floor bar and restaurant area which provided a great vibe.The service is typical NYC. We were intially surprised by some of the aloofness of the staff but accept this was no different to anywhere else in NY after we had spent some time in the city. Sure some were better than others, (thanks to Jessie in the Concierge) and some were down right rude in that they just totally ignore you, but this can be expected anywhere and should not influence your decision to stay here.Despite having a larger room, they are quite small and basic. The bed was amazingly comfortable - you could almost just lie in it all day and stare at the Hudson if there wasn't so much to do. Yes it is pricer than others available, but certainly worth it for the views alone. Try exercising in the amazingly equipped gym with 180o city views! hard to concentrate on exercise.We definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again.Warning - be aware of the taxes you have to pay in NYC. We did not reserach this before hand and found after a week, it cost us an additional $500 on our accommdation bill which would have certainly influenced decisions we made on expenditure.","Singapore, Singapore",40,4.0

After booking flights, we decided to stay at The Standard. I'm not one for super trendy habitats, but my guy friend is, so we booked a Queen Superior room for four nights. I wanted a tub, and with this room you get a tub plus a shower. When you choose to stay at a place like the Standard (or the Gansevoort, or the Smyth, or whatever) you are staying there for the ""fabulousness"" aspect as well as for comfort and location. The room - a ""mod pod"" really - was very comfortable and very interesting in design. The views were incredible. The bed was very, very comfortable and the A/C and water pressure worked great. The tub is a deep, large square ceramic box, and not for lounging/soaking. Too bad!. It's not comfy to even sit in because the drain is smack in the middle of the tub and you will, invariably, pass over the tub plug with your boo-twah. The shower sufficed. The pillows are down but I bet they have others if you are allergic to feathers. Surprisingly, the amenities in the fridge and on the shelves were not crazy overpriced. Water was $4.00 or $6.00, for example. Amazing. The toilet is in it's own little private closet with a door. The mini ironing board and full sized iron came in handy. The black out curtains worked great. So the room was great and worth the $275 - $350 you will pay a night, plus taxes and various other little fees. And they have 24/7 room service, which was extremely nice. The Standard Grill had an excellent breakfast. Great coffee and yogurt/berries/granola. A wonderful selection of foods and beverages. Very white tile/French cafe-ish. I loved breakfast there. It was too hot to be outside when we were there so we never sat outside for cocktails or food. And this is a place where there are lots of people outside! Outside the lobby, outside the Grill, outside the Biergarten, outside on the Highline, etc etc. The Standard, in the Meatpacking district, is a huge space occupied at most times of any given day with oodles and oodles of people. You know the type....those fabulous people. Louboutin heels, Malandrino dresses, Penguin shirts, Varavatos slacks, ultra skinny jeans, etc. Trendy, trendy, trendy. If you want relative escape from swarms of trendy people, you will have this escape only in your room, in the lobby between 5 and 10 a.m and maybe while waiting for your elevator before 6 p.m. You will have it no where else. So if privacy at all times is your thing, be prepared for the gaggle of people hanging out here, most especially after 6 pm. Good thing....cabs are always there for you. The rooftop bar on 18 is closed to hotel guests, generally, after 8 or 10 pm. There is usually an event of some type going on that is closed to the general public. People are dying to get to the rooftop bar because it's verboten. They really glam it up and giggle their way to the 18th floor. These people - who will share your elevator ride on occasion - are cute, or extremely annoying, depending upon your personal perspective of people who frequent trendy rooftop bars. All I know is there was no noise pollution, even with the throngs of people, and I slept like a baby without requiring ear plugs. On the whole, the Standard is an excellent, convenient, aesthetically interesting hotel. The staff were kind and pleasant. ""Pleasant"" in a New York City kind of way, not in an Omaha kind of way. Don't expect lots of smiles and homestyle friendliness. Just quickly friendly and helpful.","Iowa City, Iowa",274,5.0

Warning: if you read the reviews, you'll see that a lot of people are disappointed by the Standard, either because they find the staff snobby or because the place is over-run with people looking to party. Neither of these things should come as a surprise to anyone, based on the location of the hotel and the bars connected to it and surrounding it.Here's my experience: I showed up super early and was able to check in around 12:00 p.m. Our room was on the 12th floor, toward the end of the hall and facing uptown. The room was a good size, had a HUGE window overlooking the Highline and the Empire State Building. Nice flat screen TV, queen bed, glassed in shower (my wife noted that if you are not traveling with a very close companion, this may be a little awkward) and separate toilet. There was also a surprising amount of storage.We have eaten in the restaurant and have had a drink in the beer garden, so we didn't do that this time, but we enjoyed both in the past. The bar on the top floor is pretty incredible. (The closest thing I can compare it to is the view from Mix at the top of Mandalay Bay in Vegas.) It's definitely over the top, but again, that's to be expected. Don't go looking for friendly and attentive service, it's just not that kind of place. But the views are incredible and just being in there makes you feel like a rockstar.We did venture up to the rooftop deck for a bit. Wow. Holy fratastic spring-fling. There were drunken people laying all over the place (oh, to be 23 again). Needless to say, we didn't hang around there much, but it's there if you want it. I found the front desk staff to be pretty professional. They definitely give off a vibe that they're not to be bothered, but once you see through that, they're pretty good about getting you checked in/out and telling you about the hotel. The bell staff was pretty good as well. The first guy took our luggage for storage, noted the time we needed a cab and was very helpful. The second basically loaded our luggage in the cab.In sum, if I had spent $400 or $500 I would probably have expected a little more. (We got a great deal, $250, through Jetsetter.) This is not a Ritz, Four Seasons or the like, and you shouldn't expect that kind of quality or level of service.

What is smashing is the view from the hotel. It just doesnt get any better. Rooms are relatively small, but super nice. Modern in a very cosy way. Whether MePa is your kind of place is a matter of taste. Personally I find it slightly silly at night, but wonderfully calm and creative at day. Now to the negative things: the service is rediculously bad. Hardly ever a smile or ""welcome"" from anyone, slow service, totally random whether someone helps you with luggage etc. Finally the Standard does nothing to make customers feel that they are main focus of the staff and the hotel as such. Most clearly illustrated by the lack of access to the wonderful rooftop bars. Hotelguest are kicked out at 22, because that is whene the hotel earns extra money by renting it out for private parties. Add to this the experience I had, where I had invited business contact for a drink at 19 - i.e. Before normal kick-out-time - but unfortunately that day everything had already been rented oyt to private parties. Anyone bothered to at least inform the hotel guests? Of course not.

There were of course a handful of helpful people working there but the pouts outweighed the smiles and when one of my friends asked to change rooms the reaction was down-right rude.

The Standard should be experienced at least once (for the elevators alone) but already the shine is fading away.It's luck of the draw with staff. On this visit we were checked in by a 20-something who's calling in life most likely wasn't hospitality. But to be fair, what he lacked in personalty he made up in attitude. Something tells me he had bigger plans.On the other end of the spectrum, there was a customer services director who's name escapes me, however she did her best to get us the best room possible (and even a bottle of wine and fresh fruit on arrival.) Above and beyond and very much appreciated. Part of me wanted to share the platter with old mate down at reception. I wanted to let him take a bite out of the big apple that had seemingly taken a bite out of him. Then I decided 11 floors was too far away to 'pay it forward.' The room is a highly stylised shoebox, but the view is incredible. Either side of the building is fine as you'll look into either Manhattan and the Empire State, or down the the financial district and over the Hudson into Jersey. The TV is big, the internet is free and the rooms are cool. But they're dating faster than the phrase 'bi-winning.' The boom boom room is a great place to have a thousands dollar drink with a million dollar view while watching people watch each other, guessing who's got the most cred in the room (it's a trick- they're all douches.) The recently opened gym up the top has such a ridiculous view you'll have no trouble finding the motivation to do a half-assed work out over twice the time. I'd say go once if you can afford to burn some cash. It's a great, once in a lifetime NYC experience. The views are the biggest draw card. It is somewhat poignant this hotel is slowly living up to it's name.","Chicago, Illinois",3,3.0

I've stayed in lots and reviewed quite a few on TripAdvisor now, so you can see I'm pretty balanced. When I travel for leisure, I really looking for one thing - good service. You'll note that from some of the previous reviews I've written, so hopefully you'll understand I'm not out to take a pop at this hotel. Here we go....It was a bad sign when the Limo pulled up and the driver had to ask US if we knew where the bell boys were. None to be seen in sight, not even a bell-stand to suggest where he should pull up. By the time our driver got our luggage out, and we had hauled it to reception I was already more than a little taken aback by The Standard of welcome at this '4 star' hotel. There was no-one waiting at the front door, as there would be in most hotels. No-one to offer you a seat or a refreshing drink while they take away your passport and get you checked in, as they do in almost all hotels, everywhere in the world in such heat and humidity, which was truly sweltering that day. We stood, patient (if sweaty) and tired at reception where we were processed (I wouldn't really call it a check-in) swiftly. We were told by the check-in agent that we could only use half of the hotel's bars until 10pm in the evenings, after which time we, the paying guests, were no longer welcome and would have to leave. This wasn't just on one night, it was all nights. I checked the website, that info is there, but it's not on display. It's definitely not on any of the blogs postings they put on Facebook, or the emails that they pepper your account with almost every day after you make your reservation.So, now we'd been processed, I stood looking blankly while I waited for an act of God. Er, I mean a bell boy. No, none to be found and no-one volunteered to find one so WE took our bags up to our room. Rooms are nice, but small. There's a nice seating area with a table, a great TV, our room had a bath and a rain shower. The finish was good, but there's a totally ridiculous amount of storage space. Two people with a suitcase and a bag each could unpack about two days of clothes maximum, each.Not deterred by our check-in experience, we were hungry and decided to head to the Grill for a late lunch. It was empty apart from two tables. We stood for I'd say around five minutes, waiting for FOUR members of staff, who were LESS than 1 metre from us, to ask if we would like a table (having tried several 'hellos' and 'harrumphs' while they busily ignored us. In the end, the Charcutrierre noticed we were looking rather irritated and suggested 'perhaps one of you could seat these guests?' to her colleagues.We were seated and offered menus by a pleasant young man. We ordered our lunch. We ordered a St. Emilion (as I recall) to accompany lunch which was pretty well priced at about $60 or so for the bottle. Lunch arrived very promptly and we sat and waited for our wine... 'It's coming right up, Sir', so we began to eat, much to the protest of my French partner, to whom eating before the wine has breathed for at least ten minutes is a sin. We waited for wine (a very perky one, which was not bad at all, but served too cold, which let it down) but unfortunately, the wine arrived as I took one of my last bites of steak. No apologies were offered or received, not even the OFFER of a free desert or coffee, which is the custom in any restaurant when the customer is left waiting, never mind left waiting for his wine. I had been in the hotel less than 2 hours and I already knew that if this was The Standard, I was not going to be a happy man for the next five days.In short, far too much chatter and banter among the staff, and nowhere near enough focus on the guests, their order, their needs, desires or expectations. You get better service in MacDonalds. And faster.Talking about MacDonalds... let's discuss those wonderful bars.Having been mightily irritated by the no-guests after 10pm policy, I am now able to say I don't think we actually missed much. We went up on the first evening to one of the bars at issue. Having waited 20 minutes in a bar I would estimate could hold 200, but at that time had an equal number of guests to bar men, one of them sidled up and served us. We enjoyed the view. We also admired the foaming yellow-y weirdness that was the 'jacuzzi'.The two bars on the ground floor (yes! these are the ones you, the paying guests, are 'allowed' to use), suffer from their success and the same profound absence of staffing as those upstairs. They're also open to the world and it's wife, so don't go hoping to get served (noticing what 'The Standard' really refers to, yet? Certainly, we were getting the message and it was only our first night).You see, it appears that in a parallel universe encompassing a small corner of Meat Packing, the longer you wait for anything - a drink, a menu, food, a bell boy, a glimmer of pleasantry - the more people will write rave reviews about it. We 'experienced' this level of service throughout our stay. This was 'The Standard' of Service.I also enjoyed had the good fortune of 'experiencing' the service levels of this hotel BEFORE as well as during my stay. The Concierge service, while eventually 'getting there' with a level of direction I think most people would reserve for a 6 year old, took over a dozen emails to book one excursion. Honestly, I really, really, really should have just done it myself. There was nothing convenient or helpful about it at all. I put more time into telling them what I wanted to do, than they did in satisfying my requests. Let's not even get onto the subject of them replying, but then that's The Standard I now know I should have expected!In summary, I don't think it will be long before people start to realise that in fact, this hotel is all about paying for style over substance and that you can have as nice or better a room at any other high-end hotel (probably bigger, though sadly I'll admit without the river view) for less money and without the obnoxious attitude and absence of service. One thing's for sure - it will be a darned sight easier to get fed and watered elsewhere, particularly if you want to do the two things at the same time.Redeeming features:- the view. Book a room with a bath on a high floor. Be careful with the windows, they are NOT one-way. - the high-line. Very nice in Summer.- lots of French people, so made for a good time laughing about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's misfortune, just a few blocks downtown of us.Downsides: -facilities. if you are a Nun and go to bed before 10pm at night, this would be the ideal convent for you. If you are not a Nun, repent for thou hast considered staying here and it is truly a sin. Do not get a Cosmopolitan or Mojito, do not go out partying on the roof deck, go directly to confessional instead.- room size. Yes, it's New York, but don't expect to join in any cat-swinging tournaments, Rumours of a lack of storage space are entirely accurate (on the upside, you don't need to unpack)- service. You are in America and have SO MUCH choice. This hotel knows it stands out on a design front and uses that to it's advantage.Simply put, I thought it was awful. The staff don't respect the guest and I left with the distinct feeling that I had paid nearly three thousand dollars ground rent so others could have a party on the top floor at my expense. There is nothing, zero, zip, not one single thing that would persuade me to ever eat, drink or stay there again and I urge you to avoid it, too. They simply do not deserve your money.","Houston, Texas",24,1.0

I cannot remember ever having worse service in a hotel ...at any price. It appears that the Standard has no standards when in comes to hiring it's service and managerial personnel. Staff is hired based on thier level of strangeness or eccentricities, whether it be odd forms of personal style, body art, piercings etc and nothing to do with how to greet and serve the public. for instance. At breakfast we waited 20 minutes for our heavily tattoed and pierced waitress to bother coming over and rather than saying hello and offering us coffee or anything , she complained that it was a busy morning and that sucks because she had a hangover... hellooo. Everyone seems aloof and can't be bothered... but not in an ""i'm too cool"" way, but in a completely clueless, i'm an idiot,way. On a positive note if you can get food... It is very good.

The hotel itself is located in the Meat Packing District, while I wouldn't recommend my parents come to this part of town as a young gay couple it was fine. Hip shops, nice restaurants and the High Line is all part of the appeal. The hotel entrance is a bit of a let down especially compared to the beautiful main building. The lobby is stylish but smelt of a burger grill. The bar/grill which is part of the hotel is off the entrance so if you aren't a fan of cooking meat- you may not enjoy! The check in was swift and friendly, we were dealt with by a super trendy hipster. The lifts are AMAZING, and I would tell most people to come to the hotel just to see these! The room was nice, it isn't very big but it was very clever in it's layout. Views were as expected; amazing. Our room had a glass wall between the bed and the bath tub so I wouldn't really recommend this hotel to anyone other than couples. The main issue we had was the noise. We are talking full on. The plumbing for the rooms obviously backs onto each other, and as such if next door was using the bathroom, then so were we. This was augmented by the fact the shower and bed are beside each other. We had to call the reception about it and were told ""to wait a few minutes"". While I understand that there isn't much they can do about the construction I was shocked that a hotel that had been open for so long with such obvious problems continued to market itself as high end.... There is also a club on the roof, which we went to. Fine on the night you are there, annoying when you are trying to get sleep. We were paying a huge amount of money to stay here yet our sleep quality was really messed up by this. As mentioned in another review, the halls were being painted. Not a big deal- but again paying $300ish per night for a hotel that smelt like burgers in the lobby and wet paint in the corridors? I can't really call this value for money.

First, I'll give The Standard a few kind words because they are doing some things properly:1. The beds are really, really comfortable, and so are the pillows. The sheets are also amazingly soft.2. When on my first night the people next door held a party in their tiny room from 1:45-4am, replete with music and shouting, the hotel did move me to a different room. 3. Christian, from Room Service, was positively the nicest person at the entire hotel. He made me feel like a guest, and that wasn't the reception I got from everyone else who worked here. A+, Christian, you rock.Ok, now for the cons. I get that The Standard is going for a minimalist look. However, I found the overall design of the room bordering on the austere and the functionality severely lacking. There was nothing about the rooms (and I stayed in two of them, due to item #2 above) that made me feel like I was staying at a hotel that was concerned with aesthetics/visual appeal/luxury. The bathrooms were poorly designed, no doors and water splashing and leaking everywhere. Not to mention their shiny black subway tile reminiscent of an unrenovated apartment from the 70s. Not chic, just industrial looking. The convenience beauty items like shampoo, conditioner, etc. were nice, especially the honey lotion, but the packaging looked like I'd just bought no-name bug spray at a convenience store.Probably more aggravating than anything else at The Standard is the utter disdain nearly everyone who works at the hotel has for you. It always felt like I was putting someone out by staying at the hotel--whether it was getting someone to hail a cab, help me carry my belongings during my room change, or simply passing an employee in the hallway, etc. Only exception was Christian from item #3 above, and the woman I saw doing housekeeping--the only 2 friendly people in the establishment.The other really aggravating part about staying here is the noise from the remaining meatpacking establishments nearby. They're just trying to run their businesses so this is not their fault, but why build a hotel here without taking this into account? As a result of this, at 3:45 AM for 3 nights, I listened to incessant beeping from the bobcat machine loading items in and out of trucks for delivery (and I was on the 12th floor). I would compare this to having a dull bedside alarm clocking that never stops going off, no matter how many times you hit the snooze button. In addition, West Side Highway traffic picks up at about 6am. The floor to ceiling windows in the rooms don't buffer against this too much, so if you're sensitive to noise, this is fair warning.Lastly, during my stay, without warning, they began painting the entire corridor white with absolutely no ventilation. My first room (on the 10th floor) smelled of fresh paint. Not cool. I was then moved to the 12th floor, which was much quieter.The Standard has some pros, but a lot of cons--some of which can be fixed in terms of enhancing customer service (if they even want to), and others that are just inherent to the hotel. I won't be returning to The Standard.",Boston,2,2.0

High-end shopping, bars and clubs galore, various dining options, easy access to the High Line. Not super convenient to the subway, but if you're staying here you're probably a cab person anyways.The rooms: Modern and stylish, with great views. Small, but good use of space and attractive furnishings. The shower must be mentioned: great rain shower-head, only separated from the room by a glass wall. There were little things where they decided style was more important than function -- the lack of a shower door means water tends to splash on the bathroom floor, the stylish sink splashes a bit, and the toilets don't flush with enough water volume. But frankly, if you chose to stay here, these things probably matter less to you than the quality design and happening vibe of the hotel anyways.Room service food was also quite good (though there are so many good restaurants in the area you shouldn't use it often). The Standard Grill is decent and usually quite happening (especially the beer garden when the weather is nice).

They all seemed too concerned with appearing cool to be able to offer decent service. In addition, the concierge didn't seem to know the basic ropes of NY tourism, since she (when told we would like to see Ellis Island) told us it would be a 20 minute walk from the hotel to Battery Park (!) and failed to inform us that we could have booked ferry tickets online and have skipped the long lines.

The problems started when at 5:30am on the morning of our first night we were awoken by the neighbors, lets just say they sounded pleased to see each other.. the second night was worse... from about 9:00pm all we could hear was the neighbors music playing and the noise from the rest of the hotel was adding to this uncalled for madness.... After complaining to reception about the amount of noise.. they sent someone up to check the noise level... but obviously the whole hotel was loud so they claimed not to able to hear anything. I asked to move rooms, however after checking 5 other rooms, yes 5! We could not find a single quiet room in the hotel, and after a long transatlantic flight we were annoyed... we said that we wanted to check out... They got the manager who said that on this occasion he had done all he could and we could cancel our reservation but that we will probably be charge another nights stay because it was up to 'accounting' to decide! So at 12:45am we checked out. The following day I called accounting to check if we would be charged for a room that we didn't stay in because the hotel was too noisy. They said that we would have to wait for a few days! This is not good customer service. The hotel has a club on the top floor and the reception area at night is very loud, the staff not being very approachable or polite.

I was drawn in by it's beautiful design and giant windows. For celebration of my anniversary I booked a room on the 15th floor with an amazing view of the Hudson and downtown. The room was small but modern and clean. The giant tub was great for a relaxing bath, however the relaxation didn't last long. After checking in, my boyfriend and I decided to grab some lunch downstairs in the grill. After encountering 3 very rude hostesses incapable of even looking up to greet us we were finally seated. After a very drawn out lunch due to the slow service we rushed upstairs to our room for sunset. We decided to go upstairs to the notorious 18th floor bar for a glass of champagne and to checkmout the view before heading out to dinner. Once upstairs we were informed the bar was closing at 730 for a private party. I was rather upset. When I spoke to the front desk I asked why we weren't told at check-in. They had no response. Once the desk realized I was upset I was told ""I will see what I can do"" by the front desk staff. We waited around the hotel for another 30 min. I never received a call. By this time my stomach began turning over itself. We left for our dinner reservation. I sat through the entire dinner uncomfortable and in pain. After dinner we promptly returned to the hotel. I spent the rest of the night in the bathroom or curled up on the floor in agonizing pain.The music from the 18th floor was bumping until 330am.

I was surprised to find my room a serene oasis, and the hotel busy yet calm. The staff could not have been nicer--every single employee I encountered, from the front desk to the gift shop. Whatever I asked for, I got (and quickly) with no attitude. Everyone made me feel welcome there. They were all wonderful. Every employee was friendly and helpful and responsive. Every aspect of the stay was heavenly, and in fact I kept extending my stay until one night when the hotel was completely sold out. (It was probably good for my bank account that I finally had to leave!) In terms of the room itself, the design is spare but has anything you could possibly need. It was absolutely beautiful, with sweeping views of the city and the Hudson River.

The staff while nice enough didn't make me feel welcome either and the ridiculous routine of getting up to the rooftop bar with names being ticked off a list and being asked to leave b4 9pm etc just made me not want to be there. The whole place is based on exclusion, constantly being judged on whether you are good enough to get in etc. It just didn't make me feel very relaxed and I didn't enjoy my stay.Oh and I hated the bath products!

Rooms are big enough, big windows (try to get a room as high as possible), bed comfortable and cosy.

But on Christmas eve after getting ready to up there we found it was in fact closed for the 24th and 25th, which was a great disappointment. So if you are staying over the holidays be sure to ask when it is open.  Apart from that one detail, we had a wonderful stay. The suggestions from the concierge were nothing short of inspired. There is a good variety of equipment in the gym, and you can not beat the 17th floor view while you work out. The food in the Grill was excellent as were the cocktails and buzz in the 18th floor bar, when we did get to go. The area is surrounded by good (and expensive) shops and lovely bars and restaurants.  Last of all, we were stuck for an extra two days due to the adverse weather, and the staff were amazingly helpful and accommodating. We were able to stay on in our same room, and the bookings department were very sympathetic to our situation as we did not know how much longer we would need to stay at first. It felt more like a bonus two days of holiday than an ordeal.  If you are looking for a treat, The Standard is the place to stay.",London,6,5.0

Plus, the building's architecture and lobby design are pretty fabulous. The room itself was cosy and very well designed. By cosy, I mean both comfy and very small. It's a little like a high end ship's cabin, except with one entire wall being a giant window onto Lower Manhattan, the Hudson, Jersey City and the Statue of Liberty. I watched the sun rise and set. The queen-sized bed was extremely comfortable, there was a small table and sofa, enough closet space, a deep soaking tub, and interesting toiletries.One thing that some people might have a problem with is that the bed is in a corner.We stayed 3 nights, thought housekeeping was good, the bar okay (only tried restaurant bar), the beer garden fun, and the reception staff un-attentive.",Philadelphia,51,4.0

We stayed in a Hudson River view room, which had the most stunning views possible, amazing sunsets/rises too. The room was very comfy, not huge but had everything you could need. The showeroom was cool with a glass separation so you can be watched or watch the TV as you shower.The restaurant attached makes the nicest breakfasts, definately a must when you stay! We did attempt to go there for dinner but reservations are a must unless you don't mind an hour and a half wait... Room service was delicious- the burgers are YUM.The local area is super cool, with lots of trendy/designer shops and very local to get into Soho which is probably my favourite neighbourhood.

Rule #1 that any doorman who knows his stuff - Treat everyone the same as you would the most imprtant guest at the hotel.Check-in is a little messy with 2 staff sitting behind laptops flanked by counters on either side but not making any eye-contact with anyone. The staff I got a reception was very helpful when he found out ti was my first stay in NYC and proceeded to offer me options for my room with different views available (additional cost as well but thi swas NOT a hard sell but allowed me to choose).I opted for the standard room. While looking for the elevators, again 2 staff (they looked like the may have been part of the concierge team) at the reception counter who were in chatting away totally ignored me till I asked them for directions to which one looked at me and told me where it was without as much as a hand gesture to point or changing body language. The rooms are functional and quirky and the rounded design gives one the feeling of being in a ship or aeroplane cabin which I enjoyed. The floor to ceiling windows gives the smallish room a sense of space and a lot of natural light. Warning.. the bathtubs only have a glass screen separating it from the bedroom and no privacy screen. So you either have a shower in full view of anyone else in the room or get them to go have a drink downstairs. I have been in hotels with similar designs but they usually come with a pull down privacy screen. Somethings you just don't want others to see. Thankfully the bathroom has a door. Another thing is that the shower/ bathtubs are about 3/4 of metre off the ground which makes it hard to get in or out if you have any sort of injury or disability. Not sure if other rooms cater for this.Probably best toiletries I have ever gotten for a standard room in a hotel (have stayed in close to 200 hotels in my life) and the bottles are so large that I took then with me as I didn't want to waste any.Rooms also come with free internet for the 1st day then paid for the rest.The Grill is superb and the service again inconsistent. The waitress and busboys were fantastic yet some of the reception staff were bad. As I walked in, again I was ignored till I piped out (must be my ugly head...lol). The food here is value for money and wine list though limited, adapts well with the food. The buzz within the restaurant was good if you're into that sort of thinkg.The meat packing district is an exciting one and definitely has yet to even reach it's full potential. There is lots to do around the area and High Line is a feature of course - though a little brown and bear in the winter but a great concept nevertheless. A sense of gritty New York mixed with the trendy artistic makes this area unique. Don't forget to visit the great Chelsea Markets for some great fresh produce.The one major gripe that I had was that I cancelled a tour to make the rooftop bar in time only to be told that it was booked for the evening. Spoke to the Duty Manager about how inconvenient this was for someone in NYC on such a short trip - this being a feature of the hotel, staff should advise guest when they check-in to avoid disappointment and inconveniencen as there is enough to do in NYC otherwise (there was another couple trying to get to the rooftop bar and were equally disapointed when I told them it was not open.)Plus - Trendy, great views, things to do around the areaNegative - Staff need to realise they aren't working in a trendy nightclub but a hotel (not that any service orientated person should provide anything less than the best service irrespective of where they work)To the Standard Hotel - Your staff seem to lack the passion of having the experience of working in a hotel that bucks the trend yet allows guest to still experience first class service. Snooty does not translate to class or exclusivity.","Sydney, Australia",19,3.0

We stayed in a superior queen and i would certainly recommend this catergory of room or above. We had clear views of the statue of liberty, hudson river and the financial district. The amenities in the bathroom smell great and are superior to anywhere i've stayed before. The beds are super comfy and the robes for use in the room are fantastic. We ate at the Standard Grill on our second night and were not dissapointed, great atmosphere, super friendly service, you MUST make a reservation to avoid dissapointment. The living room (lobby bar) is a nice place to unwind after a tough day slogging the manhattan tourist trail and have a great chocolate mousse, drinks are NYC prices. I would say that the morning staff here are far more attentive than the evening staff. We found the staff in the evening were more concerned with hanging out with each other than making the hotel money by getting you a drink, but this is really knit picking. You absolutly must book a table for the Sky lounge (may be called something else) on the 17th floor for a sunset martini.

In my defence there were a lot of people milling around going to various functions. When I made my way into the reception area it was fairly deserted so didn't have any problems checking in.The design of the public areas is achingly trendy but finding one's way through dark narrow corridors to the elevators isn't a good way to start! For some reason each evening the direct way to the elevator lobby, plus two of the four elevators were shut off.The room was tiny - but the view magnificent - floor to ceiling windows looking out over the Hudson - surely the whole point of the place - which made the notice asking you to close the curtains so as not to embarass the neighbours rather a joke!Odd layout - the lavatory was closed (fortunately - the seat wasn't fixed properly and made much noise when anyone stood up) but the bathroom open to the rest of the room. A huge bath seemed totally pointless - it took up space that could usefully been used for other things and filling takes ages - every time anyone in adjacent rooms filled theirs we were treated to thunderous plumbing noises for 15 minutes. I find it extraordinary in these times that anyone would install such water-wasting facilities in a new hotel. The worst thing about the bathroom, as others have noted, is that the drainage for the shower goes in totally the wrong direction - out towards the room and the fitted carpet. With each shower all the towels were needed to prevent flooding. I can't imagine that the bathroom furniture is removed every day to clean the residue of soapy water....And no rubbish bin in a bathroom? Nice toiletries but useless hairdryer.Another irritation - the minibar was ridiculously overstocked with unheard-of alcohols in what looked like perfume bottles (elderflower liqueur, ginger liqueur...) but no fruit juices and, for the first time ever in a US hotel - and I've stayed in hundreds! - no coffee-making facilities!The room was OK for a single person but even a close couple would struggle - the queen-sized bed is pushed up in a corner against the wall and the space between the bottom of the bed and the window filled with the television. Nice design features but poor qualtiy finishes - the table top was very scratched.Generally the sound-insulation was poor - apain addition to the plumbing, closing doors and people in the corrdiors were more than audible!We found the staff friendly and the location was fine but overall I thought the hotel was pretentious and disappointing and $500+ is way too much to pay for a view.",Switzerland,51,5.0

The service was good, although I must add that I was rather put of when we on friday night was stopped in the door when we tried to get up to the bar on the 18th floor. Apparently the bar is privately run after 10.00 on weekend nigths and it's not enough to stay at the hotel, you have to be on the list. The bar was absolutely marvelous though, but watch our the the bloody mary as the bartender didn't seem to know that it's not enough with spice, you have to add tomato juice as well.....we had to ask for extra juice three times. The area was great, with cool bars and restaurant in every corner and nice strech for walks (along the pier and on the high line). We didn't try the grill for dinner although I'm sure it's excellent.

The equipment is average with minimal weight resistance machines for different parts of the body so don't expect too much here. There is enough in the fitness center to get a decent workout however. Getting access to the bar at the top of the hotel was difficult due to private functions and cryptic communication of how to access the club and bar after 8:30pm.

The gym was the best I have used in any hotel and equipment was state of the art and very clean. The location was great for our needs as we wanted to be close to the village and also get some walking in, we walked to times square for breakfast most days and started our adventures from there, the chelsea markets are a street away and had the only decent coffee we could find so was great. The bathroom concept is hilarious and I wouldnt recommend staying if you were shy about showering or getting ready in full view of your partner however no stress for us.one down side and <i did see this mentioned in several reviews before we stayed was feeling very much second rate to the night club, quite often we got id^d coming into the hotel (great feeling at $600 a night to get asked time and time again for id by the same bouncer) so felt a massive disconnect from the staff and very much second class citizens. Not too worried about it but is important to note, as having travelled extensively all over the globe this is the worst yet.The roof top bar is amazing but on the beautiful day we went up there there were no seats available and it was full of non hotel guests again, a bit dissapointing but NY is crammed with amazing venues so no real stress to find somewere elese to spend our holiday dollars.

The Sales team, and especially Austin, have been amazing in accommodating our needs, and have gone out of their way to give us amazing rates for the good causes, as well as bending around last minute changes when possible. Rooms are great for NYC - not massive, but very effectively and beautifully designed to give the impression of having enough multi-purpose space (and lots of natural light!) in a compact room. Brilliant for solo or couple travelling, but too lacking in privacy for colleagues or less than best friends sharing.Staff were unanimously friendly, and were very natural and chatty...not the usual, overly formal attitude of some luxury hotels. The ONLY slight downside experienced was the unfriendly welcome of the lady on the front desk at the 18th floor bar. To be fair, she is probably used to dealing with a steady stream of pretentious people during the club hours, so wasn't ready with a smile, more a sneer. However, she warmed up a bit when I was just plain friendly, and the rest of the experience was a delight.I am returning for another stay in 2 weeks time!","Los Angeles, California",0,4.0

Take the valet parking($55?). Well worth it. You don't need your car once you are there as you can walk or take the train anywhere.The hotel was new, very clean and staff was attentive and friendly. Room has floor-to-ceiling windows and there are warnings not to leave your drapes open at night as it becomes a fishbowl! We were in Room 1203, which had a nice view of the Hudson on our left and straight ahead, the Empire State Building. We stayed in a king room. The shower has a glass window panel that separates it from the bed, so beware that you are showering in front of anyone who is sleeping in the bed next to you! Separate toilet with closing door. i didn't see any other rooms so don't know if they are all like that. Fully stocked refrigerator and shelves with snack items as well(although we did not take anything as they are pricey). Elevator has an interesting video collage of Heaven and Hell in these built-in niches on 2 walls. As you ascend, it becomes Heaven, as you descend, it becomes Hell. Different. I'm not sure if I liked that. Just my personal opinion.We ate downstairs in the Standard Grill Restaurant(make reservations) and the food was amazing! Try their famous Penny Drop drink-Yum!

I've stayed at a number of other NY Hotels for business travel and this by far the best one. Here are some of the reasons I love The Standard:*The rooms: For NY these rooms are very spacious. Each room has a ""window wall"" which is amazing. I could sit in my room all day and stare out the window. I've stayed on both sides of the hotel, but prefer the side with the city view, so I always ask for that side. *Design: The rooms are very modern but still feel very comfortable. The beds are comfortable and most rooms have a nice little seating are where you can get work done or enjoy the view. The place just feels stylish.*Service: The staff is INCREDIBLY helpful and friendly. I've heard they hire aspiring models- which makes most everyone nice to look at BUT there is no attitude at all! I was a pumping mom and had some special issues around refrigeration - and they were so accommodating!! *Location: The Meatpacking district just comes to life over the summer. I am always surprised by the level of activity in this neighborhood when the weather warms up. I love that you have acces to the High Line park if you want a nice after dinner stroll.The only hesitation I have about posting this review is that I don't want this hotel to become so popular that I can't get a room for my next business trip to NY.

I have traveled a lot in my life and stayed in many 5 * hotels and one thing is for sure politeness and respect to the customer IS NOT AN OPTION, IT IS A MUST!!! Surely something the Standand stuff needs to learn, from the bell boys to the manager! Rooms are small, the shower is black-tiled, very poorly lighten and has no doors which becomes a death-trap lake after a few minute shower. I had to take showers wearing my flip-flops in the fear of slipping. So privacy is out of the question especially when you travel with a friend like I was. Internet is slow and you have to connect to it every day, so if you go there for business like i I was, it will make your life hard.The receptionists seem rather bothered to serve you and only if you stand there for a few good minutes and wait for them to raise their heads from the laptops. I guess they are too cool to smile and be appreciative to a customer and too busy keeping the pretentiouness going. The cherry on the top was Noa the receptionist who checked us out. He looked so annoyed by our presence while we were paying for our stay and he was so uptight pretentious and snobish we left the hotel fuming!We choose 5* hotels for their class and the way they make the guest feel with their service, I guess the Standard is aiming to the exact opposite direction. The idiotic excuses that the premises are open to the PAYING guests for certain hours and then their admition to the roof bar is left at the discretion of the doorman are unheard of and unacceptable.And one more thing, before writing this, I read other guests' reviews and I also read the copy-pasted responce from Ian the manager. So please Ian don't bother giving me the same one, you were 'kind' enough to show me in person, that the stuff's attitute is directed by their manager, when I tried to express my discomford while there.

The rooms seem large on first look (and with that view and that light!), but then reality sets in. There is almost no space to hang anything and no space for a suitcase; the miniscule rooms at Hudson are more functional. The room decor is reminiscent of a 1970s rec room.

The basic hotel room was small, and the shower had no door. The closet was also small. As opposed to a few other reviews, I found the staff to be friendly enough. The floor below the top floor lounge was noisy. The bass of the speakers reverberated through the ceiling. This wouldnt have been so bad, but they dont even let you in to the bar! (They say guests are allowed in before 9 pm, but who the hell wants to go to a bar in the Meatpacking District before 9 pm?? What a joke.) Another thing that's odd: the hotel straddles the High Line, but it has no access to the High Line. You have to walk south a few blocks to get to it. Odd.There's nothing wrong with the hotel itself, really. But at the Ganesvoort they let you up to their popular bar and pool if you stay at the hotel.

My favourite was the Peek a Boo shower which we both giggled about when we first walked into the room. Secondly, having a separate toilet is a plus!Having never been to NY before the hotel seems to be in a great location with the Chelsea Markets and close proximity to both downtown and uptown.My only negative comments are about the roof top bar and the attitude of some of the staff. Having worked in hotels for a few years the front office department were a bit hit and miss with service. For a 5 star hotel you would generally expect more from the porters department and concierge as at times it seemed like we were inconveniencing them to ask a question. Their inability to smile consistently or to seem generally interested is something they need to work on. I must point out that Megan at reception was more than helpful in organising a room amenity before arrival however I thanked her in person upon arrival.Is it worth the price?

It is a very hip area with great shopping. The Standard is set in a fantastic area with unparalleled views of the Hudson as well as the Empire State building and the very cool High Line park. We are recently married and were upgraded to a suite which was lovely! I adored going to sleep with a view of the Empire State building each night. We could also see some of the Hudson and the Highline, so overall it was the very best view! Did I mention the bed? I need to find out where they buy their mattresses... I slept in every morning. I unfortunately didn't find the time to check out the biergarten which looked very cool, but we did manage to dine for a late lunch at the outdoor cafe which was very pleasant. The decor is spot on, the food was good and the server was knowledgeable and attentive. I was a big hungover and wanted a bloody mary as well as oysters and I was in luck - great bloody and fresh raw oysters! My husband and I also went to the outdoor rooftop bar (Le Bain) which is honestly a once in a lifetime experience. It was a gorgeous afternoon and it was enjoyable to take in the panoramic view of the Hudson from up there. And the waterbeds are a cool feature. We also had a cocktail in the 18th floor lounge (previously called the Boom Boom room) where we were able to take in some live music. The lounge closes early, but it was nice for a pre-party cocktail. Another thing I loved about this hotel is the close proximity to the Chelsea Market. It has a wonderful variety of restaurants, specialty shopping, bakeries & cafes etc. And the BEST coffee shop (Ninth Street Cafe). I walked there every morning for breakfast and a latte. I also like the walk to Greenwich village and enjoyed the now built-up meatpacking district. Overall we had a wonderful mini-honeymoon, enjoyed our room with amazing views and the superb location. Thanks for a great stay. The only negative I could think of is the lighting in the bathroom. The bathroom in our suite was all black and I had to put my makeup on in the other room (which was not a problem since there were a lot of mirrors and plenty of light in there).","Chicago, Illinois",37,5.0

The view was nice and the location was great but I do not feel like we got bang for the buck, at check out we told the clerk about our TV not working, dirty carpet and the very dirty louvers that are between the bathroom and room and simply got a ""sorry about that"" remark. Lets see for nearly $400 a night I would expect a TV that works and a SUPER CLEAN room. We came back to the hotel around 8:30PM and were going to get a drink at the rooftop before going to the room but instead I was told I could not go up in shorts so we went up to the room took a quick shower changed into pants and a nice shirt and went back down a little after 9 to only be told sorry it was now closed and was now a private club.

We were attracted to the location (in the Meatpacking District, over the Highline), the views, the sexy atmosphere and the architecture. Our room was a superior queen, about 230 square feet, but although space was used wisely, it felt a bit cramped. We only stayed for 2 nights, so we had enough room in the closet, but we used all of the table space for our luggage. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom, although small, was adequate. The rain shower and large tubs were nice amenities. We liked the 2 black bathrobes but never used them. The large TV set at the foot of the bed gave us an error code and didn’t work but we never bothered to get it fixed. There was a letter from Ian, who has answered several disparaging reviews on this forum. He reminded us that the windows were transparent and we should therefore use discretion. I am still confused as to whether the hotel wants us to perpetuate or dispel the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic reputation. I am guessing that there is a fine line somewhere and the hotel is straddling it without direction.We had a reservation for the Boom Boom Room and with anticipation we took the elevator up. The elevator had a video that seemed entertaining at first, but after a few trips to our room and upstairs, the video got tiresome and made the ride seem even longer. And now we must tell our velvet rope story. We went up to the Boom Boom Room and had 2 drinks each and shared a pate appetizer. The tab came to $110 before tax and tip. We would have spent more but the staff insisted that we leave before 10 PM so that the Boom Boom Room, hot tub bar and rooftop bar could open as an invite-only club. We asked if we could gain an invite but were told that we would not be offered one. Now this must be a very good marketing ploy because the best way to get someone to want something is to tell them that they couldn’t have it. We went to a late night show at the Duane Park Café and then returned to see if we could get past the velvet rope. Despite us being hotel guests and dressed to the nines (girlfriend had a gold sequined form-fitting Barbie Doll dress) we were not treated as invitees and were not given the privilege of waiting on a line for about an hour to pay $20-$25 for drinks. So next night, we didn’t try. After a Broadway show we ended up at Dizzy’s Coca Cola in the Time-Warner Building. There the cover was $5. We were able to walk right in and the jazz music was amazing. And the really good drinks were very reasonable. The setting was absolutely beautiful (makes the Boom Boom Room look like a corner deli) and the acoustics were perfect. I can't understand why people would prefer something like the Boom Boom Room. So the Standard did us a favor by not inviting us upstairs after 10 PM. And we won’t return. Ian, I don’t want to hear from you what the limited schedule is for facility use by hotel guests. And I don’t want to hear how you hope we will return and give you a chance to show us that our initial impressions were not really true. Your set up made us feel like second-class guests. Next time we will look for a place next time that makes us feel like we booked a first class ticket. If you want my partner and I to return, then ask Andre to contact us on this forum to discuss what it would take to make us come back. Allowing us to wait on line for an hour to get upstairs on an off night will not cut it.","Fairfield, Connecticut",29,3.0

I had the pleasure of visiting Boom Boom with friends who are regulars in December, and it was indeed quite a fashionable, exclusive crowd, so I get why it would not be feasible to allow all hotel guests inside. (For one, they simply would not fit as it's such a gorgeous space with brilliant views, all hotel guests would want to spend their evenings there!)That said, however, the Standard is now testing its guests patience too bloody far.

Then I got many diappointments as well.Me and husband was staying there for one at their Hudson Suit at $900 / night. Our purpose is business+leisure. Both of us being traveling for 2 weeks and NYC is our last stop. So we have a bit of bags with us. Below is our summary:Location: great location for leisure but not if you are coming for business in financeHotel & room: new and chic, great view. Size is too small even we are in the suit. We have to leave both our bags on the floor and we have to walk very carefully in the room. we won't fall on the floor. The shower place need to have door coz all the water being leaking out and it's all wet, bad design. I guess you need to sand your tile floor a bit coz their edges are pointy and sharp. The finishing of the carpet on the corridor is not firm and you slide them while you walk from lift to your room. Paints are not quite finished when you look at the ceiling and some corner .WiFi: it is free but you need to connect everyday. They drop off very fequently now and then. Once you walk out of the room, you lost it even you are still in the hotel. If you have a problem, they will connect you to an outsourced IT company. So if you are business traveller, it's a""no""Services: it varies, I met a few nice staffs especially the room service one called Andrew who is always sweet and happy to take my breakfast order. He will greet me everytime. However most are bad , it is an attitude issue and they forget basic like ""greeting your guest""!!! It's like we are too cool for you. It is ok if you want to brand it as a ""cool"" hotel but don't forget we are not paying to put up for a face. The staffs has to been tentative and have the initiative to assist your guest. Bars & restuarants: beer garden, forget about that , you need to go into the line with the non- hotel people , . They are every busy night after 6 pm. The Grill, sorry they are full all the time and no reservation can be made. My husband cannot been seated because I have not arrived!!!! The Living room, sorry they are full at night and we have to wait for 20 minutes. 18/ f , sorry they don't open to us after 8:30 because they are for private party. The bouncers are like killing you while you walk around them towards your lift . One Friday night at 11 pm . We couldnt get food or drink at all around the area, so we went back and hope to get food and drink in our hotel. Sorry all are full and we end up having room service. I wonder whether my hotel payment was contributing to these hardware as well? Are we the guests are suppose to have these benefit or priority.? Think about it again.

The rooms are amazing and EVERYTHING was new when I stayed.However what sucked were: 1. The service - The staff were arrogant and obnoxious little weasels! Never judge a book by it's cover, I was on a work/leisure trip however I had just flown from Australia to NYC. Now that's a 22-24 hours trip with an approx 15-16 hour straight flight. So by the time, I had to do the L.A to NYC leg, I was delirious, tired and needed a shower. Now, I was dressed comfortably and casually. Already I was getting looks from the staff.They didn't open my taxi door (which I don't mind) however why were they doing it for everyone else?I turned up at the reception to check in and was left standing there for seriously a few minutes while the girls and guys were talking about their plans for the weekend and other useless crap!Finally the receptionist asks, 'Do you understand the current rates we charge for this hotel?' By this stage, I was fuming. But I kept my mouth shut.Everything changed once she realised which room that was booked and what type of credit card I had and where I worked. This type of crap pisses me off! Management cannot change this behaviour, however the one thing I believe in is hire staff for attitude especially the face of the business because you can teach any monkey skills. The staff at The Standard need to shape up as the benefits of being the 'cool' and 'new' place to be will only be appealing for so long. 2. Their internet is terrible. I had to send through documents from a local internet cafe due to their slow service.3. The location is okay, unless you enjoy hanging around over-weight Russian gangsters with beautiful blonde young girlfriends, then this is the place to be.Overall, the experience was okay.

We were with a group of friends (some who live in the city) to celebrate some big birthdays. Hotel is a short cab ride away from Penn Station (we took the train from Boston) We stayed on the 6th floor in a regular room. Yes, the rooms are small but most are in NYC. The bed was king-sized and super comfortable and I loved the pillows. There was a good-sized flat screen TV across from our bed with a ton of channels. The mini-bar was quite extensive with anything you could possibly imagine. You have to be comfortable with who you are staying with if you have a room with the see-through shower. We loved it and thought the water pressure was great. Our room looked over the highline walkway and you can literally look down at people, many waved to us. Be aware of this as it is very easy to see into your room from there and at night, if you want privacy, draw the curtains (which by the way did a great job of blocking out the early morning light) We had friends who stayed on the 12th floor looking over the Hudson. Their room offered more privacy and they had a more private shower with bath. The rooms were relatively quiet. You could not hear any noise from outside, just the occasional door in the hallway. It had a good amount of towels, toiletries (even though I wasn’t a fan of what they provided) and great black robes that my DH loved! My only complaint with the room itself was storage space. Besides the tiny closet, there are no places to put your clothes. I couldn’t imagine what to do if you were there for an extended time. We just kept most of our stuff in our suitcase on the floor. The elevators were awesome with the video constantly playing, sometimes we wanted to keep riding in it just to watch. We went up to the Boom-Boom room late afternoon for cocktails , very stylish with great views! This is closed most weekend nights for private parties. You have to check out the bathrooms, floor to floor glass windows (like the whole hotel) looking out at the city. One of our friends was too uncomfortable to go the bathroom! We also had drinks and snacks in the lobby bar which also had a great outdoor seating area. We were lucky to have a very warm May weekend. Great people watching- we saw a commercial being filmed one day and models another for a magazine spread. Drinks and food are not cheap but we find that nothing is in New York so we were not surprised. We went to the BeerGardern late afternoon with friends which is a great place on a warm day (and they do serve more than beer) and also checkout the Standard Grill late night which had tasty sandwiches (at slightly reasonable prices). This whole area was hopping on Saturday night with a wide range of people. Located in the popular meatpacking district there is a lot to do in this area. We enjoyed walking the Highline which is not completed yet, but definitely a nice walk. Hogs and Heifers is across the street if you like beer and dive bars. Pastis is around the corner for brunch which we did (very busy place) and we also were able to go to Morimoto which is just a few blocks away for some great sushi. Overall, we really enjoyed our time at The Standard and would go back on our next trip to NYC","Boston, Massachusetts",564,4.0

We arrived a little early but were able to check in and they even upgraded us (without our even asking). The room was amazing - views of the Hudson River and down to the Statue of Liberty. The room had a wrap-around banquette across from the bed which was a nice touch. The TV was mounted to the floor right in front of the windows which was odd since it blocked part of the view. The bath was split on either side of the room as you walked in, with the shower/bath tub on one side (with a great louvered window to see the view) and the sink and toilet on the other side. I understand set up design-wise but it wasn't all that practical since the sink area was very small and the shower area had no door so water ran onto the carpet. We went to the lounge at the top of the hotel for a drink and snacks before the theatre (love the elevator art installation). It was retro-fun with a wonderful view (take your sunglasses). It was nice but a little chaotic - it felt like they didn't have the seating plan down yet. It is set up like a lounge so the tables were jumbled and and the wait staff kept pushing us to one side or the other trying to decide what table we were sitting at. Service was anything but invisible which was distracting. The menu was limited but nice. We had never stayed in the Meatpacking district before so weren't sure what to expect. We were really interested in seeing the HIgh Line and this was a great way to experience it. The park is beautiful - they did a phenomenal job on the design and details.

Very well-trained staff - attentive, very generous (FREE DRINKS! See below), always a step ahead of you, without being fussy (I despise sycophantic service elsewhere--uncomfortable!). Great location, too.I couldn't formally check-in as the reservation was under my partner's name -- he was on a later flight, due in about 4 hours. But the lady at the concierge made me feel at home immediately, arranging for the porter to stow my suitcases and loaning me a plug adaptor so I could use my laptop. She also moved me to the adjacent lounge/café, introduced me to the bubbly young hostess there, who she instructed to make sure my drinks were ""on the house"". I was blown away by their foresight in this matter; I certainly wouldn't be using their wifi to grumble about the wait on TripAdvisor. I had two of their house cocktails -- a mojito and a kir-like drink. Wanting to reciprocate on their generosity and try the menu -- I'd heard great things about The Standard Grill -- I had their amazing Club Sandwich, which was perfection, arriving with a fresh salad and mini condiment jars. The standard double room was small, as others have griped, but the fabulous modern furniture, mod/minimal design, and floor-to-ceiling windows made it feel airy. Those who gripe about room size need to consider the service -- this a great reminder that you pay for the experience, not just square footage (in NYC, at that).One more note: Breakfast. While not included, the restaurant has a great breakfast menu at very reasonable NYC prices and a great atmosphere; I would much prefer my $10 brioche-french-toast with caramelized bananas, walnuts and maple syrup over a generic spread any time!

To accentuate that point, when we checked in Friday night, it sounded like we were in the middle of the dance floor. However, when we got to our room, we had the quiet that we wanted. The room looked liked it hopped off the pages of an interior decorating magazine. Coolest part had to be the see-thru shower in the middle of the room (not for the shy).

We had a Kingsize room which had a fabulous view of the Empire State Building and the bath was big enough for 2 without touching!!! The location of the Standard is super, within easy walking distance of SoHo, Chelsea and the Meat Packing (or MePa if your hip!!) area has so many really good, reasonable places to eat and drink. I spent a few hours one afternoon just sitting in the sun watching the crowds at Bagatelle (night club in the day!!!) and felt entirely safe, happy and relaxed. So many people just sat chatting to me passing the time of day, it was such a good vibe. We had drinks in the 18th floor bar which has awesome views and although expensive is a must. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel for all travellers as the rooms are expertly designed to give maximum comfort in small spaces. Well worth paying a bit extra to have so many great places on your doorstep.",cambridge,29,5.0

We live in Brooklyn and just decided to check the place out and do something special. I also work near it, so I'm very familiar with it.The Stanard is very hip. And sexy. Probably the hippest hotel in NYC right now. We live here and did not even feel hip enough to be there. It is very too cool for school, but that's just how it goes. The staff is still nice and everything. Being at the Standard is a sight in itself and I think one of the best places to stay in NYC for a total experience at a good price. The lobby is cool, the elevators are cool, the location (it's literally right above the highline park) ok you get the point. The two restaurants in the hotel are great, etc. etc. Rooms are on the small ""pod-like"" side but they make up for size in style and view. I definitely recommend this place. Much better than staying in a generic hotel. It feels like you're staying in your own private apt. in NYC. Plus you can't beat the view.Ok, now DO NOT stay here if you are old, grumpy, do not like things that are ""different"" because you will be unhappy. Also DO NOT try to put your parents here when they visit because they will freak out. There was no way my parents would been happy in such tight and intimate quarters. The low bed would be impossible for them to get out of and too small (they might have to touch each other!!) plus most rooms have ""peek-a-boo"" showers which basically means there is no door on the shower and a window (with adjustable shutters) that open up into the room. If your parents have not seen each other naked in years they will now. Also if you tend to travel with huge suitcases there will be very little room for it.","Brooklyn, New York",1,4.0

It will be interesting to see how many return for a second stay! The hotel certainly has many stylish features. Cool room layouts have panoramic views over the city (along with a letter from the General Manager to remind you that the rest of New York City might be able to see everything you have on show!). Mine had a large wet room, with oversized tub - very nice - but then you had to cross the corridor to the tiny (shallow and badly designed) sink and minimal storage area. There was also no hook to hang your towel - which did not seem to go hand in hand with the note on your bed to change/not change your linen. The bed was very comfortable and there was a nice seating area. Great TV and also nice bathroom ammenities. The open plan design is great if you are on your own, but did not afford much privacy, if you are traveling with someone else. It is very much a room designed for a one/two night stay - not great for longer. The hotel has a good restaurant - which is certianly popular in the city and opens late into the night. Service was however patchy and this is a theme throughout the hotel. The Front Desk Team (especially The Concierge & Doormen) are more concerned in being one of the 'beautiful people', rather than offering great service. All the money seems to have been spent on the rooftop bar - which is certainly spectacular, but vastly overpriced and with poor service. It is only open from 4pm - 9pm, when the lights come on and everyone is kicked out. It is a private club later at night and I believe you need to have sold your soul to the devil to get in (no special priviledges for hotel guests). There is a great gym, with spectacular views. The crowd is chic corporate midweek, but decends to trashy out of towners at the weekend. If they worked on the service and making the hotel guests feel that they were a little more special than the walk in crowd, it would not be a bad option.

The gym has views only rivaled by the gym in Tokyo's Park Hyatt. Rooms too have great views - particularly those facing uptown. But views alone don't a great hotel make.The rooms are pokey and cramped. Closet space is practically non-existent. If traveling with a suit case prepare to trip over it while in the room - if traveling with two consider booking adjoining rooms. We felt as if we were staying in a caravan or winnebego.The concierge was sloppy and pretentious. We trusted her with a task of confirming restaurant bookings which proved either too much or too menial for her - either way it was messed up.Positioning-wise, this hotel is perfectly aimed at 20-somethings - it feels like a disco-hotel and has something of a scene attached to it. it certainly will not canabalise the Mercer's customer as it lacks the world-class service levels and discretion of its cooler sister hotel. i would suspect that it may not get a lot of repeat custom, and should enjoy its buzz status while it can.There is a club on the 18th floor which offers amazing 360 views of the city, but is not available to guests post 8pm Thu-Sun. It feels a tad too self-conscious but certainly worth scoping out for the vista. The club's loos offer great views externally, but the toilet was blocked when i tried to used it. I think the staff were too gorgeous to look after such trivialities. Half of the building's elevators will be closed off during the exclusive times to accomodate the club's guests rather than the hotel's.

I have felt ambivalent about the development of luxury hotels in downtown New York over the past several years. It's great to have options in the neighborhoods I most frequent, but the buildings have marred the landscape and the design elements often promote cheap, ostentatious settings rather than inviting and beautiful environments. The Standard, one of the most inspiring structures to rise in NYC in years, gets everything right. Its design is not only captivating but makes sense on the level of experience. It may be the exciting new place on the block, but this hotel is far from trendy. Our corner room on the 14th floor was small in terms of square feet, but the overall layout and design made the room feel expansive. Of course, the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city also promoted this. It was absolutely amazing to feel suspended over Manhattan in such a calming environment. There were many interesting elements to the design that defied the usual expectations of a hotel room--such as the open bathroom with no wall separating the shower area from the sink--that worked so well. The staff was warm and welcoming and attentive to all of our needs, including those of our dog. Anyone who prefers downtown to midtown for her/his NYC experience should definitely book a room at this hotel.

The Standard is in a fantastic location -- above the new High Line and steps from all the great restaurants in the Meatpacking District -- and is incredibly affordable. Although the rooms are a little small, even for New York standards, that hotel does the most it can with the space. The rooms have a nautical theme and floor to ceiling windows with spectacular views. The room was clean, there were good products, and nice sheets. Our room had a view of the High Line and the Hudson that was truly memorable.

Located in the Meat Packing District, though a bit far west so hard to get cabs and the like. The bed was very comfortable and waking to the view was marvelous.Cons: The service is, frankly, an embarrassment. A bag was dropped for us on Friday night, Saturday night it still hadn't been brought to the room. I called, they had no idea what I was talking about. I made them search and finally they found it and asked, as though I was bothering them, if I needed it brought up. Add to that the confusion of the desk staff who were clearly hired more based on their trendy appearances than their qualifications in hospitality. It would take two or three of them to handle simple requests like a new room key.We also had several people getting ready in the room for an event with hair & makeup people coming in to prep. The hotel was notified of this in advance and said it would be not a problem. The open shower (which is silly) has no way to be closed off from the rest of the room (frankly the entire bathroom is part of the suite). We asked that a Chinese curtain be brought in so one person could shower while the other was being prepped. The staff had nothing they could do and told us that it really wasn't something they could accommodate. I'm sorry, but when you're charging around $1000 a night for a room there should be NO request that is hard to accommodate. They finally brought up sheets & painter's tape to create a divider. It was a bad solution but go the job done.It should also be noted that the finishing in the hotel are embarrassing. The carpets in the hallways are cheap and poorly installed so they slip under your feet slightly as you walk. In the suite, the carpet had rough-cut edges against the walls, much akin to how carpet looks like when installed by you and your friends. The couch fabric (also used to cover the woefully small closet - with no shelves for clothing, only five hangers) was described by one person as ""a donkey blanket"" based on it's look & feel.Lastly, this was really one, not-so-big room. Bathroom, L-shaped couch sitting area & bed all open together. It is like a starter studio apartment with a kick-butt view. I generally expect suites to have two rooms with some divider between them, which this lacked.Frankly, this is a hotel that it would be very hard to recommend. I strongly recommend looking at the Gansevoort or Maritime before the Standard.",New York,2,2.0

I’m a sucker for water—lakes, oceans, rivers, ponds and fountains. Something about being by water makes me happy.The view of the river made me smile ear to ear. With floor to ceiling windows, the vista from our room in the 337-room Standard, located smack dab in one of the coolest parts of town, was jaw dropping.The book shaped hotel, built on huge concrete stilts over the newly opened Hi Line in the Meat Packing District, offers panoramic vistas of sky, water and land of lower Manhattan, the Hudson River, Statue of Liberty and New Jersey.It’s amazing.The hotel itself is a mish mash of super cool design. Unlike some boutique hotels where the designer picks a theme and carries it throughout, this one is more of a dazzling compilation of trendy and hip—maybe a little crazy.The lobby is updated retro—mauve and gray (think 80s?), molded mesh walls and lacquer yellow revolving door (60s?) and very current use of lighting. It’s in the floor, directing you to the check in areas—huge blocks of marble.Around the corner is a red lacquer bar area and the powder room is in-your-face sixties black and white psychedelicThe Grill on main floor could easily be transported to the Upper East Side. Cozy and warm, welcoming and nicely lit. It feels like a sophisticated gathering spot for women in Channel jackets and men in bow ties.And then there’s the newly opened 19th floor lounge—a must see spot if you are in the neighborhood—but be forewarned after 9 o’clock it is strictly velvet rope affair. You can’t get in unless you know the secret password or have a very good publicist.We lounged there from 4 to 6 pm one day, thoroughly enjoying lovely cocktails, snacks and the amazing changing view of a winter’s urban sunset. We left from there to catch our plane home. Couldn’t have been a nicer way to end our brief visit to the Big Apple.The Lounge reminds me of the old days of the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center. Art Deco references glitter in the carpet, a satin clad waitress who seemed to belong to a glamorous era long gone.Our room was tiny and utilitarian; feeling like a stateroom in a yacht with its wood panels, compact use of space. When I read that the designer was a Hollywood Set designer, some o f the annoying aspects made sense. Electrical outlets by the bed were so well hidden, I had to get on my hands and knees to find. The shower was open to the room with few barriers, creating a swimming pool effect on the shower floor. We had no place to put luggage or really store anything.When you think about it, set design isn’t about the function of the space; it’s about how it looks in a movie. Must admit. It looked fabulous.The views more than made up for the in conveniences.Even riding in the elevator is a visual treat. No ordinary standing and looking at the door or surreptitiously checking out the other guests. The elevator cabs—very dark—feature a video installation called “Civilization.” It takes riders on a whimsical journey from hell to heaven visualized using hundreds of feature film clips stitched together seamlessly into a video mural. Definitely worth the ride.Truly, the Standard knows how to put on a show.www.designdestinations.wordpress.com",grand rapids,10,4.0

On the positive side, meatpacking is a vibrant lively area with great restaurants and up-market shopping and The Standard is located right in the heart of this. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, rooms are a little small but typical of NYC, but there are great views across the city. We had a room on the 11th floor and from our bath we could look out across the city, taking advantage of the floor to ceiling window.The bistro and the grill were both pretty good, standard American dining but definitely worth trying. Now for the major thing to be warned about...the picturesque lounge bar on the 18th floor closes to residents at 9pm and becomes a nightclub! That means that because it is located on the top floor, the sound travels right the way down through the whole building...on the night we arrived we were woked by throbbing bass at 2am, luckily we had ear-plugs that we could use. The funny thing about the lounge/club on the top floor after 9pm is that as a guest you are not allowed to go in! So you have to put up with the noise but can't join in, it is a little silly but i am sure they are making a large amount of money by hiring the space out. If you want a drink in the bistro after 11 also be warned it is extremely busy and you may struggle to be served.

The bed is SUPER SUPER comfortable. The TV is HUGE and easy to figure out. Gets lots of HD channels. The view is spectacular. The location amazing. The service top-notch.

It is conveniently located, we subwayed, walked or cabbed everywhere in Manhattan with no problems.The only warning I would give is everyone here is fashionable.

I was really looking forward to staying here so I didn't have any doubts when we decided to come to New York for our 7-night honeymoon, impressed by the design proposal and the massive views of The Standard Suite (room 8.23).When we booked the room, I made it clear we wanted to pay cash for our room, which it didn't seem to be a problem when I contacted the hotel. However, our problems with the service started at the check in: the person who received us was not prepared for this method of payment, uncomfortable and almost annoyed, insisting in authorizing the full amount of our stay in our credit card. We offered the cash deposit of all the money which was, to my surprise, not accepted. He really wanted the credit card... after a few times trying to authorize it (we told him again and again that we didn't have high limits available on our credit card, hey, we had just payed for our wedding!), he finally took the cash. Took too long, and it was embarrassing as there was a long line forming after us.We got sick on the first days and we had to ask for some salt, a request received with irony by the room service staff and ignored. Had to call again to finally get the salt... absurd.Then we ran out of shower gel. How come house keeping does not check something basic as replacing your shower gel? Had to call for more, took forever, and when I was just about to do my second call, waiting wrapped in a towel, it arrived. The concierge service was fine, doing reservations and giving you recommendations in the neighborhood but, as the text messages they supposedly were sending to us were not arriving to our room phone, in the end, our impression was very poor.And, speaking of phones, ours doesn't work for local calls (they are supposed to be free but we're using our cell phones - from spain - instead). Whenever we try to call, we get a ""please hang up"" message as if the phone was blocked. I didn't even bother calling to have it unblocked/fixed. I would probably have to call twice, get upset, etc. so I left it the way it is as I really don't feel like interacting with the staff.The good side? the room has impressive views and nice designed furniture. Bathtub by Philip Starck, all very nice indeed, specially if you're design oriented and really cares about this stuff, as we do. But a good hotel, those who stay on for long, is not only made by good views and design. It needs to excel in service.

We stayed in a corner room but the room was the size of an average shoebox. The bathroom was home depot deluxe, without bath and there wasn't really a bed, more a mattress on the ground. The service was pretty poor, room service plates which weren't picked for over 24 hours in the hallway and the annoying video animation in the elevator drives you nuts after 3 days. The location is great, the beergarten is a killer but the restaurant is o so bad. We ordered soft boiled eggs for breakfast but we had to sent them back 3 times because they forgot to boile them. The waitress said the kitchen had difficulty boiling eggs so advised us to order something else (no joke). There was a party going on in the hotel on halloween night untill 3am orso which is great if you want to have a rave in your room but a bit annoying if you want to get some sleep.

The hotel is very modern and very trendy, which may not be to everyone's taste. The room was great; a view of the Empire State Bldg. and surroundings. The peekaboo shower was certainly an interesting experience. Considering that rooms in New York are notoriously small, the rooms here are surprisingly spacious.

We spent 3 nights in this UBER trendy hotel to finish off our fab NYC visit.The area: wow....I must start by saying that the Meatpacking District is so very cool, and has a trendy, underground feel to it. It may not be THE in-area right now (Hell's Kitchen is hotting up big time), but it is still the Meatpacking district, point. Nice shops, great restaurants (we frequented Pastis more than once), the High Line park is lovely and gives a great chance to explore the area. We really enjoyed exploring on foot and walked all the way down Bleecker Street until we hit Soho for great shopping and scene. We even went so far as to walk all the way from Brooklyn Bridge up through Tribeca then Soho and up to The Standard hotel. Walk, walk, walk....staying at this hotel puts you in a great position to explore by foot.The hotel staff: All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I have read other reviews saying that they felt the staff would barely look up and offer assistance. I personally think though that some people confuse the hotel service you would expect to find in a 5 star chain to the service one simply must expect at a trendy, boutique-esque hotel. All staff were amazing. We had room service, bellboy bags to room, assistance at the front desk on a few occasions...each and every time, without fail, we were given friendly, cool service with a smile...not fake, not over the top...just what one would expect. No robots here...just staff with personality. The hotel: ooh la la...from it's truly unique exterior to it's super trendy interior, The Standard really knows how to put on a show. The design is supercool. The bright yellow table/bench combos adorn the entrance, leading to revolving doors, bringing you into a slick, sexy lobby. Round the corner are the pitch black elevators...quit complaining that they are too dark people! It's all about design. So you know...the elevators are pitch black, you are in darkness, apart from 2 adjacent video screens with a superb, ongoing digital video collage...I seriously loved the ride up and down to our 14th floor. The screens DO provide some light, so it's not like you are fumbling around in the dark. We arrive on the 14th floor, heading down the minimal corridor to room 1414. The numbers are embossed in HUGE, vertically, on the door itself, as well as on small plates next to the door (I wonder if they had to add those because the complainers couldn't 'see' the numbers on the doors originally). We enter the room and need a moment to compose ourselves because the view just takes our breath away. We see ALL of downtown, the Hudson River, Jersey City, Madame Liberty in the distance, High Line park below. The floor to ceiling, room wide, windows are just superb. And yes...people can see into the rooms so beware, unless you like to put on a show for those down below. The room itself is also quite simply amazing. We took a Deluxe King...perfect choice, room enough to swing quite a few cats, very clever use of space and design. The bed was very, very comfortable, with the loveliest squishiest pillows I have slept on in a long time. The bath was more than big enough for the 2 of us...and if you are into that kinda thing, 3 is still not a crowd in that tub. The closet space is more than plenty for a typical weekend away in New York...we solved the suitcase 'space' issue by putting our cases in the corner of the room on a table, voila...nothing worth complaining about. The toiletries are provided by Kiss My Face...hide them daily so you keep getting more to take back home, they are lovely!The ONLY 1 downside to our room was that on Saturday night, we actually wanted an early night, but there is a bar down the road which does have an outside area belting music till the early hours. Brass Monkey I think it is called. The sound is muffled, the room insulation is very good, but still, I did use earplugs to drown out the slight noise. The issue is solved very easily...just use earplugs, or go down and join the party. This would not put me off staying at the Standard again.All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. It's all about design, cool, great atmosphere, catering to couples/singles...not families (I secretly like that fact). I will most certainly, 100% be coming back for a stay when next in New York.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands",49,5.0

No doubt the views are outstanding from each room. From mine I could see the Statue of Liberty in the distance. The bellmen are very cute and pleasant. HOWEVER....the bed was very lumpy and so uncomfortable; my room was not made up one day during my 3 day stay; the staff at the desk had lots of attitude; it is difficult to see elevator floor numbers on the panel; no suitable lamp for bedtime reading; if you crack a window for some air the street noise is very loud; car wasn't brought around despite my asking for it one hour before I checked out so then I waited another 1/2 hour; waiter at the oh so trendy Grill was rude removing plates during conversation; we couldn't find the entrance door when we first drove up to the hotel!!! My brother and his son are architects and they joined me for an evening meal. I am a designer. We appreciate the avant garde ambience of the hotel for sure......BUT....good form MUST follow function. There is a poor choice of materials (already deeply scratched black plastic tables in each room)(or cream rug on floor already showing stains) frequently and the lighting is intentionally minimal....but ya need to see your floor number in the elevator!

Then there are issues like dirty carpets, trim falling off in room and overall low quality materials poorly installed, bathrooms designed in such a way that the shower floods the entire floor, ridiculously small closets that cannot hold more then a couple of days of clothes for two and nowhere to keep the then nec. suitcases filled with remaining clothes (and no luggage stand for it either).

Hope you didn't bring a lot of clothes because there's virtually no closet space and about 3-4 hangers, make sure you get one at least with the four 8""x8"" shelves.WC has no storage, no lock and a huge gap in the hinge side... meaning make sure there's toilet paper in there first since housekeeping doesn't replace it, and expect no privacy since the design and construction telegraphs every sound.Speaking of sound, don't stay on the ""Superior"" side if you want any rest, you'll be right above this gem of a noise maker called the ""Brass Monkey"" that's open till 4am. Yes that wonderful build quality I told you about before means you'll hear every hoot, holler and bass note that comes out of their outdoor section.

The tiny room (over $600 a night with taxes) was uncomfortably small for two people but definitely the best tiny room we’ve experienced. A huge window overlooking the East River, and a window between the bedroom and the bathroom helped opened the room up. However the queen bed, pushed into a corner, made sleeping uncomfortable for the inside person…and ridiculously inconvenient when it came to getting up in the middle of the night. I’d be very comfortable here by myself, but for two grow-ups it felt downright silly…not to mention utterly overpriced. That said, the bed was comfortable, the bed linens and towels great, and the lighting well thought-out. The big TV at the foot of the bed, in front of the huge window, seems gigantic in such a pint-sized room.However, design is everywhere…every little bit of this place is designed for visual interest. I especially loved the black tiles in the bathroom and WC. However, turn on the faucet in the bathroom and water cascades out of the sink soaking an unsuspecting handwasher. And try to plug in your computer and you have to either unplug the radio or a lamp, or perch awkwardly on the bed. (I consider the lack of convenient electrical outlets totally unforgiveable in a new, purpose-built hotel.) I also thought the lack of a cordless phone was very lame. To continue, the closet was so tiny that there was barely room for one day’s worth of clothes next to the thick robes and ironing board. Frankly, hotel developer Andre Balazs should know better by now.The staff was friendly and accommodating, and being in such a creative environment balances, somewhat, the annoyances. My two favorite features were the video collage in the elevators and the knitted cozies slipped over the steel stanchions outside. The location is lots of fun. The meatpacking district seems to be getting better all the time. The elevated Highline Park is a big draw. The area is full of New Yorkers but hip internationals seem to dominate.

We have walked around the Village numerous times,, but have always gotten lost, what with its narrow streets intersecting this way and that, without the perfect grid system of midtown streets. We also have been following the High Line project--the redevelopment of an old elevated railroad platform into a lovingly and cleverly designed landscaped walkway-- as well as the construction of the Standard Hotel straddling it. So when we discovered the Standard would be open during our planned visit, we eagerly booked there. We were able to get a good web-only rate similar to the soft opening rate the hotel initially offered.The Neighbourhood.  The hotel is located in the Meatpacking district just north of the West Village. It straddles the High Line and is quite an impressive sight, 18 stories tall. We first visited this area when the boutique Jeffrey opened on 14th St. a number of years ago . Back then the area truly did consist of mostly meatpacking facilities. A few of these still remain, but most have become designer shops, clubs, lounges and restaurants. The nightlife here is very active--weekdays and weekends we witnessed crowds at 2 am and later--people who require very little sleep and/or don't go to work until the afternoon, if at all. Over the course of our 6 day stay, we saw exactly 3 children in the area, all during daylight hours and none within the hotel itself. The hotel offers queen or king rooms only; 2 people maximum per room.The nearest subway stop is about a 5 minute walk away.The Hotel Public Rooms.There is a large outdoor seating area in front of the lobby, which is smallish but stylish, a bit retro looking. The elevators all have 2 unique video screens playing a mesmerizing continuously scrolling presentation, with music. There are several lounge spaces on the ground floor, both indoors and out, with the largest being outdoors under (and protected by) the High Line--very popular. The restaurant The Standard Grill is adjacent, also with indoor and outdoor seating. Not yet opened is the top (18th) floor lounge/club, which apparently will have pool, and is certain to be a hot spot once it opens in about a month. It will surely be a velvet rope type of place, and I would expect there may be difficulty (or at least a wait) for guests just trying to return to their rooms. Even now, over the weekend there was security at the elevators, asking for room keys and checking guest names from a list. There is a large gym on the 17th floor with fabulous views in 3 directions, including the Hudson River. There is no business center (but Wifi is free) or spa.The Guestrooms.Our web rate was for a Standard Queen, but we were upgraded to a south-facing Superior Queen, a slightly smaller room but with a better view. Apparently all the Standard rooms face north, where one gets a glimpse of the river. High Line and Empire State Building, but mostly one sees a large building being built one block north. From the south-facing rooms, there are virtually no buildings taller that the hotel, so one can clearly see Downtown, the southern tip of the High Line, much better views of the Hudson River, New Jersey and the Statue of Liberty. We were informed at check-in as well as via a letter delivered to the room that the floor-to-ceiling windows were non-reflective, so without your drapes drawn, people below can see EVERYTHING, and this apparently has been an issue, based on things we'd read online. Indeed, whenever we looked down at the High Line, there were always people staring up at the hotel.The room was not large, but I've seen smaller in New York, and things were designed to maximize space--a built-in seating area, 2 sides of the bed placed flush against the wall (the person with the stronger bladder should sleep against the wall). The colour scheme is black, white and beige. The flat screen HD TV froze a lot.The bathroom was tiled in black with a laboratory-like sink and counter fixture. The bath products were cleverly packaged. Very early TA reviews of the hotel mentioned the flooding situation involving the shower, and we bore witness to this in our room. The shower is not enclosed, with only a small glass partition between it and the sink. Only the water temperature can be controlled, not the volume (this is true of practically every hotel shower we've used for the past few years), so the water naturally flows out onto the floor, which is not sloped enough towards the drain. We learned quickly to form a dam using a towel (very large and fluffy by the way) to contain the water. Indeed, after showering, the driest place in the bathroom was in the bathtub, which was huge and open to the bedroom with shutters. The toilet was in a separate water closet.The Staff and Service.The staff was all quite young and stylish, courteous and helpful for the most part. Male staffers seem to outnumber the females. Our one exception was with an unfriendly room service attendant, but this was after midnight and he was doing double duty--taking an order on a mobile phone while delivering our order.This was a fun hotel in a fun location. It's not a 5 star place, nor does it strive to be, but it delivered on most fronts. Again, it's not a place for families with small children or friends who are not intimate with each other. or for business.

I've stayed in both the LA Standard hotels with work and thought for my trip to NY I would try the New York one: it didn't disappoint. Innovative decor (and dreamlike elevator video was entrancing) and having floor to ceiling windows was amazing for a visitor to NY.I especially loved the super deep bath with a window through to the room to watch TV after a day pounding the pavements! As I was alone for a few days in NY, it was so nice to come back to a beautiful room every night. I think I would have been rather depressed in an average hotel. Such good value for money- don't put up your prices when you get really popular!Just amazing. I would live at The Standard if I could. Modern and trendy and quirky without being pretentious- the staff were all really helpful and friendly, and knew where the great places to go are eg Vintage shopping and Frueza Brutal that I can imagine a lot of hotels wouldn't tell you about. Great location- right next to Diana Fustenberg's studio and not far from Bleaker St which I loved. Even the room service guys would stand and have a chat about your day. Food amazing at The Grill too- I remember the brioche from the LA Standard and was really chuffed to see it again!All I want to know is- where did you get the kissing dogs salt and pepper shakers- so so cute.Thanks so much, I fell in love with NY and this hotel.

I also received an upgrade from a standard to a superior queen room. I knew what to expect upon arrival as I had researched the hotel before visiting. Well, many reviews got it right.

I didn't try the hotel restaurant. My only complaint is that -- even though the hotel is brand new, and, in fact, still under construction on the top floors -- the room was already showing signs of a little wear and tear (broken lamp shade, and mold on the wall behind a curtain, where there must have been a leak of some kind).

Beautiful and simple decor, amazing room set up and incredibly comfortable beds and room layout, it reminded me of some top tier places in Norway and Switzerland in simplicity and elegance. The staff was amazingly helpful on several occasions when I needed help. The uniforms are hip, the place is up and coming - but NO ONE that visits will be out of place, uncomfortable, or even put off by the style...it's not ""uber hip"" but very cool.

Yes it has a great view as long as you look out to the river, just don't look down at all the trash behind the buildings below. Yes it is close to the nightlife, but that is a double edged sword as the the builder obviously cut corners on the glass selection to prevent all that noise below from interferring with your quiet time. I believe I have stressed the two good points. The rooms are so affected that I could go on and on, but some of the highlights are that the only place to use a blow dryer is in the wet room (which was the all in one bathroom). I believe most people know you shouldn't use a hair dryer standing in a wet area. At this hotel you have little choice. The toilet in a ""closet"" ont he opposite side of the hall had all the makings of a claustrophbic bowel movement. There wasn't even enough room in the the toilet room to house an additional roll of toilet paper. Better not get stuck there with the last sheet becasue the extra roll was stored in the closet across the hallway. I could go on and on, but the point is really, whoever designed this place has put way to much emphasis on being cool rather than designing an effective room. As well they have hired a staff of under 30 types with little hotel experience, and when confronted with an issue mostly just are to cool to deal with it.. If you are young and well off and don't know what a good hotel experince should really be like, this is the palce for you. Oh did I mention they missed my wake up call two days in a row.

Being a new hotel I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have to say it is an amazing place. Most hotels have a certain atmosphere about them. You know what I mean, some scream 'business' or 'budget' or 'help i'm stuck in the 90's' but with The Standard there is none of that kind of aura. It's a place where you can be who you want to be and do what you want to do. Everything even down to the design of the rooms has a sense of fun about it (even some of the items in the Mini Bar)!My room had an amazing view down the Hudson towards The Statue of Liberty and downtown. While not being one of the biggest rooms, the clever layout and floor to ceiling glass made it seem spacious and roomy with a good sized and very comfortable bed and its own 'lounge area'. Other clever design details allow you to sit and enjoy a movie while lounging in the massive bathtub thanks to the window between the bathroom and the sleeping area. The overall design is spectacular and everything has been thought about down to the last detail. There is even a rather clever animation of 'heaven to hell' in each of the lifts. In fact I would love to have that as a screen saver for my Mac!The staff are friendly and helpful and don't pressure you. The Concierge even managed to get me a table at short notice for the newly opened and very popular Standard Grill which is superb. My sister has even gone as far as declaring it her new favorite New York restaurant! Room Service is great, efficient and very reasonably priced as is the Mini Bar and there is a great movie/tv/music choice on the generously sized flat screen TV. I also had free wi-fi which based on my stay at another NY hotel seems to be quite rare. As for downsides I don't think I could name any that I had during my stay.

The neighborhood is great as well; it's pretty much the center of hippness these days. The only misses are that if you are expecting total perfection in design and ""fit and finish,"" particularly in the rooms, you won't find it. What you will experience is sort of like the difference between furniture from West Elm and DWR. The former is cool looking, but maybe not so well built or thought out as the latter. I say this only because this place has received so much ink for the design that if you arrived thinking it would just be high end everything, it's not quite there and you'll be disappointed.

I am not sure that we have ever gotten such good service (and with a light friendly touch by the way, not the heavy duty ""sir"" and ""madam"" kind of manner which is in it's own way a bit annoying) in a New York hotel, at any price level. The rooms were on the smaller side but the view overwhelmingly compensates for the lack of square footage.

The concierge was fun, friendly and certainly gave us a fabulous recommendation for dinner. Later when we saw him, he followed up and was genuinely pleased we enjoyed his recommendation. Once in my lovely room I had some technical challenges with getting on the wireless network - within five minutes someone came up to my room, helped me and got me connected - all with a smile!

Being right over the Highline is amazing too. Room was very clean, quiet and comfortable for the most part.The negative: The build quality of this hotel is not great--i think they either built too quickly or cut corners. The door didn't close properly ever b/c it seemed frame was warped--i had to slam it shut and literally kick it open several times. The hotel is brand new, this shouldn't happen. The cable went out multiple times in two days. The check out from TV didn't work when i left. When you are on the Highline and look up at the hotel, you'll see how the cement frame from floor to floor on outside has shifted in all different directions--it is not a straight line--just take a look when you are there and you'll see. The room is a little cold and uninviting. I get what they were going for, mid-century/Danish, but it somehow misses the mark and feels more like the inside of an RV with strange bolsters and railing around the room. There is a misplaced peice of furniture that is the bar that sits in the hallway; it looks like it was an afterthought and left over from a previous owner, waisting precious space. The staff, though extremely polite and friendly, are just not up to hotel staff at other established hotels--it feels like college kids are running the hotel. It could be that the property is still green and will work the kinks out, but right now, it just not there. Finally, the lobby, though trying to be cool is really unimpressive in person and too small in scale. Would I stay here again, probably not--there are better hotels near by that have a better vibe and energy than this place. Was it a bad stay, not by any means, just misses the mark.",Los Angeles,1,3.0

For the most part, the staff was lovely, but I do concur with an earlier reviewer who referred to them as hipster. Mind you, if you are staying in the Meat Packing District, you need to buy into it and it was no surprise that the front office staff were all very attractive, young, stylish and well-coiffed. The housekeeping staff were all lovely and attractive and overly, far more friendly than some of the young front end people. Overall, the housekeeping staff was terrific! The rooms have a bit of a dorm room meets camper trailer feel to them. That said, I was paying the soft rate while they complete construction and have no complaints about that at all. The beds were very comfortable an the quality of linens was nice. I slept really well. But the white quilted blankets made me feel like I was in school and the seating area totally reminded me of camping when I was a kid. I would not be surprised if the table collapses into a bed. I do have one big complaint about this hotel. They need to seriously upgrade their product line of soaps and shampoos. They are also just a bit DUDE on that front. Spruce bubble bath? Ick! All the scents were very masculine. I'm not looking for super flowery either, but I don't want to come out of the bath smelling like a Christmas tree. The bubble bath and shower gel were a huge disappointment, especially given the massive bathtub. The packaging of all that stuff was also terrible. It looked like generic shampoos you might pick up at Walmart. They really need to upgrade that stuff, especially once they are off the soft rates and people are paying full price. The towels, however, are fantastic! Nothing like a massive bathsheet. A bathrobe would have been nice too. In general, I had a great stay and given where all my friends live, it was the perfect neighbourhood for me, but I'm not sure I would pay full price for one of these rooms. It just doesn't feel that luxurious. Clean and comfortable? Absolutely! Luxury? Not really. But perhaps that not what they are aiming for. The architecture of this building is great!",Montreal,0,4.0

We reserved 2 standard queen rooms. We had to beg for the reservation since normally they have a two night minimum, but when I explained this was a special occasion (our daughter's 21st birthday), they were kind enough to make an exception. We couldn't get in on the soft opening deal of $195/night, but felt the $265/a night quoted price was pretty good for NYC. We were wowed by the contemporary decor that greeted us in the lobby. I had not been to NYC in 16 years, and was quite surprised by the friendliness of the staff, not even a molecule of snootiness--warm, friendly, fun, and helpful. We were blown away when we were told BOTH rooms had been upgraded in honor of our daughter's birthday. Our daughter was given a river view room that was mind-blowing. Although all rooms have floor to ceiling, wall to wall windows with amazing views, at the foot of her bed was a panoramic view of the Hudson river that she will never forget. Even the statue of Liberty was visible. The totally full moon and fireworks display rather added to the excitement of this awesome view in the evening. For New York standards, the room was nicely sized, with a nice contemporary table, huge tub, and rainforest shower. Big fluffy towels (lots of them), and an amazingly well stocked minibar were part of the charm. Our second room (upgraded to a standard King) had a great city view showcasing the Empire State Building. The bed was so comfortable, with wonderful linens. The flat screened TV, glass-walled rain forest shower (in the middle of the room) and comfy contemporary chairs (to position for staring out the window or using at the table) were nice touches as well. The Elevators--so fun! Cartoon/animated-like displays of ""Wonder World"" (hard to describe but a must-see) were whimsical, entertaining, and unique. Clearly this hotel does not take itself overly seriously as so many NY hotels do. The staff courteously accommodated every request--supplying shaving cream and toothpaste on request, and answering all questions regarding directions, travel times, etc. Room service breakfast no longer free and restaurant not yet open, but we ordered coffee and rolls and it was extremely reasonable and prompt. The only suggestion I would make is installing black-out linings behind the drapes (the sun REALLY makes itself known in the morning), but on second thought, who has time to sleep in while visiting the Big Apple? The hip meat packing district where the hotel is located is really convenient in terms of being in a central location and very ""mid town buzzy"" and young. I highly recommend this hotel. although apparently all the views are great, if at all possible, splurge and get a room with a river view, it's spectacular and worth it for a memorable experience in New York.","Chicago, IL",60,5.0

Everything was perfect for me during my stay - from the friendly reception staff to the concierge guys who always left their station to hail me a cab to the gorgeous model guy who brought me my in-room complimentary breakfast. I loved the room - stunning views of the river (i could see Liberty Statue clearly) and lower Manhattan clearly visible through the floor-ceiling windows, nice comfy bed low to the floor with plenty of pillows, convenient plug outlets for my laptop and cell. The complimentary toiletries (Kiss My Face brand) were ample sized, larger than norm - face cream was 2oz.. Love, loved the deep tub. After my 13 hr flight, it was a treat to fill it and soak, with and be able to enjoy the sunset - clear view through the bedroom. I did not experience any air conditioning problems mentioned in some of the reviews here - my room maintained perfect ambient temps for me. I was neither hot nor cold. The hotel is in a great neighbourhood with lots of boutiques and restaurants. My room was directly above the Brass Monkey - their patio was packed till 3am. I felt safe walking around at night. The minibar was stocked with lots of different options for alcohol & non-alcoholic drinks (bottles were not ""mini"" sized either) and snacks. The prices were really reasonable and it wasn't one of those cheesy spring-loaded fridges either. I can see that this hotel is good for singles or young/hip couples. Not kid friendly rooms or for those who don't like the modern look and decor. I wish they had low flow toilets - that was the one unit that was not modern.

A little on the small side (not much room to have two suitcases open) but the floor to ceiling views were fantastic. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the design of the rooms. The bathroom was quite unique with a great two person bath and the views are still visible from the bath.

Location is simply perfect. Staff is extremely nice. Rooms are beautiful, with the floor to ceiling glass walls providing spectacular view. We had a corner room facing north-east with view of mid-town, but it seems that the south facing rooms have a better view of the Hudson.Bear in mind that the hotel still lacks many facilities - there is a lounge, but with no food, there are no fitness or spa facilities, but then the price is reduced until the full opening.Definitely a fun stay","Tel Aviv, Israel",197,4.0

If they can keep this level of service up they will really put this hotel on the map. The location of the hotel is great, although we found some cabs had a hard time getting to the front door sometimes. The old cobblestone streets, the fantastic restaurants and bars, great shopping in the area all make it a very desirable area to be in. The hotel won't be complete until the summer, but you can't hear or see any construction. I can only imagine how amazing this place will be when the restaurants and the high-line park are complete. The rooms are small and as others have noted the bathroom was our only complaint. Also make sure you don't get a room number that ends in .01, they are adjacent to the elevators and you can hear them coming up and down. The view from the room is amazing.This is a great hotel and make sure you take advantage of the soft opening prices. We will be back.",Toronto,89,5.0

The tiny room - ours (908) overlooked one of the last meatpacking plants, and with a bird's eye view, we watched the trucks ride off loaded with carcases. Actually, it was ""gritty"" and fascinating and somehow very urban and real. Love the floor to ceiling windows (one opens - yes!) and it's great to have a table rather than desk (free wifi). No tub in this room, or robes for that peek-a-boo shower. Definitely needs a new shower head, as water spills all over the floor. Bed and linens were as fine as any I have stayed in NYC. Free continental breakfast was a plus - take advantage of transition rates while you can. We heard no construction or water pipe noise. Oh, and the drink prices in the downstairs bar are very reasonable; DJ plays on weekends. We used subway (10 min walk) - not as convenient as midtown if you are a theater buff, but we liked the varied neighborhood shops and restaurants. With Vince and Theory and Tory Burch shops open nearby, GAP won't be far behind. Go before the scene starts to look like Soho.","Murchison, New Zealand",10,5.0

Pretty cool actually. The floor to ceiling windows make for a great view and I loved the 1970's-style appointments. The building itself, is an architectural masterpiece.

We absolutely loved our stay - it was an extraordinary experience.Our room (9.20) had an amazing view on the Hudson river. We looked right at the (far away) Statue of Liberty and could even see the Brooklyn Bridge from our room. The floor to ceiling windows are really great,The rooms are small but very nice:- comfy small bed- great bathroom (albeit very wet as has been said before) with a very big tub- big screen tv (which we didnt use because we rather looked at the view)- big mini barWas everthing perfect? Well almost: if we'd have to name things, we found that there is not much space for your stuff in the room (just one closet behind a curtain) and we missed some accessories like a trash can. But really, this is nitpicking.The only thing we found a bit annoying is that when the neighbours are running the water it is so loud that we couldn't hear our own music (which nicely ran from our iPod in the iPod dock clock radio/speakerset!). For a modern building it seems odd that the pipes are not isolated.As for the hotel being under construction: we didn't notice this at all. Everything operates fine.The lobby/bar is great and the outside terrace will be great in the summer. Staff was very friendly. What else can you wish for?The neighbourhood - this is really one of the best area's in NY we think. Nice restaurants, nice shops and close to the West Village - which we also love. Great restaurant across the street from the Standard if you like Asian food: Spice Garden. Pastis was nice too. To avoid: Revel: they lure you in with a fixed price menu and then tell you they only serve it until 19.30. But even worse: service and food were bad.To get back to The Standard: subway is a 5 min walk from the hotel and it has a straight connection to JFK (AirTrain at subway stop Jamaica)Lastly the rates are very good right now as they're preview rates because they're still finishing the hotel. But despite higher rates next time: we'll surely come back here!","Utrecht, The Netherlands",36,5.0

We had reasonably priced drinks at the lounge off the very cool lobby..We enjoyed our free Continental breakfast along with a delicious herb and goat cheese omelet that was brought to our room each morning.

We pulled up to this place, and the decor from the yellow chairs outside and the yellow doors is just amazing. I had to drive around the block once because I didn't know where to leave my car, but on the second time around - got so lucky and found a spot literally right next to the door. If you are just staying over on a weekend...you are allowed to park there and I recommend it as it saved me the $55 valet charge! The bellhop was nice as can be and took our bags for us as soon as I parked. We arrived at around 3:30pm and our room was not ready yet, however they offered us each a free drink which we were glad to take. An hour later, our room still was not ready (I was starting to get a little upset) but another complimentary drink each saved that from happening!) Finally, our room was ready, just a normal queen room with an ""Empire View"" What a tremendous view of the empire state building from our floor to ceiling windows! At night it was lit up for Valentines day in white red and pink!...so romantic and so wonderful. The room was perfect. A typical smaller NYC room, however it was very roomy with the most comfortable bed I have slept in in years. There is a nice 42 inch flat screen on the wall with a nice sitting area. One thing I would say about these rooms...dont go with someone you dont know very well! (and I mean very well!) The shower is completly see through. As you sit on the bed, you can see directly into the shower through the glass - very neat if your with your girlfried/wife..not so neat if your with a co-worker!! The bathroom is private, with a door. The tub is massive-and the shower was wonderful! There is no door on the shower so the floor can get a little wet! I had flowers waiting in the room for my girlfriend, which came out perfect from the conceirge! In the morning, just a phone call away was a commplimentary breakfast-brought straight to the room. Coffee, OJ, and pastries were perfect on a Sunday morning...and I didnt have to get out of bed! Overall a WONDERFUL hotel-with extremely accomodating (and good looking) staff!!

The hotel is still not complete and won't be for some time, I guess, but do not be afraid to book a room in the meantime. I didn't hear or see any evidence of the construction once inside the building, which is pretty impressive. And the staff does everything it can to make your stay comfortable. I was particularly impressed with the concierge--she actually KNEW the area unlike so many other concierges who take up space behind a desk and merely recommend people to the same 2 restaurants. I was trying to figure out what to do with my afternoon and she knew where I could get a haircut, where the best art gallery was, what the exhibits were like at a small nearby museum, what spas were good, where I should get a drink and where I should get dinner all within the neighborhood and her recommendations were all spot on. Management clearly understands good staffing.That leads me to the best thing about this hotel--its location. This area is my favorite part of NYC. The restaurants and clubs are plentiful and good. And the buildings aren't so high. It's authentic NYC. And to be able to walk back to the hotel after experiencing it all is a plus for me.My room at The Standard was good, although not super unique. But absolutely no complaints. Floor to ceiling windows create the view, a well-appointed and comfortable bed make for a good night of sleeping. As others have mentioned, the shower is separated from the bedroom by floor to ceiling clear glass, which I thought was pretty damn sexy. (Too bad the shower's design seems a little off as water was pouring into the bathroom and into the living room rug. I didn't mind it but I felt bad for the housekeeping staff.) I'll definitely be heading back when it's complete to see what else it has to offer.","Washington DC, District of Columbia",44,4.0

Andre Balasz and his team really know how to put their stamp on things and create an experience that is so special. From the killer mini bar (although it is hardly mini), to the so very well thought out appointments, everything feels hand picked and just works perfectly. The bed was heavenly and the sheets were very high in thread count. The room somehow feels a bit like a cruise ship cabin and as with the other reviews, the views of New York City are by far the best I've ever experienced in a NYC hotel.The staff was incredibly accommodating and attentive...and QUICK! And I can't go on without mentioning how gorgeous the staff is! Wow. The lobby bar is really chic and sexy but is the only lounge open at this time.The hotel is only about half finished but they have made sure that you almost don't notice- they have an awesome variety of menus from restaurant in the area that deliver and the free breakfast delivered to our room within minutes of calling was delicious - scones and croissants and excellent coffee and OJ. I am anxious to see the rest of the space and excited to frequent the top floor 360 degree view bar and restaurant. And they are supposedly building a restaurant and beer garden under the Highline - too cool.

Although, lots of confusion about late check out next morning and staff unclear how to resolve until we spoke with the manager. Room was minimal, and quite lovely.

Awesome rate for NYE $195 for superior queen.Check in was simple, can tell they are still working on the process, as the property has only been open for a few weeks, and is still under construction.Room was located on 8th floor, hallway lighting a little to much for me, a radiant orange glow, not really mood lighting for me but was a different approach.Immediately, when walked into room , awesome view of the hudson and downtown, floor to ceiling windows. Bathroom was to the right (sink, soaking tube and shower), I tripped going into the bathroom, floor raised with glossy black tiles. A little to modern for my taste but unique. Bed faced windows and TV was on a stand directly in front of the bed, and a small sitting area with a table and bench seating across the wall. Again awesome view from bed, but close shade at night, the sun this morning was blinding.One thing about this particular room , do not stay with someone whom you do not intimately, as the shower/bathing area is completely open to the bed area. You can jump into the tub from the bed, as there is just a open frame behind the bed directly into the tub.Only issue I had with my room was the shower, upon showering, the floor was apparently not graded properly and the water was flowing into the common area, when it should have gone down the drain in the floor. I had to use the majority of the towels to soak up the water on the floor in front of the sink. To the hotels credit, we received a $50 credit from the hotel.Forgot to mention the toilet was in a small enclosure (with a door with a mirror) to the left as you walk into the room.Overall, a nice hotel, nice staff, awesome view, and for the cost on a holiday in NYC a great stay.Time will tell when the hotel is ""complete"" how the Standard do in the city.",Metro NYC Area,1,2.0
