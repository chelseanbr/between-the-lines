Room was clean, beds were comfortable and the room size was good for NYC. Breakfast was ok with a good selection of options, however be sure to avoid between 8-10 as it does get busy. When it is busy, it is painful and we did a couple of times go out and buy breakfast, which is a little bit of false economy as we had paid for it in the hotel price, but the area was too small to be comfortable eating.All of the staff were friendly and helpful. Free coffee and hot chocolate in the room and hotel lobby. The location is right in the middle of midtown so really handy for first time visitors to NYC. We picked this hotel because it's close to major subways and Port Authority. Would definitely visit again.Recommended. I wanted to give it a full 5 stars, but for 2 of the days we were there, one lift was out of service and when you are on the 8th floor, that is a little grinding on how long it takes to get a lift fixed....","Birmingham, United Kingdom",115,4.0

The lobby looks new and beautiful, while the rooms are old and tired-- The toilet paper holders hang down broken, the bedside phone was DISGUSTING and looked like someone spilt coffee on it and never cleaned it up.When I walked into the room, the TV was broken so I called down to the desk. I ultimately got the TV to work, went to call down to tell the front desk and the phone wouldn't work. About half of the time, the phone worked, which from a safety perspective, is very worrisome. The night before departure, I confirmed a 1 PM check out with the front desk. The morning of check out, I was woken up at 8:30 AM by housekeeping knocking on my door. This shows me that either the departments at the hotel do not communicate, or they don't care. In a half-asleep rush to get up to tell the housekeeper about my late check out, I stubbed my toe.

A highlight was definitely the fresh smoothies and fresh waffles (different flavour choices). However, there are many other things available like cereals, muffins, pastries, omelettes, bacon, fruit and yogurts. The breakfast at Hampton inn is also one of the only in New York you get free. There was a lot more to offer then I was expecting! Throughout the day, the hotel has tea, coffee and ice water machines. There is also “chocolate milk” sachets with something that looks, and tastes, like hot chocolate. At mid-afternoon cookies are put on the reception desk warm and free to take. I would definitely recommend them! Finally, the hotel actually has its own viewing gallery on the roof/ top floor of the building. Unfortunately it was quite foggy when we went up but I’m sure it would look much better on a clearer night. Our room was perfectly sized and had a bath/shower in the bathroom included.

Only downsides were breakfast, it could get really busy. Plenty of options to choose from but you need to get down before 7 am / 7.30 am to enjoy as it gets way to busy after 8 am/8.30 am and you'd be lucky to find a table. There was often nowhere to sit and people would overspill to the lobby, the other thing that spoilt it a little was that plastic cutlery, paper plates and cups were supplied.....I think the hotel is better than this. The second downside was in our room - the toilet door (not sure if this was just our room though as we were based by the fire exit and it could have been to save space), it was a sliding door and didn't offer much privacy as there was a gap of about an inch around the door. No one mentioned where to find ice (which can be found on the 11th floor). This would have been useful information during check-in or when purchasing drinks from the lobby shop (which is only small but good enough). Deposit of a $100 was requested but there are no resort fees. Free wifi which is always great. Hairdryer supplied which was excellent for a hotel one, there's no need to bring your own.

The beds are doubles (rather than king) pushed to the side so access to both beds is through a narrow channel (the width of the bedside cabinet) between the two beds. We found this to be very close for 3 adults (although we are all family!) and it did impair our stay at this hotel.

Anyway, just so you are aware if you are regular sized adults, it's tight for sharing!!! We booked a Hampton as the breakfast is included - and it was breakfast and the breakfast service that we all enjoyed! Geraldine, the Irish breakfast manager, was amazing. And as much as she ran a tight ship in the restaurant (ie all foods were available, plentiful and the serving areas and tables were very clean and swiftly cleared), her natural warmth and enthusiasm for New York really helped us get the most from our stay.

We went everywhere from The MET to The statue of Liberty. Easy walking distance to Broadway shows, restaurants and subway.

Right across from the subway and so many places within walking distance. Walked to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave, Bryant Park, Central Park, Macy's, and so many restaurants. Room Location - Since I was bringing my family of 4 there for 5 day over Christmas, I did a lot of research on room location. I had called and asked several questions as well. So I was ready to pick my room the day before through online checkin. I picked a room and called to make sure it met my needs. After being told by 2 different workers that the layout of the ""03"" rooms is the best I felt great about my choice. I got a confirmation that we were checked in to this room. However, when we physically arrived, they had us in a different room. When I questioned the lady, she made up a lie and said that since we requested a refrigerator, we can't have that room because a refrigerator cannot go in that room. This seemed crazy since the lady that helped me pick that room said that it would be great for a refrigerator. After pressing this a bit she got a manager and he said that the person never checked out of that room, so we couldn't have it. Strange since it usually only lets you do online checkin after there person had checked out. I assume they just gave it to someone else and were making up excuses. This started our stay off on a bad note.We ended up in 2212 (which of course they assured was a superb room. It was facing 41st street, which is not what I wanted for street noise. The good news is that the street noise was not as bad as I expected. We are night-owls so the noise seemed to calm down when we were asleep. You could hear things, but we ran the fan on constant and used a white noise machine. Elevators - As noted on many reviews, you can wait 10-15 minutes at times. I would say either stay super low so you can use stairs, or super high. For getting a down elevator, the elevator always goes to the highest floor first and then stops at every floor requested on the way down. So the poor folks on floors lower than 20 got passed up all of the time because the elevator was always full. I felt really bad for those with full luggage carts who could not take the stairs. We only had issues a few times since we were usually leaving the building after busy checkout time. Breakfast - As noted on many reviews it is a zoo. It is a great perk that they offer this, but you need to have an incredible amount of patience to get your food. People are going in all directions and cut in front of you and bump you. The should re-design this room to have one long buffet bar going down he middle with access from both sides. The pinch points in the corners is awful. The last few days I just grabbed a ""To-Go"" bag and ate in my room. These bags are a great perk as well (small water bottle, apple, Nutri-grain bar, muffin). The staff that works this are great though. Always there to help. They will get you a banana if you ask for one!Lobby - Busiest lobby I have ever seen. It is small and so many people getting the free water/tea/coffee and waiting for rides or to check in.Front Desk - As mentioned above, we did not have a good checkin experience. Also, they assured us at check in that the refrigerator we requested for medical reasons was already in the room. It was not and never came. We had to call concierge to get it delivered. A few other times during our stay we asked the front desk for extra towels. They never came either, so we had to call concierge. Activities Planner/Helper - They have someone to answer questions and help with planning for a part of the day. They were very helpful! A nice perk!Rooms - Very clean and look to be recently updated. They are NYC small, but clean is so important and I have no complaints with that.","Overland Park, Kansas",9,4.0

It was a pretty hectic schedule with my wife wanting to look at the Christmas displays in all of the store windows but the one constant was the hotel. The room was clean and the staff was very nice throughout our stay. The front desk stored our bags until our room was ready and then stored them after we checked out (they gave us late checkout, too, so ask if you need it) until our shuttle arrived to go to the airport. The free breakfast was very popular and I have included photos of when it was busy and when I caught it during a lull on Thursday after many people had left for the parade (Served from 6:00 to 10:00 a..m.). I generally do not sleep well on my first night in a hotel but the bed was very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep both nights. Many hotels have pillows that are too thick but the Hampton Inn had 4 pillows on our bed - two were thicker than I prefer but the other two were just right! Kudos to them for providing two different sizes instead of taking the easy way out and just have one size fits all. In the shower, there was a nice touch for the ladies -- in the corner there is a bar about 10""-12"" off of the floor for you to rest your foot on while you shave your legs. I must also add that the ladies in the breakfast area were also very nice, working continuously to keep everything replenished. One also offered to take a photo of my wife and I when she saw us trying to get a good selfie! Eggs and meat are present every morning but may be different each day -- we had scrambled eggs one morning with sausage patties and the next it was cheese omelets and sliced link sausage. There are also juices, milk, cereal, various breads and rolls, two (2) toasters, smoothies, coffee, boiled eggs, and waffles! There is sure to be something for everyone. It is also convenient, only a short walk to the subway and several restaurants. The hotel also provides coffee and water in the lobby 24 hours a day, as well as 3 computers for your use and a fitness room. If you want a different view than you have from your room, one of the elevators goes to a viewing area on the roof, which I believe is the 32nd floor.

Called back down to ask about a new room. Very rude. Had to basically threaten to call the cc company to cancel the payment to get a new room. Breakfast was good but so over crowded you couldn’t get to much of anything and the dining room has so many tables packed in you can barely walk thru. We had originally planned to stay wed-sun but there is a winter storm coming in so we decided to check out on Saturday. We go down to the desk to tell them that on Friday and are being told we will be charged $150 anyway. I would NEVER recommend this hotel just because of crappy customer service.

What an impressive way to start the day and to make us feel that our business is valuable to them.We arrived in the early afternoon and were greeted warmly by none other than Lilly herself. She immediately got us in checked in, made suggestions for where we would like our room (we chose the 25th floor), and got a young man to Valet park our car. She could not have been more gracious and sets the standard by which you would like to be treated upon arriving at a hotel. Well done Lilly!Our room was spacious, very, very clean, and overall very comfortable. Our room had a city view which in itself was amazing. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and had a number of offerings including omelets, waffles,sausage, Danish, cereals, fruit and other assorted breakfast items. It was well stocked and plentiful. The breakfast room is larger than it looks when first entering and it too was ultra clean.Service staff and maintenance people were abundant and every single one of them greeted you in a friendly manner and always with a nice smile and kind words.I have seen other reviews where some people complained about the elevator service. I found the complaints to be completely unfounded as we never, not even once, had any issue with elevator service. We never waited more than a couple of minutes and once in, the elevator was fast. An added feature is that, elevators are not accessible unless you have your room key and swipe it. Once you swipe it, you can then select the floor that your room is located on.The hotel is convenient to everything in Times Square. We walked to Radio City Music Hall, about a 15 minute walk that seemed shorter and to Rock Center which is across the street from RCMH. Those were the longest walks we had. Great restaurants, theatres, and numerous bars for a cocktail are abundant within a 5 or 10 minute stroll, or shorter, from the hotel.Check out was smooth and efficient. The valet service does take a little bit of time as cars are parked at an off-site location.Overall, this was truly an exceptional experience.

The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and nicely updated, and there were no stains or signs of wear on the furniture and bedding. The employees stood out for their friendliness; every time a member of the maintenance department was on the elevator, they greeted the other passengers, and several times I witnessed the breakfast staff cheerfully helping fulfill an individual request in the midst of very crowded dining room. While I did not use the services of the concierge, it was good to know that this was an option. During my visit it was quite cold outside, but the complimentary coffee/tea/hot water station in the lobby was always amply stocked and free from litter.

I eventually got the front desk and someone arrived rather quickly.My bigger issue was with housekeeping. I was only staying for two nights and had my DND sign up and my room was still entered and cleaned. This might seem petty however in hospitality it is a simple and important rule to not enter and clean when service is not requested.One of the elevators was down intermittently which again has been an issue all 6 items I've stayed.

It is just a block or two off the craziness of Times Square with a subway stop right across the street from the hotel. It's a close walk to the Theaters and many restaurants. One of the best parts was having a breakfast included before starting our busy day. Yes the breakfast room does get busy as mentioned but we always found a seat and there is additional seating in the lobby if you make a plate and take it out there. Great variety at breakfast - if you don't like the hot options there was always much more - smoothies, bagels, fruit, muffins etc. One day we had to be at Good Morning America at 6:00 am and they had grab and go breakfast ready in a bag at the front desk and we grabbed a coffee and ate breakfast in line for GMA. Not buying breakfast or coffee saved us a lot in NYC! It was also nice that the hotel had water, coffee, tea etc available in the lobby 24/7 and cookies often as well. Everyone we encountered at Hampton was friendly and eager to help in any way needed. Good value for the money - we paid ~$350 per night but remember you are in the heart of Manhattan and breakfast included. We ended up getting Sunday night half price through a Hilton Honors promotion. On a side note - had dinner at the bar next door (Gleason's Tavern) one night when we were tired and food was great and enjoyed talking to bartender and a few locals.","Frisco, Texas",5,5.0

We stayed here for four nights during September 2019 in a two double bed room.Check in and out was fast and efficient. Room and bathroom size was good. Room amenities included tea/coffee facility, room safe and standard bathroom supplies. The entire hotel was very clean and housekeeping did a good job.The staff we came across was helpful and efficient. We organized our car to Newark airport through the hotel and the price was ok and service timely.We could not check out the rooftop view but view from the room was fine.There is a small shop at the lobby for soft drinks and similar items which was helpful for us. The hotel also provides free tea and coffee at the lobby.Considering what I have written so far it should have been five stars but I cannot give that due to problem with elevators and breakfast.As mentioned by others, there are only three elevators and it is not enough for a hotel of this size during the morning rush hours which starts around 8 am. We had to wait for nearly twenty minutes to get into the elevator one day. If you are going to the airport in the morning then make sue you have sufficient time in hand.The hotel provides breakfast which in included in the room rate. The food was ok but the size of the breakfast room is too small with insufficient seating arrangements. Unless you start your breakfast before 7 am getting a table is doubtful. In fact we had to skip the hotel breakfast one day as there were no place to sit and it was way beyond over crowded. Please note there is no other restaurant at the hotel.As a conclusion if you are looking for central location, decent price and a clean hotel and will not mind avoiding the morning rush and skip hotel breakfast then this is highly recommended.",Dubai,89,4.0

First, the housekeeping staff were very inconsistent during our eight night stay. Some days they left no coffee packets, other days they left all decaf, and one day they left coffee but no plastic insert to use the machine. The bottom sheet on the bed was too small for the mattress and kept coming undone at the corners of the bed. Also, we had to ask to have the sheets changed even though we were staying over a week. Second, the wait for the elevator was VERY long in the morning while breakfast was being served. Housekeeping (with supply carts) seemed to use the same elevators as the guests so that complicated the process. The final negative was the crowded breakfast area, lack of sufficient seating and the mediocre quality of the food. After a few days, we ate at places near the hotel.

We’ve stayed at that place before and know it’s in nowhere near as nicely kept.A couple of things you have to know, and this is probably a big city issue more than a problem with the hotel—you have to anticipate the crowd/time. Go to breakfast early. Our first morning, we had an early tour so we had the place pretty much to ourselves at 7. The next day at 10 was a different story!

So close to all of the times square attractions, the subway, and the bus terminal if you are arriving in on the Newark Airport Express bus from the EWR airport (just a half of a block walk from the bus terminal to the hotel). We arrived before check in, and the hotel desk stored our bags in a locked room so that we could explore the city until our room was ready. We chose a room on the second floor due to reading reviews about the hassle with the elevators. We are glad we made this choice. The convenience of taking the stairs (4 flights of stairs from the lobby to the second floor) during the breakfast rush made us very happy with our decision. We did not see any problems with elevator wait times at any other point during the day throughout our one week stay in June though. It is really just a concern at breakfast time. On the first day, we lucked out and found one dining table open to eat at during breakfast. The other days, it was so busy, that we just took our food back up to our room and ate there due to lack of seating. Take note of the sign that the hotel posts about breakfast busy times - we found it to be pretty accurate, so to avoid a wait, go early! The room was nice and clean. The beds were okay - not the most comfy, but not the worst. We were worried about street noise being on the second floor, but it was not a problem at all. There is the occasional siren that you hear, but other than that, noise was not that bad because 41st street was not a particularly noisy street. The only problem we had with the room was actually a pretty annoying problem. Mosquitoes! We kept finding mosquitoes in our room and I am highly allergic to mosquito bites - where the bites turn into welts, then bruises, then blisters - not fun. Well, we would kill the ones we would see, but I still would get bit. Then we would leave for the day and come back in the evening and find that the room had more mosquitoes! I don't know how they were getting in. We did notice that the windows to the outside opened slightly, so my guess is that housekeeping either opened the windows while they were cleaning each day which let in the mosquitoes, or they were traveling through the vents. Either way, I have never had a mosquito problem in a hotel room like I did here. No matter how many we would kill, there were more, and they kept biting me so that I would wake up with fresh bites each morning. I did mention the problem upon checkout, so hopefully they can address where the mosquito problem is coming from and treat it.

At first wasn't happy with room size, it was small, (city view king) and lack of some amenities - no mini fridge or microwave. Don't know if that's a code thing for NYC or not, unlike other Hamptons that offer them. Made our reservation directly, the woman on the phone was wonderful and so helpful. Upon arrival in late afternoon, valet didn't take long and helpful while we were putting things on cart to bring in. Yes it's a bit pricey per day for valet but much rather have my car to get there and go home. You don't take it out other than that. Had city view king size room with great view, especially first day, only day we actually saw any sun, can't blame hotel for weather. When I first saw room, wasn't thrilled. Far smaller than any Hampton Inn room I'd had, felt a bit old, purple carpet needs to go, purple black out drapes don't exactly black out, they'reabout 2 inches too short so the light comes streaming in morning time, night time not too bad but the city lights definitely act like a big night light thru the drapes.Hotel pics show a king size room as having a comfortable looking sitting chair but when we got up there, it was only a work desk and chair. Coming to NYC there's a lot of walking and I wanted a comfortable chair to relax in and was shown as part of the room. Went down to the front desk to ask where said chair was, young woman said she didn't know what rooms had those chairs (?) but a manager was right there and immediately said they would bring a chair up to our room. To their credit, chair arrived in 5 minutes delivered by a nice gentleman from housekeeping. We smooshed it in next to the end corner of the bed as the room wasn't that big. Like to see less workspace size and rigid work chair and more of a nice true comfortable sitting chair to relax and enjoy that view with at the end of the day, especially for the cost of the rooms...yes I know it's NYC, rooms are pricey but for pricey I want it comfy. Not much room to put clothes away, 3 small drawers attached to work space desk and a closet. Kept our things in our suitcases for 4 days, used closet to hang up a couple of things. Bathroom, was spacious enough, housekeeping would just give us more towels when we asked. Was disappointed to start putting things out on the counter and realized there was someone's hair right by the hotel soaps and it wasn't mine. Countertop didn't seem clean rest of bathroom did. Broke out some hand sanitizer and wiped down counter and got rid of hair. The duvet didn't have the usual card on it as other Hamptons that say it's basically fresh and clean, always a nice touch to see but not this go around so far as a note but appeared clean. Elevators, in our 4 days we never waited anytime I would even consider close to being long and we were in and out of the building frequently and close to a top floor. Elevator was quick once we got in and selected our floor. Roof top observation deck bit of a let down, expecting more like a patio type but guess that's not possible up on a 32nd floor and there wasn't really a lot of room up there, but it's worth taking a quick look around. Bed, comfortable, shower, always hot water, room, much smaller than I expected a king city view would be. Quiet except for heavy slam sound of neighboring doors. For so many people being there, we had quiet nights. Breakfast was busy but we got in, got our food and we did find seating each day. Waffles are always available and cereals, fruit, muffins, yogurt, juice, coffee, teas, bacon, sausage, etc. It would be nice to offer scrambled eggs every day and then an extra option like the western omelet or plain cheese omelet but that's just personal choice. But still a little hint to the Hampton Inn for breakfast offering. Geraldine works in the breakfast area, she is sweet, happy and hard working. Tea, coffee, cocoa, cold water, etc available all day by registration desk. All in all for a first time stay, we enjoyed it. Hotel staff polite and helpful.With volume of people coming to front desk it can get hectic, but it's a customer service job, for the most part all the staff seemed customer service oriented. Not sure of other Hamptons in area, may check them out but overall this was a good experience, wish room was a bit more comfortable in size but location was fantastic.","Boston, Massachusetts",8,4.0

Also the noise coming from outside is terrrible, some soundproofing would be much appreciated. I couldn’t sleep well because of this.Issue #2, the elevators take a lot of time and are most of the times full. I think 3 elevators for all the floors and rooms is not enough? All 5 days of my stay it took me between 5 to 15 minutes (the worst day) to go down to first level from 19th floor.Issue #3, on the last day of my stay I left 8 am my room and came back 4Pm, to see my room wasn’t cleaned up. This is unacceptable for so many hours they could have taken care of my room. An apology is not enough, I had to leave my room for a couple of hours to let the hotel to take care of this.Would probably stay back again, but only if the management takes care of these issues, if not I would not come back again.","Lima, Peru",36,3.0

I am a fairly faithful Hilton Honors Guest, so I most often make reservations on line. Shortly before we traveled, I wanted to ensure our rooms were in close proximity, and even, perhaps, adjoining. Although it is possible to do this “in a little box” online, I opted to call the hotel directly. I spoke to Olivia, who was at the Front Desk. I explained the situation and she explained the configurations and possibilities. At that time there was no availability, but Olivia assured me she would note the request and that they would make the appropriate accommodations should there be cancellations and changes. When we arrived, I merely gave my name and confirmation number. The clerk replied with a genuine smile, oh yes, Miss *** your rooms are ready, we were able to make the appropriate changes and you have adjoining rooms. I looked at her name tag, and it was Olivia. She took care of the situation, remembered our conversation, and greeted me in a warm and friendly manner. Throughout our stay she was most helpful, almost thinking one step ahead of our needs. Every hotel should have at least one Olivia. Although the hotel is fairly good size, it is set up in a way as to not be overwhelming. There is a comfortable well-lit lobby area, suited for gathering and snacks. Beverages are always available. I particularly liked that one must use a room key in order to access the buttons in the elevator. This is a good security feature.  The Hampton breakfast buffet was busy, but the staff kept right on top of things. The food was always fresh, and the associates were efficient at clearing tables keeping the area clean; and they did it all with smiles.  The rooms were very clean, and the housekeeping staff very friendly and helpful. They were discreet in not disturbing, yet efficient in offering supplies and doing daily cleaning. One in our party became ill. Olivia and the rest of the front desk team were most helpful in providing things we needed, telling us where the closet urgent care was located, and so forth. The manager allowed us to keep one room through the afternoon until we had to leave for the airport so the patient could rest comfortable. I put this in the category of going above and beyond. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone searching for a place to stay in the Times Square area. The property is wonderful, but the staff totally outstanding.","Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",24,5.0

I was really reluctant to stay in Times Square while traveling for work, but because of prices, this was my best option of Hilton properties/central location. This Hampton Inn is located right across from an entrance into the Times Square/42nd St. Subway, which was fantastic for me since I was traveling all over the city and needed a large selection of subway lines at my disposal. The complimentary breakfast had a large variety, great selection of coffee/creamers, but the downside was limited seating in the breakfast area for large crowds. The hallway outside the elevators on my floor was a little small and cramped, but my room was clean, beautiful bathroom, and well maintained. The front desk staff was excellent - they were knowledgable and efficient and did not judge when my dinner was a box of oreos and Haribo gummy bears. Times Square has limited non-cheesy dining options, so you'll feel a little limited there, but my stay was excellent for the hotel and the money.

The location is perfect, just around the corner from the theater (you can enter the Lyric on 42nd). We arrived from our other NYC hotel around noon and they allowed us to check in early which was fantastic. The people at the front desk are super helpful and polite. I heard lots of people asking really basic, almost silly questions to the staff and they were so nice in their replies. We had reservations for dinner at Tony's in between the shows and were able to come back to the hotel to relax before we had to go back to the second part of our show. There is free coffee, hot chocolate and tea in the lobby which is great. The front desk helped us reserve a private car to JFK (so easy - $75) and we ate the free breakfast buffet around 7 am. There were people there at that time but it was not crowded at all. The breakfast opens at 6 am. Rooms are fine, pretty standard but clean. Bed was comfy and it was quiet on our floor. We did see alot of teens in the hotel so I think large groups do come to stay and could get rowdy but we didn't see that. The elevators were readily available to us and we did not have to wait long. There is so much food nearby and the subway is just down the block. I was against staying in Times Square for our entire trip and stayed on E. 40th street for the rest of our stay but I do regret that now. This Hampton Inn would have been a perfect place for the entire stay, so convenient and with a good vibe.

Plenty of towels which was great.What was a let down was breakfast - too many people in a too small a space and I don't really expect to dine in a hotel with paper plates, paper cups and paper bowls with plastic cutlery. It was cheap and tacky and to be honest, the food was not brilliant and we chose to eat breakfast out after a couple of days. Apart from that, the hotel was fine as was its location.

I’d emailed beforehand to ask for a room with a shower rather than a bath on a higher floor and got exactly what I requested, the room was fantastic, spotlessly clean with the most comfortable beds that we did not want to get out of!

We stayed for 7 nights - the rooms must be soundproof because did not hear a thing from what felt like a full hotel! Slept really well despite the time differences from the UK and the fact we were right on times square - was a bit concerned at first it would be too loud but it wasn't. Being near times square also had it's advantages - we were very close to a Walgreen's for any essentials. The room has a good sized bed, spacious shower with a good sized sink and mirror. Very very clean. There is also a safety deposit box, tea/coffee, iron and a hairdryer, and a decent sized television. The lobby was great to see, the staff on the desk were pleasant and very helpful. There is a small shop next to reception desk, it's reasonably priced, it's mainly snacky things like ice creams, crisps, chocolate etc, there are small microwaveable pizzas but the microwave is for everyone, guess it's a good emergency option to have.The best bit by far was breakfast - especially seeing Geraldine every morning, she was very accommodating, lovely to chat to, always full of tips, always looked forward to telling her the next morning what we had done through the day before. I know my auntie is now booking to come back to this hotel, not only for the great experience we had but because she wants to see Geraldine again! Breakfast is very varied, my favourite and morning ritual being a waffle (with everything on top - whipped cream, chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce), fruit loop cereal - sometimes I'd throw a yoghurt, bananas, muffins within the mix - but there was a lot more - sausages, eggs, bagels etc. The area was kept very clean, heavily recommend going as close to 6am as possible as it does get quite hectic. Geraldine also gave us some lunch bags (which are also available form the desk) which included water, a muffin and a cereal bar, i'd also grab some bananas from the breakfast mix to take too. These were a life saver. We always have a good big breakfast so these snacks lasted us well until the evening for our next big meal. My only criticism of the hotel would be 3 elevators is a bit of a nightmare, they do get quite full and sometimes you have to wait a while - but as I was on holiday, was hardly in a rush and quite happy to stand around. Would definitely recommend, would go back tomorrow. Currently missing my morning waffle!","County Durham, United Kingdom",10,5.0

Too many restaurants to count. Lots of stores. I mean it's perfect for a tourist or a business person. Great also if you are a family with kids. Super safe neighborhood.-Breakfast: that is where they shine. Great service (that guy attending the breakfast room is very polite, helpful, attentive and kind). Great and diverse choice. It tastes really good. Honestly, they rock! Option offered if you are on the go (bag with fruit, water and bars). Enough said!- Free hot chocolate, tea, coffee etc all day long- Great and functional amenities (laundry room). - Front desk: most friendly people. So helpful and try to go above and beyond. Its been consistently my experience with them the many times I went there. You really feel welcome.Cons:- the rooms are small. But expected for a newer hotel in Manhattan.- the cleaning staff should be more careful with making sure the towels are spotless (hair and stains will always be gross, sorry).

We arrived early and got checked in quickly and were in a room on the 20th floor with a nice little snippet view of the times square lights. Our room was a good size (quite big for New York) and was light and clean. Breakfast the next morning was good, not a huge amount of choice but plenty of things to set you up for the day. We had waffles one days and found they really filled you up. Lots of bread, muffins and bagels for toasting with jams, cream cheese etc. It does get very busy after 8.30am but we were normally down for 7am so always got a place to sit. Obviously like many reviews before me I MUST mention Geraldine, this women is the glue that holds the Hampton together. She’s so chatty, happy and friendly and a pleasure to see every morning! The coffee station in reception was a fab little pick me up in the afternoons after a long day out exploring along with the fresh cookies. The lifts do get a little busy at peak times but we never waited for more than a few minutes. We used the concierge to book a shared shuttle van back to the airport which came to $42 for two of us which was a good deal and nice to know it was sorted.

John at the concierge was amazing! He even worked with my friend to send me a last minute birthday surprise effortlessly. The breakfast was packed to the brim full of choices, fresh baked cookies at 5pm, a 24 hour coffee/tea/hot chocolate bar.... Could you ask for more?

The beds here are comfortable and we found it to be very quiet. Make sure to go to the roof top to take in a great view. The location can not be beat; we were so close to everything.

Check in was great, we were given a room on the 30th floor out of 31.. this was great as I actually requested a city view, and what an amazing view of the Empire State lit up at night. The whole view was spectacular. Obviously being high up has its drawbacks, mainly being breakfast and waiting for the elevator. I had read time and time again regarding the queue which is why we went down around 7am each morning. If you go between 6 and 7.30 it will probably come straight up to you. One morning we went early, back to the room to collect stuff and went out to explore the city around 9am. It took nearly 10 minutes from waiting for the lift, to then stopping at floor after floor to the bottom. We were like sardines by the ground floor. On the first night I thought I would attempt the stairs to the bottom. It was ok going down but back up was exhausting.. 417 steps each way!! Staff really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I was told by another guest at breakfast you can go up to the roof top after the 31st floor and we done that on the last day. A lovely balcony with great views. This was a great hotel and offered everything you need.. A safe in room, lovely big bed, great views.. My critisms were the shower was poor, hardly any pressure. The sliding bathroom door was so impersonal. Not a great design which don’t give much privacy when going toilet. And lastly we had the most annoying extractor fan in the bathroom which didn’t seem to turn off, so if you woke at night you struggled to go back to sleep.

Just a minutes walk to the subway and Times Square. 5th Avenue 5 minute walk and very well placed to get around. Our room was on the 7th floor with 2 comfy beds, clean bathroom with lovely white fluffy towels, and plenty of room to get around. The breakfast was plentiful with fresh fruit/yogurts/porridge/cereals/Boiled eggs/scrambled eggs/ bacon or sausages on alternate days/ bread/bagels/muffins/ and Waffle maker (for you to make your own!!) with all different sauces and syrups. We never had a problem finding a table. BUT the highlight of breakfast was definitely Geraldine the restaurant supervisor what an ASSET to the hotel she is, always friendly, informative and so helpful ( one morning I lost my voice, she was soon at my side with a lemon cut up in a bowl, so I could have a Hot lemon drink) Also John on the concierge desk was very helpful. The only downside to the Hotel is the elevators one was out of action while we were there, and being in the 7th floor was very difficult to get it to stop, always going past, and if did stop was usually packed. Had to use the stairs quite a lot. Saying that I wouldn’t let that stop me from using the hotel again or from recommending it to others.

The room is of pretty good size by NYC standards and had everything required for a good night's stay including a very nice shower. The bed is comfy and the heating/cooling is very easy to control. The breakfast is excellent but would advise go early. The only downside was that all the ""crockery"" and cutlery was plastic/cardboard. It was all clearly marked recyclable, but if you wash up there's nothing to recycle. I realise this is part of keeping costs down but at what price to the planet? The lobby area is very pleasant with 24 hour free tea and coffee, a shop for confectionery, crisps, beer, forgotten items etc and an internet access area. Excellent.

We got checked in and when the elevator door opened we saw the door to our room just opposite in a narrow hall. Tired and cranky, our reaction to the room was ""why did we book this hotel?"" After a night's sleep we saw that the room was actually nice and very spacious for Manhattan and we realized that we heard no noise from the elevator, hall or nearby rooms. The location is fantastic. The subway is virtually across the street. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, shopping, theaters. The room was very clean with lots of towels, storage, comfortable beds. Breakfast got crowded at times, but the food variety was decent and there was a lot of staff. They offered carry out boxes when they saw that I was trying to carry food up to the room.

We took the buffet breakfast option and have to say we were really glad we did, there are all the breakfast foods anyone could wish for, we mastered the art of the waffle maker by the second day (became such old hands at it we were demonstrating how it worked to the newbies), but there are fruits, hot items, yogurts, cerial etc....something for everyone. Also the breakfast supervisor Geraldine was a joy to talk to first thing in the morning, always humerous, pleasant, positive and full of useful info about the best way to get somewhere, the best places to shop, basically a mine of information happy to answer all our questions, which we really appreciated. Geraldine also kept the dining room ticking over with no problem, she would clean and clear your table without you noticing she'd even been there! The housekeping staff were great, the room was cleaned daily and to a high standard. Also need to mention Louis (concierge), what a asset to the hotel! Louis is one of those guys that knows all the inside/local knowledge and can furnish you with directions to anywhere, get you a taxi, and ensure you have a wee bag of supplies for the airport (water, sweets, nuts...).

Because we were first timers, we didn't realize we needed to book a shuttle to return to the airport 24 hours in advance, but John, the Consierge, was able to find just what we needed in a couple of hours on a very busy day. A real advantage to staying here is that when you check out, they will let you check your bags with the bell boy to be kept in their secured storage area for up to 24 hours without charge.

Not the elevators, other hotel guests or the noise of NYC!! What a wonderful change from my first stay in NYC at a boutique hotel.

The things deserve two starts are the location and that it's clean.I'll start with value for money we paid $307 per night booked a month ago on the hotel's site. When we arrived at the hotel we found out we paid 80% more than current rates (also directly to the hotel's site). With a cold laconic correspondence with Hilton that got us very annoyed at the very beginning of our stay.When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was very kind and on a by the way suggested we will have breakfast early because the lifts might be busy between 6am and 10am... Little did we know...For a hotel with 25 floors and so many rooms you would expect the horel to provide suitable dining area and lifts. Hampton Inn forgot to do that. Or simply doesn't care.There are 3 lifts for the whole building. Stopping at every floor. We found ourselves cramped well beyond maximum weigh for the lift with people saying they have been waiting for the lift for 30 minutes. Worse than the subway!When we arrived at the fameus breakfast finally, it is nothing special or interesting it just not enough. Not enough food to feed the number of people at the dining area and not not enough room to sit. It was so crowded and loud and as result dirty as well.The cherry on the top is the use of paper plates and plastic tableware. Bad for the environment and basically disrespectful. I would expect a hotel proud of its Hilton heritage to have higher standards in service and operation. ",,22,2.0

The staff was super helpful, professional and friendly, they also checked me in early, gave me bottled water for the trip to the airport. I really loved the breakfast options, I went between 7 and 8 am and there were still plenty. Each day there would be an egg option, sausages/patties, fresh fruits, oats with dried fruits etc, yogurts, bagels with butter, cream cheese and honey and packed jams, morning pastries, tea and coffee, there even was a batter to make your own pancakes with fruits and whipped cream. It was very convenient and saved me some money on breakfast. There are some very good tee/coffee options 24/7 in the lobby too. The The building is 31 fl high, so even though I had the top floor, I couldn't see much of Manhattan, but at least it wasn't looking at a wall or someone's window.I loved the room - the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Plenty of power sockets next to the bed and desk. Because of the high floor, I couldn't hear the traffic.

We reserved our room online using the Hilton HHonors website, and we remitted Hilton points for a complimentary stay. Although we were offered the option to check in online the day prior to our stay, we declined.The Hampton Inn Times Square Central opened in June 2015 on West 41st Street (between 7th and 8th Avenues) in Midtown, just one block from the Port Authority bus terminal (which also offers vehicle parking and subway stops). This property is centrally located to many tourist areas such as Times Square, Broadway theaters, shops and restaurants, and Bryant Park. It is a few blocks walk to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, and Macy’s Herald Square.The hotel offers a 32nd floor rooftop observation deck, complimentary buffet breakfast (or alternately, a grab-and-go weekday breakfast bag), fitness center, private meeting space for 12 people, and a pantry shop (where you can purchase drinks, snacks, forgotten items, and souvenirs). Local artwork and photographs decorate the public spaces. This newer hotel features what Hampton Inn calls its “Perfect Mix Lobby”, which has seating and lighting options for both business and vacation travelers. The Hampton Inn Times Square Central offers 300 rooms in several categories: King, Two Doubles, King City View, or Two Doubles City View. Room amenities include complimentary Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs, coffee makers, safes (that fit a laptop), irons/ironing boards, and clock radios. Bathrooms include oversize walk-in showers (most do not have a traditional bathtub/shower combination), hairdryers, and toiletries (soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion). Although we booked a king room, when we checked in early, only double-bedded rooms were available, so we accepted one. Our room was cozy, with a closed/desk/TV unit located opposite the beds, and a bathroom with a sliding door next to one of them. The bathroom itself was a good size, larger than some we have seen in the city. Although our room was located directly across from the elevator bank (with three elevators), it was quiet and we did not hear any hallway noise. But it was on the smaller size, the beds were doubles instead of queens, and the odd location of the bathroom door was bothersome and did not provide maximum privacy. (Positioned at the middle of the floor near the elevators, we think that our room was a bit smaller than some others and also that our bathroom door was in an alternate location than in other rooms, but we cannot say for sure.)Our stay at the Hampton Inn Time Square Central was acceptable, but we prefer alternate Hilton-branded locations in the same area for similar cost.",Pennsylvania,919,3.0

I joked to my wife that I was lucky not to have gotten an elbow in my ribcage. It was so crowded that I was ready to go to the nearby McDonalds for breakfast. The hotel has posted a list of times when the breakfast area is the busiest. Clearly more needs to be done.-The hotel advertises a rooftop deck, however it is small, there is no place to sit down there and the view is not that good. -Even though its near Times square, you will not get a Times Square view from the rooms.-The rooms need a refrigerator. There wasn't one in our room.-The lobby is small and seemed crowded.If you are not that concerned about the view, or getting an elbow in your ribcage at the breakfast, this may the hotel for you.

First let me say the rooms are very nice as is the lobby. Service was great and very friendly. Breakfast offering was pretty good. Location is great if you want Times Square/Central. Now for the downsides and reason for only 3 stars, some of which the hotel cannot change. #1: there are only 3 elevators servicing 30 floors so average elevator transport time was 7 minutes each way. During ""off times"" (ie middle of the day) you might only wait 3-5. The elevator waits are EXTREMELY annoying. I suggest you request a lower floor and use the stairs. #2 construction noise: We were awakened 3 of the 4 mornings by VERY loud construction adjacent to the hotel. We had ""white noise"" makers on to help with sleep, but it made no difference. It was a heavy pounding and it looks like construction just started. #3:. Breakfast chaos: while the food offering and area is nice (and staff very helpful), when you have ~ 300 rooms trying to eat around the same time in that small an area, it is very chaotic and hectic. You either get lucky and get a spot to sit, or need to take it back to the room (see #1 above). Breakfast was a stressful, unpleasant experience. The two closest ice machines to us on 22nd and 27th floors were both broken....I expect more from a $350/night hotel. Due to all this, I could not recommend this hotel as nice as the staff was.","Austin, Texas",49,3.0

Customer service & hospitality were the best I’ve ever experienced - at any hotel! We received a text before check in welcoming us and offering help if we needed it. We replied asking if we could bring our bags before check in and they were happy to help! (We did so at checkout too!) We also tried purchasing from their kiosk and instead they recommended the store around the corner to save us money - you could tell the customer and not the bottom line came first! Ever staff member was welcoming, hospitable and wore a smile. You can tell they are true professionals! I love that Hampton Inn includes hot breakfast - the selection is wonderful, even if the buffet line and dining room are rather crowded at this location. The elevators, likewise, can be crowded and run slow during peak times. We received a pro tip from the front desk to take a lower level room and were glad we did! It wouldn’t work for everyone, but we loved taking the stairs to save time. A picky person might have complained that the room was small and had a big dip in the floor, but honestly it was super clean, comfortable, and in the heart of NYC! We didn’t mind. The location was a huge plus - it was central to most of our plans and we frequently chose to walk instead of taking the subway or a car just because everything felt so close! It was easy to pop in and out of the hotel between events (think changing for dinner, or dropping off souvenirs) because of the location.

It's only a couple blocks south of Times Square and it was also centrally located to many of the other top tourist attractions. It was also clean and the beds were relatively comfortable. Those are the only good things about this hotel, the rest was unpleasant. We stayed a total of 3 nights...2 of the 3 nights had false fire alarms go off in the middle of the night. Luckily they turned them off before we made it downstairs, but they still went off long enough for us to decide to get up and start getting dressed - I was disappointed that no one from the hotel even apologized for the disruption or inconvenience. After each fire alarm, there began a LOUD vacuum-type noise outside of our room for a long time - must have been some kind of ventilation system, so again we had another disruption. Also on our last night, our AC unit started rattling like crazy during the night, so between that and the alarm, it was not restful. Additionally, I would NOT recommend staying here if you are staying with someone you aren't 100% comfortable with. The bathroom doors were barn-door style, with HUGE gaps on either side of the door. You could hear EVERYTHING - honestly the door could have just not been there and it wouldn't have made a difference. Furthermore, there were 30 floors and only 3 elevators.

It is so easy to get around everywhere. The hotel has a very welcoming lobby and every person that worked there that I spoke with was nothing but nice and helpful. I thought the rooms were really nice too. The breakfast in the morning was plentiful and although it could be a little crowded, there was never that long of a wait to get to what you wanted to. That being said we had three issues with the housekeeping. It was our only area of concern. The first one - my husband left about 3 spoonfuls of yogurt in a container in the room to be thrown away. He didn't want to place it in the garbage can because there was no liner. When we got back to the room after a long day of visiting NYC I sat on the bed and saw a strange sight on the wall next to the bed. There were splatters of the yogurt all over the wall and the picture on the wall too. We went down to tell the front desk - and we were on the way out again - and they sent someone up to clean it. Well, we come back at night - starting to get ready for bed and I find yogurt on my nightshirt! And of course, it was the only one I brought and it was late at night - well you get the picture. I wasn't too happy and was wondering where else the yogurt could have gone. The second occurrence was when my husband came to the room in the afternoon to do some work the next day and the room wasn't made up. He requested that they make up the room and went downstairs to work. An hour and a half later it still wasn't done. The third thing was on our last night. When we got back to the room, the room was cleaned but the cleaning person left their black vinyl cleaning gloves on the dresser. Soooo - if it wasn't for these blunders I would have given this hotel a much higher rating. Also, the elevators are slow so if you are an impatient person you should get a room on a lower floor.","Long Grove, Illinois",2,4.0

The views are amazing and location is spot-on-perfect. Bed is very comfortable, shower and bathroom were great. Just an overall great experience.If I had one minor gripe - their elevators take forever. Well, let me explain. If it's late at night and it's just you...the elevators are quick. But if it's morning and you're on the top floor, it takes a good 10 minutes to get down because you're stopping on every floor. Then the people on the lower floors can't get in because they are packed. I advise the hotel to have one elevator devoted to the top half, one to the bottom half and one serving all floors. This will really help.Otherwise, an awesome stay! For the price and what you get, it's the best deal in NYC in my opinion. Will definitely stay here again.","Oakland, California",2,5.0

The location is good, in the heart of the theater district and Times Square (this is good for theater going, but bad for food). Subway is a half block away. The check-in experience was great. Irish lady checked us in and was super friendly, giving us an option of rooms and stuffing our goodie bag (Hilton Gold members). Wifi is fast enough for Facetime, but did glitch a few times. Room itself was a good size for NYC and looked like it was remodeled recently. Beds were comfortable, although the bedding seemed a bit old (i.e., not a down comforter). Pillows were very soft and lumpy. Flat screen TV with a plethora of channels. USB and plugs right next to the beds (thank goodness!!).Bathroom was small. Shower/tub combination. Water pressure wasn't great and the hot water needed to be at 100% to really be hot. Amenities include shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, lotion, and body wash. Ask for extras though as the bottles are super tiny and the housekeepers didn't replenish.There are only three elevators for approximately 275 rooms. In the morning there are quite long wait times for the elevators. Breakfast was included and it was a zoo. Hard to find seating, floors are sticky, kids are making a mess everywhere (there are waffle machines....need I say more?).

The location was perfect, there is a subway stop close by and it is one block from the chaos of Times Square. The room was very spacious and clean. There was an iron and a safe in the room and they came in handy. I also appreciated that there was NYC inspired artwork and photography throughout the premises. We had a room right next to the elevator and noise was never a problem. Our room was on the 19th floor, so we expected that the elevator would be busy in the morning. However, since we were up on a higher floor, the elevator was never full when it reached our floor. It was slow going down though because we were so high up. It was not that big of a deal because we were never in much of a hurry. The breakfast area was always busy during the mornings we were there, but we never had a problem finding a place to sit. There is a large variety of options for breakfast (i.e. waffles, eggs, meat, pastries, fruit, yogurt) and all of the food was good. On the morning we had to go to the airport, since it was before breakfast started at 6am, the hotel offered to-go breakfasts free of charge, which was nice. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, all of our interactions with a staff member were positive. The concierge was also helpful. There was coffee, ice water, and cookies in the lobby as well.

Complaints of others are really unfounded as it is the same anywhere at peak times. Same goes for the elevators. Avoid peak times. Don’t expect to run down and right back up or vice verse.

Often times when one did stop it was already jam packed. But after you wait 10 minutes you decide you, too, will cram yourself into the next one like a sardine. At off peak times this was not so much of an issue. One night I decided to go get ice two floors down. That was a 30 minute misadventure that included the machine in the process of making ice.

Although small, the lobby was outfitted with many areas to connect to the Internet to get some work done or just recharge. The rooms were small when traveling with more than one person. There was barely enough room in the bathrooms for toiletries for one person. There wasn't enough room for a chair, so you had to sit on the beds or an uncomfortable office chair, which was a little hard on the back. The complimentary wi-fi was very sketchy. In the mornings, it was pretty much non-existent. The 3 elevators were horrible for 30 floors. After pressing the button, they frequently skipped you as they went up and down.

When selecting the hotel, I initially chose it because of it proximity to Times Square, It is literally 2 blocks away. When researching I read reviews and most were very positive. We drove into the city from Boston and while this was my first experience driving in New York City, the hotel was pretty easy to navigate to. Upon check in, we were met by Luis, one of the Hotel's staff. He took care of our car and gave us a lot of helpful information on where to go and how to get around. We mentioned it was our 30th anniversary and to our surprise after returning from a days adventure, there was a bottle of wine, some goodies and a card signed by the staff members. This really made our day. The hotel was very clean and the lobby was always alive with people. The concierge helped us with show information. We were able to walk from the hotel to Times Square, the Empire State Building, Central Park. The only time we needed transportation was to Battery Park and One World and again the hotel was located a block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal where we could catch the train to One World. Our room on the 29th floor while small was very well laid out which can't be said of other hotels we stayed at during this trip. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was provided and we enjoyed it everyday. Each day the hot items were a little different but they always had the waffles. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip to NYC and say hi to Luis. Thanks Hampton!",,3,5.0

First, the staff. They were wonderful--friendly and helpful--including at the desk, in the breakfast room and the room attendants. The breakfast included in the room rate was very good and served until 10:00 am, which was nice for late night lifers. Every morning there were different offerings and the selection was quite wide. My only complaint was that sometimes there were not enough tables to seat all who were queued up, but with patience, even this problem resolved fairly quickly. That's the good, and nothing really bad, BUT be prepared for very small rooms. Ours just contained a king bed, a console with a desk and bureau, a desk chair and a padded stool. We were there with our family, and my daughter's room was somewhat larger with a small fridge and second seating bench. Still nothing to write home about regarding space. Like most hotels there was only one luggage rack. I will never understand why hotels don't provide two racks for a ""double"" room. Finally, the hotel is quite close to Times Square, but far enough away to avoid the dreadful press of humanity, and close to many of the theaters which for us was great because we were doing a theater orgy! We used points to get the room and I note on the TripAdvisor website the rate is $359 without tax.

The area where the free breakfast was served was crowded when I went down on Friday, but the food was hot and very tasty, which was the most important thing.

I suggest taking advantage of valet parking - it's worth the price.

Not amazing -but comfortable.Bath - it was probably renovated not so long ago - but water pressure is low and it takes to much time for the hot water to come - at least in the upper floors. And last but not least- the breakfast- absolutely awful. Very little healthy options, no greens, very little fruits. The dining room is packed so people actually take their breakfast (paper plates..) to the hotel lobby. I decided to step outside to a cafe and by myself a descent breakfast. I also want to mention the elevator issue: there are 3 elevators in the hotel - and the algorithm for those is terrible so as a resident in the high floors you would be stopped in at least 6-7 floors before getting to the lobby. People are waiting so much time for the elevator they wouldn't miss the one that came for the world- so they get in. No meter what. By the time you get to the lobby - the elevator is packed that badly that you need a breath of fresh air before thinking about anything else. There's also a road work in the street currently (may 2018) so ask for a room in the higher floors and to the opposite direction from the 41st. street.One advantage to finish nicely: location is great if you are into the whole times square vibe. A 2 minute walk to the subway and Broadway.and also- front desk service is good - I got an awful room at the 4th floor and asked to move to a different room. I was moved the same afternoon to a higher floor with a descent view. Good luck :)","Ramat Gan, Israel",14,2.0

For this reason, I requested a lower floor so that I could use the stairs to go to and from the room. I'm glad that I did. What I was disappointed with this visit was the housekeeping. We were there for four nights, and left the room very early each morning, and were out and about for the majority of the day. Despite this, we had to request housekeeping service late in the afternoon (3-4 ish) the first couple of days so that we could take showers and clean up before going out in the evening.

For ease, I have divided my review into sections.LocationThe location for NYC could not be better. It is a two minute walk from the hotel to Times Square, Broadway and a subway station. The hotel itself is on a 'quieter' (for NYC!) street but minutes in either direction offer a host of restaurants and places to buy snacks, as well as the key attractions such as theatres. I found that I could walk to many of the key sites from the hotel without any problems.Hotel facilitiesCheck in was quick, easy and friendly and staff were always on hand to help with questions or concerns. The lobby area is spacious with seating which is useful if waiting for taxis etc. There is also water and hot drinks available here which is a nice touch.The hotel is large with 31 floors and is serviced by three elevators. These were honestly the most irritating part of the stay - they seemed to have a mind of their own when it came to stopping for you when called, they were constantly packed at busy times and the keycard swipe system to select your floor was irritating. My advice would be to ask for a low floor and take the stairs at peak times!The roomMy room was large enough for me and easily big enough for two people. The bed was huge, very comfortable and the pillows were some of the most comfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel. A spacious wardrobe and drawers meant plenty of room for all my stuff. The bathroom was also large with a shower. The room had all the basics - toiletries, air conditioning and a coffee machine. My only complaint was while the coffee machine was great, powdered creamer was provided which wasn't to my taste.BreakfastBreakfast was provided during my stay. I chose this option because while I knew NYC offered hundreds of breakfast options I knew it would be good for me to be able to grab something before heading out for the day. The breakfast options were varied, offering cereal, pastries, yogurt and fruit as well as a few limited hot options including mini omelettes and 'make your own' waffles. I had breakfast several times during my stay and found the food options varied and of a good quality. I would recommend every Brit try Fruit Loops if you have never done so before! However... The area for breakfast was relatively small compared to the size of the hotel and it was often incredibly busy so there was nowhere to sit. This was frustrating at times. Also, all of the plates and cutlery was disposable paper and plastic which I felt was a complete waste and not very eco-friendly, as well as being irritating when on one occasion my plastic cup leaked everywhere!Value for moneyWhen looking at hotels for NYC, I noticed some included the city tax whereas some charged this as an additional extra on arrival. I chose Hampton Inn because it was an all included price. I think for the standard of the room and the superb location it was definitely good value for money.","Norwich, United Kingdom",49,4.0

The staff was wonderful and made our experience better than expected. We were a family of 4 that only reserved one room. That was a mistake. The rooms at The Hampton Inn are very small. Bathroom has 1 small sink and a shower The rooms only had 2 double beds which I was aware of, but no sitting area for tv and barely any clothes storage space. When we were tired of going sight seeing and walking Times Square the only place we could sit and relax was up in our room on our beds to watch Tv. . Most of the rooms were right next to the elevators. They had a decent free breakfast. Sometimes it got very crowded but that is to be expected. Again the staff was very helpful. Put us in a bigger room than we started out with but it was still really too small for 4 people.The staff did what they could with what they had. I think it is a good hotel to stay in for a quick stop for a couple of days but next time I think I will book a hotel that is more resort like, that has a restaurant and a lobby to kick back in . I picked the Hampton for a better price which included breakfast but we could've stayed in a more comfortable place without breakfast included for just a little more money.

I was very nervous and honestly a little (okay, a LOT) intimidated by New Yorkers. I was expecting rude people and judgement. I couldn't have been more wrong!! Our first contact was with a very nice man, Luis, that helped us out of our cab and even took our bags in for us. Then we went to the check in desk and the man checking us in was probably the NICEST person I have ever met! His name was Kris, and he was absolutely wonderful. We told him we were seeing Aladdin, and he gave us a tip that if you walk straight through the McDonald's across the street, the theater is right next door. That's another thing, this hotel is in the PERFECT location. It's right in the heart of Times Square without being on a main street, and it's about a 2 minute (if that) walk from the hotel to the New Amsterdam theater and Madame Tussaud's. And believe me, I am not a fast walker. When we checked out, we tentatively asked if they could hold our bags after we did so we could go to Madame Tussaud's, and they were more than happy to do it! When we left, Luis carried our bags out and even waved down a cab for us while dancing in the street to Michael Bublé (He's a great dancer). I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The elevators can get crowded quickly during busy times, but if you're patient enough you'll get one that isn't. The breakfast was a little disappointing, but all in all this hotel was great.

Bed was comftable (didn’t wake up one)Breakfast was great, love how you can make your own Waffles which led me to discover how great I am at making them :-)But the one of the main reasons I like the hotel is he fact that they can watch your bags while you explore the city even AFTER you check out!!! We took full advantage. After eating breakfast at 9am we went shopping and came back at 11am, checked out and told valet to get our car since you should request it 30-45 min before leaving. And we went to grab a quick bite and some gifts for the kids.We came back 45 min later and our car was ready to go and once we came back to the hotel found out that our bags were already in the car!! I will write that again... OUR bags were already on the car.. ready to go!!! Seriously how convenient... I didn’t get the gentleman’s name.

I usually stay at a Hilton family property but also have a few boutique hotels I love. This was my first stay at this Hampton Inn and it is by far my best and most pleasant stay in the city ever. I arrived at 7:30am prepared to leave my bags with the bellman but Kris at registration was able to get me in to a room right away. He was so friendly and welcoming so after my 3am wake up call for the flight in to NYC, I was grateful for the smiles and the room being ready. Besides the great welcome, what I noticed immediately was the feel in the lobby. It is bright, open, and arranged in such a way that it did not have that crowded NYC lobby feel. The breakfast room did get crowded but it was easy enough to move out in to the lobby where I always saw empty seats. The second thing I was over joyed with was the speed of the elevators. I was on the 23rd floor and I never had to wait long. By the way, on my first entry to the elevator, a very helpful employee, Tobo, was quick to hold the door open and explain the process of using the card. (I think it was Tobo, may have been Jonny, either way - at various times they were BOTH incredibly helpful.) Okay, on to the room. The hallway from elevator to room was wide, bright, and clean. The room was big by NY standards and the view of the city amazing. The bathroom likewise was big and laid out in a very user friendly way. The shower was the largest I have ever had in the city and the water pressure amazing. (I was a little sad when I returned home missing that strong spray.) There was always plenty of hot water too, which can sometimes be an issue in a large hotel. I read other reviews about the outlet not being near the desk... in my room it was true that the outlet was on the wall to the left and not right under the desk but my power cord reached it with room to spare. No problem there at all. The bed was comfy of course, it's a Hilton. Plenty of hangers in the closet, all the other amenities I need in a room were there. The location for me was perfect; a five block walk to my work and just a little farther to my favorite restaurants. It was heavenly to leave and return to this hotel each day without being jostled by hoards of tourists and be so warmly received. As long as the price stays within my budget, this will be my go to hotel for all of my stays. Thank you, Kris, Tobo, Jonny, and Rachelle!","Raleigh, North Carolina",164,5.0

Prices were very high (mid $300s, as I recall) for the night we needed, so I traded in a bunch of credit card points for a free night here. The location was just about perfect. It was a quick walk up from Penn Station, just 8 short blocks, and the hotel signage was easy to spot from all the way down at 8th Avenue (the hotel is about 200 ft off 7th Ave.).We were warmly welcomed and expertly checked in by the thoroughly professional Rachelle. That check-in experience is so important in establishing trust in the hospitality experience, and she aced it! Even though it's a big-city hotel, the lobby space felt reachable and knowable: there was a business center behind and to the left of the front desk, a 24-hr coffee/tea station just in front and to the left of the front desk, a sitting area with comfortable couches and a big TV screen opposite the front desk, a booking agent just to the left of that (for tours and Broadway tickets), and to the right, a large table with plenty of seats and power ports for laptop and tablet users. The breakfast area was set off just to the left beyond the elevators. I mean, it was all right there, making even a one-night stay easily navigable and very comfortable.The hotel was filled with all kinds of folks: families, both domestic and international; business travelers, both solo and in groups; lots of 20- and 30-somethings on city breaks; and retirees like us just doing their thing. And language galore! People everywhere seemed to be in a good mood, which I think says a lot about the hotel.The room was comfortable. It was one of the recent remodels among Hampton Inns, with the large, sliding door to the bathroom, with entry directly from the bedroom rather than the entry hallway. Everything was fresh and clean, with bathroom and coffee station supplies fully stocked and everything in perfect working order. Beds and bedding comfortable.Breakfast was equally well run, and fully stocked with just about every option in the Hampton Inn ""menu."" There is a sign in the lobby alerting guests to the typical quiet and busy hours in the breakfast room, which is great for setting expectations and allowing guests to plan accordingly--much better than the surprise about crowds when you're in a rush, and another sign that management is keyed in to customer satisfaction.That's enough.

After the cruise we stayed at this hotel for three nights ( it became 4 nights because of the nor'easter and we couldn't fly out as scheduled). The location was great, very close to Times Square and many other major sites. The hotel room had a king bed and a good size bathroom and it appeared that the room had recently been renovated. The breakfast was offered every morning from 6am till 10am. The breakfast room was very larger, and we never had a problem finding a seat. The selection was very good, from juices, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, fresh fruit (3), waffles that you made yourself, muffins, mini danish, donuts, yogurt, and every day a different egg selection and meat selection. Coffee, tea, hot chocolate were offered 24 hours, and in the early evening they offered fresh baked cookies. The staff was very helpful and friendly in every way possible. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that when we couldn't fly home on Wednesday, and we had to stay the extra night our room rate went way up and with the various taxes our room cost $360.00 US,but we were told that if it had been the following night the rate would only have been $120.00 plus tax. Not much we could do but we weren't all that happy. If we ever go back in the nicer weather we would certainly stay at this hotel.

Our bedroom on 15th floor was of an adaquet size with a decent sized shower room too. It was comfortable, clean and tidy but we felt that the bed covers were a little too shabby! The room was cleaned daily and re-stocked with toiletries. The buffet breakfast was suitable with plenty of choice of hot & cold food, including juices,fresh fruit, yogurts, cereals, waffles, eggs (scrambled, boiled & omlettes), Turkey sausages, bread, muffins and pastries.

A special mention goes to Louis who looked after us and organised our departure.

Two issues detracted from an otherwise pleasant stay. Firstly, we had no room service on the first day there.

The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of offerings and staff who worked in the dining room were quite pleasant.The bedroom and bathroom were good sizes (not tiny like a lot of hotels in the mid town area)My only quip about this hotel was the wait time for the elevators, which other guests had also mentioned. There are 3 elevators but they don’t seem adequate to handle the amount of guests that the facility caters, to particularly at busy times (e.g. towards the end of the time allocated for the breakfast buffet).

Our room was clean and spacious with a very comfy bed, adequate wardrobe/drawer space and a coffee maker. The bathroom was excellent with a large walk in shower and plenty of shelf space for toiletries. We were on the 16th floor at the front of the hotel, there was quite a lot of noise in the early hours on a couple of days from a loading bay opposite, but it is the very centre of New York so we didn't expect peace and quiet or super posh triple glazed windows that you might find in a more expensive hotel. The staff here were all friendly and helpful. A buffet breakfast is included, there is a reasonable choice of food with a couple of hot dishes, fresh fruit, yogurt, waffles and pastries plus juice, tea and coffee. There are paper plates and plastic cutlery and a large bin by the door to encourage you to clear your own table, but there were also staff around to do this and wipe tables. Yes it was hectic but we always found a table, if you go before 8.00am it's a lot quieter. There is coffee, tea and hot water available in reception which was very welcome coming in from the cold.The lifts were busy, but we never had to wait for more than a few minutes for one.Overall we were delighted with this hotel, it exceeded our expectations. One word of warning though, on departure reception offered us a private transfer to JFK for 65 dollars which we accepted. It was very comfortable with a pleasant driver, but on arrival at the airport we were told it was 75 dollars and she didn't have any change.

We wanted a hotel that would be close to the theater district for the three days that we were in town for a girls trip. But would make this even more attractive was the subway stop which is just down the block and the port Authority bus terminal. By far the easiest way to get from your hotel to JFK is to walk maybe a quarter of a mile to the port Authority bus terminal you can actually see it from the hotel. Hop on an NYC AirPorter it’ll take you direct to either LaGuardia or JFK airport. And it will drop you off your specific terminals.

This made it easy for us to take the NYC Airporter bus shuttle from JFK and just walk to the hotel.The nice location of this hotel was surpassed, however, by the friendliness of the hotel staff. The front desk, the cleaning staff, the staff in the breakfast area and the concierge were all engaging and helpful. Be sure to talk to John , the concierge, if you really want to hear an authentic NY accent. He was very funny and very knowledgeable.

It was perfect to walk to Times Square or any of the broadway district theaters. It is very close to the subway also. The rooms are tiny, but I'm pretty sure that's the normal for downtown NYC. They were clean and bedding was cozy. My only issue with this hotel was the breakfast buffet experience. We paid a little extra to have this location and the buffet breakfast Hampton is known for and both mornings of our stay the breakfast area was so crowded we had to eat standing up and/or bring things back up to our tiny room to eat. The food was great, but the crowded tables and buffet area made this part of our stay not enjoyable at all. We actually got snowed in due to a storm and we moved hotels the last night of our stay to avoid the morning chaos and decrease the price a bit. I'm hoping it's only because we happened to be there during a busy time, but I did see it on previous reviews as well.

No question, the location was wonderful...one block from the heart of Times Square. Now, one thing to keep in mind, NYC hotels are notoriously small, which we were expecting. The Hampton Inn room was clean but small. The double beds were only full sized, so with two adults and two teenagers, it was a tight squeeze. No refrigerator. The elevator system was an exercise in patience. Because a lot of people were traveling on these very small elevators, and if you had a room on one of the mid to lower floors and wanted to go to the ground floor...good luck. The elevators filled up quickly. Likewise, going up was difficult as well. In order to go up, you have to swipe your room key on the interior panel, then push a button. Imagine 20 people having to crowd one side of the elevator in order to go up to their rooms. On to valet service. Our car was parked across the street. It took AN HOUR for valet service to get our car when we checked out. Even the desk clerks were getting annoyed with the delay by valet staff. First time we did not tip valet service...ever.

I was a bit hesitant as I can be difficult to please when it comes to cleanliness (yes, I've been known to change hotels or purchase Clorox wipes and Lysol upon arrival and use them). We had a late flight and did not arrive at the hotel until after midnight. No problem. The front desk clerk was very welcoming and efficient. We were in our room within 15 minutes of arriving. Not only was our room ready, the location was perfect for us. Our window faced another building on a quiet street. Remember this is NYC- the city that never sleeps! We heard the occasional siren but nothing extreme. Considering its proximity to TS, I expected more noise. Thankfully, that was not the case. We opted for a room with a king bed and were not disappointed. Our 16th floor room was efficient, but nicely appointed considering that we were not in a 5 star hotel. If you are looking for luxury be prepared to pay for it and look along the Upper East Side/Central Park area. If you prefer a clean, nicely appointed, efficient space, serviced by hospitable, helpful employees, then this hotel should fit the bill perfectly. There are only 2 of us, so we did not have the same considerations as those traveling with children. We maneuvered the space with no problems. I suspect those that travel internationally or spend a lot of time in NYC will be more familiar with hotel room sq footage. It worked fine for us. As others have mentioned, during our stay the elevators were at capacity during the normal meal/arrival/departure hours. We did make the 15 flight trek downstairs a time or two in order to get to breakfast because we did not want to spend time waiting for the elevator. The breakfast options were standard for Hampton Inn and were replenished often. The breakfast crew was hard at work on the mornings we chose to eat breakfast at the hotel. They were also very kind when approached by guests making requests for specific items. We enjoyed hearing various languages (mostly European) at breakfast. The concierge was quite helpful when asked about area restaurants and made some ""off the beaten path"" suggestions that were appreciated. We thought the location was perfect for accessing the subway or walking to area attractions. The front desk also took care of hiring a car for our red eye departure on the last morning of our trip. The driver arrived a bit early and dropped us off at the airport without incident. If you are flying in/out of LGA, be aware of construction. Travelzoo provided a great rate for our trip.",,1,5.0

We used the Hop On Hop Off buses to get out bearings and then walked from the hotel to the Rockfeller Center, Empire State, Grand Central Station. Public Library and 5th Avenue shops. We also walked to see Anastasia at the Broadhurst Theatre three blocks away.The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. They weren't large rooms with only a single wardrobe, one bedside cabinet between the two double beds and one three drawer chest of drawers but there was enough room to put two large suitcases down on the floor. There was a large keypad operated safe in the wardrobe that would have been big enough to get a laptop in plus additional items. All the usual things in the room - hairdryer, coffee making facilities, shampoo, shower gel, tv with lots of channels, iron and board. Free WiFi which we found served all four of us well. Three lifts serving the 31 floors so at times there was a wait but never particularly long I felt. You needed your key to get it to go up which was reassuring. Credit card was asked for on check in but nothing untoward appeared on it and local phone calls were free. Reception staff were helpful and looked after our cases as we had to check out earlier than our pick up from the airport. Coffee, tea and water were available in the lobby as were warm cookies on occasion. There was also a range of groceries and medicines that you could pay for at reception but you should note there is no bar here although there are plenty of places to eat and drink in the area e.g. turn left out of the front door to find Schnippers a good burger place only a couple of minutes away. There was a good choice of items for breakfast all served with disposable tableware which we had expected and were fine with. Cereals, oatmeal, muffins, toast, bagels, fruit, yogurts, fruit juice, coffee and tea plus make-your-own-waffles were supplemented each day with a different variety of eggs and sausage or bacon.

We were on our honey moon. However, the failed to register the name of my wife at check-in, which caused that, in our SIXTH night at the hotel, when I was visiting a friend without my wife and had no cell phone signal or internet available because I live in another and my carrier doesn’t cover the U.S, they DID NOT LET MY WIFE IN!! She had her key but it stopped working, and she presented it at the front desk to a lady and a man that treated her VERY badly. My wife had been walking all day, she was tired and needed a bathroom. The people at the front desk had seen us all week, we had talked to them many times, we laghed together and they even helped us with pictures and cookies and other stuff the previous nights, and they pretended they had never seen her and told her that I had to call them to tell them she is my wife to let her in, because it is not costumary in our country that women take the husband’s last name, so our last names are different. For me this is unacceptable behavior. They had her stay at the lobby for about an hour, when luckily I was able to get in a wifi connection and saw all the messages she had sent me. I had to ask my friend for a phone and call the hotel just to literally say “she is my wife”. It is supposed to be a security measure but they didn’t ask me for personal data or any data that could tell them it was me calling... do you see the irony? It could’ve been anyone that she asked to call and say “she is my wife”. The man on duty, an almost bald guy, was the SAME guy the checked us in!! I could’ve understand if this happened the first nights, but we had many interactions with these people before this event occurred.

We also loved the sunset as we faced west, and could even see the Hudson in the distance.

Our room was very clean and service at all levels excellent, from the cleaning staff to the breakfast room to the front desk. They bend over backwards to help make your stay comfortable.

In fact, if not for the amazing staff, we probably would have switched hotels. The location is good for most people - very near to the 42nd street metro station, though it felt quite a ways ""off"" Times Square if you are looking for a central to Times Square location- it is nowhere near the DoubleTree or Marriott Marquis or the TKTS booth, for example. But it was just a short walk to the theaters we needed to go to and Bryant Park is just three blocks away, and the Port Authority hub is quite close. It's also close to a bunch of restaurants as well as Starbucks, CVS, Joe's Pizza and Whole Foods, so we found it convenient overall location-wise. And it's a ten minute walk or so (13 blocks) to Rockefeller Center, so not too bad. The rooms are small (as are the rooms in many NY hotels, but these felt smaller) and the hallways are super small/narrow. There are three elevators, so you don't have to wait too long if it's not a busy time of day. ice is on every other floor, so you have to walk up and down stairs to get ice. there was no refrigerator in the room (or microwave) so that really cut down on convenience (there's a microwave downstairs though). The beds are quite comfy but the shower is basically useless -so little water comes out that it takes quite awhile to actually shower! The heater and A/C worked well and the view from the upper floors was very good. Security is also quite good at this hotel and the area is nice, so you don't feel unsafe. There's plenty of homeless people you have to walk by to get to the hotel, but that's also quite normal for the area.... We tried the breakfast and found it pretty basic and not at all really appetizing, so we just walked outside and got food elsewhere each day. There is coffee/tea/water and hot chocolate in the lobby all the time and cookies in the afternoon - so that was really great. And the lobby is quite nice - easy to sit in and read or do work.

The reception desk had 4-7 people behind or near every time I passed by or walked up.Unfortunately, no one seemed to be able to know what they were doing or appeared distracted. I needed to retrieve my key fob before valet parking took my vehicle to the garage to get my cell phone. I counted five people working on this project when the fob was next to one of the computers at the desk the entire time. No one seemed to mind that I was standing wearing a knee brace and leaning on the reception desk to lessen the increasing pain. The motel requires that the room key be used on a key reader while selecting the floor in the lift. No employee told me this. I found out from another guest when I asked him to press ""7"". Using the key reader is not easy when one has the key in one hand, a cane in the other, and a bag hanging off the shoulder. Kudos for making the premises safer with this feature, but aren't you supposed to tell guests about it and help people with it if they are using a cane and a knee brace and have two bags.

The location can't be beat. It's in the Times Square and Broadway area, but just a couple blocks away so the lights and noise were not an issue. What made this hotel stand out was the front desk customer service. My sister in law dropped us off around 1:30. I had gone in with my kids to ask if we could store our luggage before check in at 3:00. Gentleman at the front desk said they could, but to cross my fingers and he might be able to do better than that. Sure enough, he checked and our room was ready. What a relief after getting up at 3:45 AM and flying half way across the country, to be able to check in and lie down for a few minutes before starting to explore the area. Everyone at the front desk had a smile and was very helpful. The room was bigger than expected. It was actually larger than the Hampton Inn in Joplin, MO where we have also stayed. In Missouri my girls and I could barely move around, in NYC we had space. I'd seen comment on Trip Advisor about the rooms being small, so I was pleasantly surprised. I heard much less noise than I expected from NYC so that was also awesome. Morning of checkout, I asked if I could store my luggage since our train didn't leave until 2:40 PM. I thought since we were done, they might want to flip the room for the next customer. The gentleman at the front desk said to stay until checkout, then Luis would be able to store the luggage. After returning and checking out, we stored the luggage then went back out. Luis offered to get us a cab when we collected our luggage, and when the cab drivers refused to take us on a short ride, he personally took us to the cab line at 8th Ave, telling us they could not refuse us a ride there. What a great help! With a heavy suitcase, the fact he took the extra time, was over and beyond. I just wish I could remember to the names of the two people that worked with me at the front desk. So, if a manager reads this, the front desk on November 9th and 10th were awesome. Great staff, so happy my search lead me to your location.","Kansas City, Missouri",7,4.0

We had the best time and the hotel was the PERFECT location. We arrived at about 12:30 in the afternoon, I had contacted the hotel beforehand to see if we could check in early due to having a long day of travelling, they stated that they could not guarantee it, however we were able to check in as soon as we arrived. We had booked a room with two double beds and we were not expecting much due to previous reviews. We staying in room 612 and there wasn’t much of a view but you go out for that anyway. The room was more than adequate, the beds were super comfortable. They were plenty of places to charge devices, including USB ports only which were ideal if you forget your plugs. There was a TV with a wide array of channels. A writing desk and chair. A separate chair and a full length mirror. There was also a closet which contained a safe which was free of charge to use and an iron and ironing board. The only downside would be that it was difficult to store cases in the room but we put them down the side of the bed and didn’t have a problem.The bathroom was great. It contained a bath with an overhead shower, a toilet, a sink with lots of storage space and a mirror with a light behind it which was great to get your make up done. House keeping were great as well, very friendly and attentive to the room. It was like stepping into a new hotel room every time you came back to your room. The beds were always made, the bins were emptied, toiletries were restocked and a general tidy was completed every day. The breakfast was great as well. Yes, it is somewhat basic but it’s included in the price. It stops you having to go out into the city and eat before you start the day. What more can you ask for. There were always two hot breakfast items on everyday which varied in contents. Some days there would be omelettes and maple sausages, other days there would be sausage patties. There was always waffles, toast, bagels, cereals, fruits, hard boiled eggs and yogurt available. There was also an endless supply of tea, coffee, water and fruit juices. There was something there for even the fussiest of eaters. It was a great way to start the day. There was also the option of a grab and go breakfast which contained a cereal bar, a bottle of water and a piece of fruit. We never used it but we thought it was a nice touch. At times the breakfast room can be busy but it’s to be expected when breakfast is complimentary for each and every guest staying in the hotel. We didn’t ever have an issue finding somewhere to sit down and eat. We would arrive between 8am - 9am. The lifts I have seen are a draw back for some guests, yes at times you have to wait a while because there are only 3 lifts. But again if you are finding criticism in hotel of this size because you have to wait a while for a lift then you’ve obviously got no patience whatsoever. The lobby was light, bright and colourful. It was a very welcoming and comfortable place to be. There was always complimentary tea, coffee and water available so you can just grab and go. At around 5pm they would put cookies out for the guests. Some guests would be really greedy and take way more than they needed, so get in there fast if you want a free cookie. The staff we’re very friendly and accommodating. There is also a food pantry within the lobby containing toiletries, drinks and snacks which is open 24 hours.The WiFi worked great, we didn’t upgrade and stuck to the free one. It worked well, I was able to upload, download and stream films without any issues. One downside would be having to log in every 24 hours to gain the WiFi but it took a matter of seconds to do. The location was literally perfect - you are down the road from Times Square and I mean that literally. You are close enough that you are a stones throw away without all the noise and hustle bustle constantly. You can walk to most major attractions as well which can help to save money and the hop on hop off bus is based around the corner as well and to the right. There are numerous subway stops close by as well. There are plenty of places to eat, drink, party, shop, buy snacks and there are endless photo opportunities. Would I return to this hotel? Yes, in a heartbeat!!! ","Staffordshire, United Kingdom",221,5.0

If you happen to forget anything such as toiletries, comb, toothbrush, shaving foam etc the hotel will provide it complimentary for you, really, they cant do enough for you. We felt totally confident leaving our personal items in our room. The room was cleaned to a high spec every day, you can choose if you would like fresh towels or to re-use them. The hotel provides free tea, coffee & chilled water 24hrs a day, which is most appreciated when you've been out walking all day. My only slight criticism would be that at peak times for breakfast you probably wont get a table, we found 6.30-7.30 you could get a table but any later is a struggle, although on the plus side they provide a grab bag if you're not planning to stay for breakfast.Our flight home wasn't until 9.30pm, check out was 12pm. The hotel happily stowed our luggage (securely in a separate room where they where tagged & we were given a receipt) Lewis at reception couldnt have been more helpful, he ordered us a Lincoln town car to take us to the airport which arrived on time, he also provided us with bottles of water & brownies to take away with us, which came in very handy!!I would highly recommend a stay at this very comfortable & clean hotel if you are planning a visit to Times square.

The hotel is a few blocks from central Times Square, less than a block to the subway station with access to most trains and within walking distance to most Broadway Theaters and a variety of restaurants and shopping. When we checked in as Elite members of Hilton, we were given complimentary bottled water and a snack. The key card is needed to go up to your floor but not to come down. However in the morning from about 8:30 am until about 10:00 am the ""UP"" elevator buttons do not function and it can be very busy trying to get an elevator going down especially if you are on a lower floor. It took us several tries to finally get a down elevator at 9:00 am in the morning.They serve a complimentary breakfast every morning from 6:30 am - 10:00 am (suggested timing 6-7 no waiting; 7:30-8:30 short lines and some delays; 8:30-10:00 heavier traffic with delays and waits for tables). The breakfast consists of some type of egg each morning and sausage or bacon, self serve waffles, oatmeal, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, toast, bagels, muffins, dry cereal, yogurt, milk, coffee, tea, juices. If you don't have time for breakfast, during the week, they provide a breakfast bag at the from desk that has a piece of fresh fruit, a muffin or breakfast bar and water that you can pick up on your way out of the hotel. There are 3 computer terminals and 1 printer that are in the ""business center"" of to the left of the front desk. You can get the password at the front desk. There is coffee, tea and water 24 hours a day just to the left of the front desk. There is a fitness center in the lower level (you need your key to get to the basement as well as to get in the fitness center. There are 4 treadmills, 2 Ellipticals, 2 bikes (1 upright, 1 recumbent), a weight bench, free weights, a weight machine, water, towels and headsets for the televisions. Bathrooms are outside the fitness room. There is also a guest laundry in the basement with washers and dryers ($2.00 per machine) but no change machines. The washers and dryers use quarters only, no credit cards. You can buy detergent from the pantry next to the front desk. The pantry also has sundries, snacks, beverages and frozen meals. There is a microwave in the pantry to heat up your meals.The rooms are average size with either a king or two queens. Our room was updated and had a walk-in shower, no bath tub. They only leave two sets of towels so if you need more be sure to ask the night before. There are plenty of outlets around the room and by the bedside as well as dedicated USB outlets. There is an iron and ironing board in the closet. In the evening they put out warm cookies for a snack at the front desk. The wi-fi is free but you have to log-in every 24 hours.The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful and the concierge service is very good. We used the services of both ""Cool Maureen"" and John and found both to be very knowledgable, helpful and patient. We took a cab in from the airport (La Guardia) but found out the hotel has a private car service for a flat $55.00 plus tip (up to 4 passengers) or a commuter bus for $21.00 per person with pick-ups at several area hotels. They will also flag a taxi for you in front of the hotel.We were very happy with this hotel and if coming to the Times Square area again, will definite think about staying here again.

We were able to pre-check into the room we wanted before we even left Arizona! We chose an upper floor for the view and the noise factor. We were next to the elevator, but never heard a thing. The room was very small with 2 full sized beds. It was a little cramped for three of us (my husband, granddaughter and me), but we got through it. They have the usual complimentary breakfast that we've had at every Hampton Inn we've ever stayed at. It is within walking distance of all of the theatre district and subways are close by. The only problem was the elevator situation. They are very small elevators and when we got there, only two of the three were operating. I would recommend staying on an upper floor because the elevator fills up fast, and those on lower floors (10 and under) sometimes had to wait until an elevator would show up with enough space left to get on.

On first arrival, we were greeted by friendly and funny staff. The guy checking us in was really friendly and helpful. We had booked a room with a city view and was given a room on the 29th floor. The room had a great view - you could even see some of the big lit up signs that were near the end of Times Square. The room itself was a decent size, especially for it being NYC. We had two queen size beds that were comfy and clean. The room also had a small desk with a chair and a big screen tv. The television got a lot of tv channels; a lot more than you normally get in a hotel room. The bathroom was a good size with a bathtub type shower. The room had it's own heating and cooling system separate from the hallway. However, we found it hard to regulate the temperature of the room. 68 degrees Fahrenheit was too cold; whereas, 70 degrees was almost too warm. But it wasn't a huge deal. The only real complaint we had about the room was that there wasn't really anywhere to put the suitcases. The way the room was set up it was hard to put your suitcase down without blocking a door. So maybe if there was a way you could put the suitcase under the bed, that would solve that problem. For the hotel itself, we liked that it offered a complimentary breakfast every morning. However, some mornings it was really hard to find a seat. Therefore, come early to beat the rush! Another important thing to note is that they only had three elevators servicing all 31 floors. At times, it took a while to get down or up - stopping at multiple floors.When it comes to the location of the hotel, it was amazing - one of the main reasons we chose this hotel. It was within walking distance to all of the Broadway theatres. We could easily walk to and from all of the shows in a matter of 15 minutes, and that was to the farthest theatre on 51st Street. Times Square was about a two minute walk. The hotel was also located right next to the subway station, so we could take that when going to other points of interest. We only had to take a taxi to and from the airport - it was nice to be able to walk everywhere! Lastly, the hotel had free wifi but you had to keep reconnecting after 24 hours which was kind of annoying. But the wifi was fast for the size of the hotel.

On the positive side, it’s very close to Times Square and the subway. The property has a good appearance and the staff was friendly. The breakfasts were standard Hampton Inn food - not great but not bad. The room size was okay but there isn’t much closet space or bathroom counter space. When we arrived we had four VERY small and flat pillows and asked for additional pillows. We also only had two bath towels. These towels were THE smallest and most worn out towels I have ever seen in a hotel; they should have been tossed a long time ago. We called and asked for more towels as well. It took another call but we eventually got the pillows and towels. I didn’t think it possible, but these towels were even worse than the two we had; the were frayed and literally had holes in them! The handle to the shower/faucet came off in my hand and water was spraying onto the floor. We eventually got it stopped - the handle never was fixed but we learned how to use it. Overall, not a bad place but not great either. It’s clear that this Hampton Inn was not using brand standard towels or bath mats. The room was quiet although the ‘blackout’curtain was coming off the rod. The room did have plenty of electrical and USB outlets.","San Antonio, Texas",16,3.0

Do not, I repeat, do not rent car. The wear and tear on your nerves not to mention the cost to park in down town New York City is ridiculous. Transit is excellent and if you are staying near Times Square you can walk to the majority of the attractions. Taxis are a standard mode of transportation but, be prepared for a bumper to bumper experience and most important of all, be patient! We found everyone to be very courteous and if you have questions, strangers were there to help without hesitation. A word to the wise, befriend the concierge at your hotel. They are an invaluable resource and well worth the tips you give them! Take the Gray Line 'Hop On Hop Off' tours and use the coupons that are an integral part of the package you purchase. Worth every penny. If you like your food and a great atmosphere try Carbone on West 38th St. for Italian and Benjamin Steakhouse Prime on 40th St. for steaks and no trip to NYC would be complete unless you eat at Kats'z Deli. This is where 'Harry Met Sally'. Take the table service option vs. self serve and ask for David to be your waiter. He can insult you and make you laugh at the same time. Most important, the food (Reuben and Pastrami sandwiches) is nothing short of awesome. For a quick lunch on the go, the street vendors offer a great cross section of culinary delights. Quite honestly we were a little nervous about trying this type of eating experience but, when in New York do what the new Yorkers do. Go for the Halal and any vendor that sells the famous New York hot dog. Grays Papaya sells the best hot dogs and don't ask how papaya and hot dogs are related! Stay away from Dallas BBQ on 42nd St. Enough said. A trip to NYC wouldn't be complete without seeing a Broadway show or two and buy your tickets before you go to get the best seats and prices. We saw Come From Away the story of the flights that were forced to land at the town of Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11 and how the 7000+ stranded passengers were hosted by the towns residents. If you are Canadian you will leave the theatre feeling very proud. We also saw School of Rock. Words cannot describe the awesome talent of the young people that perform in this musical. You will be on your feet more than you are in your seat, I can guarantee it. No trip to New York would be complete without visiting the 9/11 ground zero memorial. It is emotional and I will leave it at that. Do not miss Central Park and a horse drawn carriage or pedi-cab ride/tour. The Empire State building and Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center) are also must see attractions as is the harbor tour where you get up close to the Statue of Liberty. Anything short of a week in the Big Apple in my opinion does not give you enough time to see the major attractions. We stayed at the Hampton Inn on W 41st and our decision to do was based in part on breakfast being included with our room rate and the excellent location of the hotel to Times Square. The concierges (John and Maureen) at the hotel were an invaluable resource and made our stay that much more enjoyable. Enjoy your visit to one of the most interesting and vibrant cities ion the world.","Langley, BC, Canada",5,5.0

So friendly and helpful. She is a great ambassador for the hotel. Loved the grab bags in the morning -- the bottled water was nice as we were on the town all day. My only ""issue"" was that we usually had to wait for an elevator in the morning. They were usually full by the time they got to the 16th floor.

The room was clean and comfortable and had a great view from the 23rd floor. After settling in, we went downstairs and met John, the concierge. We told him what we wanted to do and that we only had a short time to do it in. He proceeded to help us plan the whole 3 days and was there every step of the way for us! He was awesome!! Another great feature of this hotel is a free breakfast each morning...which is rare in NYC! That is where we met Teddy the breakfast hostess. She was there each morning asking us how every thing was and if she could clear away plates etc. Teddy was courteous, efficient, and very friendly!

I want to give a special shoutout to the hardworking men and women who make that place run smoothly. Especially Teddy, Mia, Olivia, Keda, and Gisela who work in the kitchen and dining area during breakfast time! I was shocked to find out these women were not regularly tipped. The dining area is pretty accessible if it were not busy and a stool was there but those were only provided in my room. (Two stools were set up in my room when I arrived! So cool.) The dining area is crowded every day with lots of people and if you need to take the elevator just make sure you leave 10-20 min early (especially if you're in a wheelchair because no one is giving up their spot on the elevator trying to get downstairs in the morning. Every single day I stayed at this hotel these compassionate women helped me get breakfast and served me and I observed them not only helping people who needed help getting to a table, but cleaning up every table in between and wiping them down, on top of getting people gluten free bread, asking people if they needed anything, and remembered my name. At one point they knew what I wanted to eat, how they could help me on a day when I needed to take my food and run to an early call... they were so nurturing and not just to me but to others as well. The people at the front desk are hardworking and were always ready to help and the guy who sells the tickets is a riot!!! There are 3 elevators inside the lobby which is not far at all from the entrance. I would say though that they do get very busy during certain times of the day when everyone is trying to leave at once. The front desk is tall but there's a wide open space on one side to get someone's attention. I sent a lot of mail home to Los Angeles and they were very accommodating with receiving packages and letters as well. Loved my stay!

The room is pretty average and did not even have a refrigerator. The bathroom was tiny and not enough space to keep your things.

Surprisingly this Hampton Inn hit a home run and the price was lower than just about everywhere save for the seedy ultra budget hotels. Highlights: Beautiful view from my room on the 26th floor Fresh coffee, water, and warm cookies in the lobby Free breakfast. Yes it's crowded. So what? It still only takes a quick minute to grab your food and the selection is solid. Stylish and comfortable lobby that isn't too small The staff is friendly and helpful Location is as good as anywhere in the vicinity. My king room had more than ample space and I appreciated the contemporary bathroom with glass stand up shower. This isn't your typical mid-town laugh out loud small room. It is just right! Hilton Honors members (free) can select their own room and get a digital key. No need to even stop at the front desk when checking in- go straight to your room. HD television with directv. Best hotel TV experience I've had. Lowlights: I don't like the purple carpet and curtains and black headboard. Too drab! Furniture has taken a good beating. Good luck finding a hotel in manhattan with a desk or closet without some scuffs This isn't a luxury hotel. You won't feel like a high roller or an aspiring millionaire here. It isn't ""special""- I got over that really fast when I realized those ""special"" hotels often have worse service, no free breakfast, and are in smaller buildings with tiny windows and often views of a brick wall. I obsessed like an OCD crazy person and spent a dozen hours looking for a hotel for this trip because it was fashion week and prices were at a premium. I thought I would be missing out if I didn't stay at a more premium hotel like the hyatt centric (been there- it's great- but not worth the extra cost), the Westin, the W Times Square, or the much more expensive Hilton time square across the street. Or the boutique hotels all over midtown east. Well guess what? This hotel is absolutely all anyone could reasonably hope for. If you aren't going to stay at a $500+ per night 5 star luxury hotel, then just stay here. It's basically as good as anywhere else- all you are missing is the ""I am so rich!"" feeling.

Hot selection changes daily plus fresh fruit, yogurts, pastries but best is make your own waffles fresh you may have to wait for waffle machine but they are worth it especially with breakfast syrup maybe cream yum yum.The hotel is right round the corner from Times Square so you are right in the thick of it all.Didn't find a decent pub for a drink and a dance in the evening but lots of places to eat and lots to see.We don't mind walking and you see so much more, so central park is easy to get to and well worth a visit we even got to go there at night and watch Saturday night fever for free so check to see whats going on in the park as they have lots going on even a free concert by Paramore on Good Morning america but it was at 8-8:30am so also listen to whats said in the morning (Jason Darulo following week).Book a bus tour maybe 48 hour pass just to see the sights plus if you like an area you can hop off then hop back on later, also gets a boat tour thrown in with ours and can have a night tour as well.If your there for a while get a subway week ticket (approx $24) then you can travel all over the place some people we met went to Coney Island which has a beach (something different) or go to a shopping outlet as its much cheaper than a bus trip which costs maybe $40 each.Go to the Harbor and take the Staten Island ferry its FREE so its a free boat trip not much the other side but we sat over looking NYC having a beer in the sun (also cheaper beer as its out of the city).Very hot in August upper 80s but lovely air con that really works in the hotel bedroom.Empire state is about $55 each to go to the very top or about $20 cheaper if you only go to the 86th floor the views are spectacular we had a hot sunny day so great.we had a partial (70%) solar eclipse which you cant just order up as the last one was over 100 years before so watching it under the Brooklyn bridge just amazing, If like us you want to walk the Brooklyn bridge do it as its free but take a drink as you cant get one on the bridge but you can get fresh melon fruit etc but at a price.its only a mile but it is very busy watch out for cyclists as they just go for it.As city breaks go New York lives up to the city that never sleeps it was amazing.Also if you get hungry in the night right opposite the hotel is a huge McDonald's.The hotel location is right in the heart of the action so if you want an action filled break go for it.

I used points to spend 5 nights at this location at the end of July. The Customer Service was prompt and outstanding. After using the iPhone App to check in, I wanted to see about maybe choosing a different room, so I used the ""send a message"" feature in the app. They responded in less than a minute and changed the room assignment for me. I asked them about a refrigerator because the person travelling with me needed to keep their medication cold, and they put one in the room free of charge. The breakfast was quite sufficient, though we did walk to Grand Central Station to enjoy Zara's bagels once we realized they had a location there. :)The location was perfect! Easy walk to Times Square, the theaters, and multiple mass transit locations - Metro, Port Authority, etc. No problems at all taking the F Train out to Citi Field to see ""The Classic East"" concert. We put lots of steps in enjoying the sights.One little tip: The TKTS booths are great, but if you go to the remote location down at Seaport, you'll find a lot less traffic than Times Square, better hours, and great ticket availability. We walked right up to the window at about 1:30 to purchase tickets for a show on Friday evening.I would happily return to this hotel on a future visit to NYC.

Access to metro abounds and there never is an issue getting a cab from the hotel.Stayed in a standard room on the fifth floor for four nights. The rooms are functional of a fairly decent size as per New York hotel room standards , bathrooms again compact but well designed . The room was fairly well insulated though the room didn't have much of a view. The bed was large and quite comfortable . The TV had all the mainstream popular channels including a couple of movie channels as well.Given we were going to be out through most of the day and evenings and merely returning for a nights rest we found the room and the hotel facilities fairly acceptable . However if you wish to spend more time within the hotel property then maybe this is not the place .The hotel organizes breakfast for those who opt for it and while one lauds their effort unfortunately the venue is way too crowded and the self service buffet table hard to access . The fare on offer is not fancy but wholesome such as cereals milk, fruits some form of bacon and eggs. Also there is free flow of tea and coffee through the day in the hotel lobby and a specially nice gesture was for them to organize freshly baked cookies every day in the lobby .The biggest improvement area I felt was the wait time for the elevators during peak hours in the morning. On a couple of occasions I had to trudge down from the fifth floor as there would be no lift access at all possible .To sum up if you are a first time visitor on a budget looking to spend around $130 to $170 per night for a clean centrally located hotel then this place is for you.

First of all, there are only 3 elevators for 31 flights, and none of them are service elevators. This means, the room service & housekeeping staff uses their key cards to bypass the elevators to meet their needs. The outcome? Paying customers have to WAIT. Advice: When checking in, ask for a LOWER level room so that you can take the stairs!! 2nd beef: The continental breakfast HOARDERS!!! A word of advice to Hampton....if you want all of your customers to be able to grab a bite for breakfast, PLEASE make it a rule that NOBODY leaves the room with more than a plate of food (not a take-away container). I realize some people bring food up for kids/family who are sleeping a bit later (acceptable), but people will take FULL advantage of the word ""FREE"". I witnessed families taking 3-4 plastic take-away containers, filled with ALL of the muffins, banana bread and pastries -- to the point where the other guests were left with NONE, then proceeded to fill their pockets with bananas and oranges. One lady zoomed to grab the last 4 omelets, knowing there were others behind her in line. Don't allow the selfishness of some to ruin it for your other paying customers. Set a standard of etiquette for these gluttonous idiots, to get a life and buy their carbs outside!!

Our room was clean and amenities comfortable. I loved the beds here, we found them so comfortable. The breakfast is included when you stay and it gets extremely busy, the sitting area is small for the amount of guests that stay here so once we couldn't even have our breakfast because there were no seats left. I suggest you go down early for best selection and a seat to sit in. The range is good, both hot and cold, and freshly cooked waffles are always my favourite. The location of the hotel was right in the thick of things so if you want that, it's great. The theatres right there at the doorstep, restaurants by the dozens, people everywhere, bus terminal only a couple of minutes walk away and the lights of Times Square a short walk away. If you want a less ""full on"" experience, because the people are so many here, then stay further away from this area.

Teddy has got to be one of the hardest working and most pleasant people in NYC. While we were there the breakfast room was PACKED. Lines for waffles, people sharing tables with other parties, etc. Teddy was constantly on the move making sure everything was fully stocked and interacting with the guests with an incredibly positive attitude.

About a block from Times Square, and a subway station with multiple lines at the end of the street. The service at this property is top notch. Everyone there goes out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. And as mid-town hotel prices go, this property is quite reasonable. However, be aware there are several issues that keep this hotel getting an Excellent rating. First, the three elevators are inadequate during the breakfast/check out rushes in the morning. So be prepared for a wait. Second, the breakfast room gets crowded around 9am so you may have a short wait for a table. Finally, while we heard no noise from the adjoining rooms, the street noise (even on the 16th floor) is noticeable at night. So request a back room if this will be an issue for you. We were fine by just running the A/C fan continuously. Other than these issues, this is a great hotel and we would definitely stay there again.","Youngstown, Ohio",153,4.0

They had heavy doors which blocked the hallway noise. Now for the areas that need improvement.... the elevator traffic in the morning was pretty bad. My suggestion to the hotel is to dedicate one of the elevators to the hotel cleaning crew and staff. You had to wait a long time for the elevators in the morning due to the breakfast traffic, people checking out as well as the hotel cleaning staff. The breakfast area was also over crowded.

Great sleep quality - Hampton beds are always good. Given the hotel is in noisiest part of the city, the room was really quiet. You can still hear sirens on this floor, but no other street noise. The A/C system has a constant fan option that's a good source of white noise. Enjoyed and appreciated free coffee/tea/water 24/7 in the lobby. Especially given I was there during a heat wave. Nice to get back to home base when it's 1,000 degrees out and grab some refreshment right away. I did not try the free breakfast - I was up too late or running out too early.

I stayed here because I got a good deal, I'm a Hampton fan, and the reviews were good. The elevators are awful. On my last day, a group of us actually got stuck in a car that would not stop at the lobby and kept going up and down. I had luggage so could not take stairs. A nice man working on the problem rescued me from the 21st floor. It took 20 minutes to get from room to lobby. One evening, after a long day, I came back and all the hallways were dark, except for emergency lights. There was no hot water, internet or TV for a few hours. Not sure if the heat wave affected systems. The shower water pressure is very weak. The TV remote requires an engineering degree to figure out. I thought I'd seen every hotel remote on several continents, but this one stumped me. The towels are prison-issue scratchy. Wi-fi was OK and I was able to watch Netflix with a few hiccups.

We have stayed in many NYC hotels. On this trip back across the pond, we stayed for two nights. Definitely, look for Geraldine in the mornings when you have breakfast, you'll never forget this Irish lass.Check-in was fast, efficient and the staff was delightful. We requested and received a king bed and this room had a view. Our room was perfectly clean, comfortable with a very fresh design.When starting a day in NYC, breakfast is important! We have our favorite breakfast diners; however, the no-cost Hampton breakfast kept us here. A large comfortable dining room, with tables and booths, was available for guests. Breakfast offered varied selections, including cereals, oatmeal, eggs, sausage or bacon, yogurts, fresh fruit, bakery items...the list is long. Of course, juices, soda, coffee, and tea were available. Coffee cups for take-out were available. The lobby is not large, but well-planned. The lobby has different areas for relaxing, reading, watching TV, internet/computer access for guests, who may be waiting for a taxi, an event, a delayed plane or those needing a break..I loved the rooftop terrace. Open to guests, a different perspective of NYC is so cool from the top! You'll want to go up to the terrace and at least take some photos. The view to the north toward Central Park is great and a block away...a little bit of Times Square can be seen! When we were ready to leave, an SUV was made available (at a cost) for our trip to the airport. We have stayed at many other very nice and pricey NYC hotels. For first-time NYC/Manhattan visitors or those wanting a central NYC location, this Hampton would be my choice. We had a bad experience two weeks earlier before our trip overseas, so we cancelled a second reservation there and came here. (See review.) This hotel exceeded our expectations and it was the best decision we ever made. Our stay capped off a two week 20th anniversary trip and left us with wonderful memories. Cheers to the Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square Central! We'll be back. Very highly recommended. Don't forget Geraldine!!!","Edmond, Oklahoma",320,5.0

The location is great! Within 3 short blocks of the show we went to see, walking distance to everything. Free wifi included. Cons: You could tell that like most hotels, they don't change the outer bed sheets (the comforter had minor makeup on it) but the inner sheets were clean (I checked all the way to the mattress). I didn't like that the bathroom door is a sliding door that leaves a small crack. I was sharing the room with my sister and we had to make sure not to stand where we could look into the crack to ensure privacy.

He was very friendly and courteous. He made sure that we knew everything about our room and where all the hotel major service areas were located. (breakfast area, fitness room, business area, etc.) He told us to contact him if we had any questions. The room was great. It had a good view of the east side of the city. It was moderate in size. The bed was very comfortable. We did have to get used to the slider door to the bathroom due to privacy concerns but it did save on space. The room overall was very comfortable. The breakfast area was large and very busy. We chose to go during the less busy times. The food selection and variety were very good. There were plenty of healthy foods to choose from. Geraldine and Teddy were very friendly and helpful in assisting us in locating a table and in making sure we were happy with the breakfast. Raymar and Ninoska were also helpful when we decided to stay any additional night. They made sure we got a really good room on the 31st floor – western view of the city. It was a beautiful view. As we checked out, Johnny helped us in getting our Uber driver. We appreciated his help. We thought this was a great additional service of the hotel.

On the second day that were there, I was not feeling well at all and I ask if it would be possible to get an order of scrambled eggs. She was right on it.

Throughout our stay breakfast room was ok for first few days and we were able to get a seat, however after that we was often waiting up to 10 minutes to get a seat.

When you do get a seat, other people are then waiting right behind you throughout your entire breakfast meal to make sure they then get your seats which is very off putting ! The free tea and coffee was a nice touch in the evenings but never saw the free cookies.We did also tell the manger Kevin about our smelly soiled mattress on arrival and still 3 days later this was never sorted, I then spoke to other staff as well Kevin again and I have to say yet again they did not sort this the entire stay and was not bothered.

In the event you want to get out of the hotel in a timely manner when the hotel is full you are in bad luck. The staff is aware of the situation and there is nothing they can do to make it better. The cleaning crew due to the weight of the cleaning carts causes the elevators to bypass floors when the cleaning equipment is on the elevators. When an elevator finally came after twenty minutes it stopped at nearly every floor on the way down so it took about 25 minutes for me to get down. People were actually walking down stairs from different floors. There are plenty of other similar options in the Times Square area that are competitively priced without this problem.

The decor was modern and nice, and the entire hotel felt clean and well-kept. One weird thing was the bathroom door was closed with a barn-door style closure. So at times the privacy was awkward as you could hear everything in the bathroom. Also at night it did get loud (as I'm sure any hotel in the city would), but we just ran the fan and it was fine.The location was amazing, as we were in the hard of times square. We walked or took the subway everywhere as there were 2 subway stations within a block or 2. I felt this was a perfect location to do activities both uptown and downtown. The breakfast was great - made our stay so much easier, as food in NYC can get expensive. We started out each day with waffles, oatmeal, toast, eggs - they really had a great selection of food. The seating area did get crowded, but if we were patient a table would tend to open within a few minutes. The front desk folks were really nice and even offered us a room on a higher floor.

The price of the rooms is amazing for a hotel so conveniently located. The free breakfast is a huge plus. It is a standard Hampton Inn Breakfast (waffles, eggs, bacon, juice, yogurt, pastries) but there is lots of food. You need to go before about 8:30 if you don't want to stand in line, and if you want a table. If you don't want to sit down for breakfast, they have a grab and go bad, with a bottle of water , a muffin and a granola bar. They have all day tea, coffee and hot chocolate, and at 5 they bring out hot cookies. They are great! The rooms are clean and well appointed. There is no fridge unfortunately. The rooms are a good size for a NYC hotel. I would not pay extra for cityview. My room was up on one of the highest floors, and I actually had a worse view than my friends, who were well below me. Plus, there are only 3 elevators, and you have to wait for them at times, so a lower floor, where the stairs would be an option would be good.

Unpleasant service from all the receptionists (except the nice chubby guy who checked us out) - they should learn how to smile to their guests and greet them at least. Also, guest services have no idea about telephone standards, they need training. They are not efficient either: we asked an extra towel the first day and it was never delivered. Housekeeping did not make up our room the day before our departure - we had to call to request new towels. Bed sheets had several stains and the HK staff have not attention to details at all (they don't remove hair on the shower grill and the day we checked in we found an hair in the toilet too)If you improve the logistic during breakfast and give some proper training to front desk, guest services and HK this could be an amazing mid to low budget choice to visit NYC",Italy,6,3.0

We had a wonderful stay, though brief. Our family of 2 adults & 1 teen took advantage of the park and stay package for a weekend stay. The parking rates in the area were high, even with discounts, when staying overnight -- this deal beat those prices PLUS it was convenient. The rate covers 24 hours from the time you arrive (x number of days), which worked out perfect for us. We we arrived later in the day & on our departure date, left our bags with the desk when we checked out bust continued to explore the city. As will all NYC hotels, you need to call for the car 30 minutes before you need it since it is in a nearby garage. From curbside to front desk -- breakfast room to cleaning staff navigating the hotel, each and every person was happy AND happy to help. A mix up checking in... same last name as another guest-- had us land in the wrong room. The staff could not work quick enough to get us settled and wanted to make sure we were happy. The hotel is new and well kept. One of the cleanest hotels I have stayed at in NYC. New does not always mean well-kept -- this place was sparkling! We had a double on the 24th floor. Small rooms in the city, but I have seen smaller (and pricier). There were plenty of towels, extra blanket, fully stocked toiletries, and water bottles from the front desk (a Hilton Honors thing - recommend signing up). The bathroom had a sliding frosted door with wood frame which was not a great sound barrier. Attractive design but not the best for soundproofing. We were high up and had no issues with road noise. Nice view. We were across from the elevators and had absolutely NO issues with noise from the hallway. Breakfast was delicious and well stocked. Everything was clean and plentiful. The room was spacious and comfortable--TVs around but not overbearing. Tables mostly, but a little bar type seating area as well. The feature of breakfast being included in the price is only worthwhile if the food is good - and it was! Checkout was fast and everyone was eager to help. We checked our bags behind the desk so we could spend some extra time in the city. There were several staff members on hand, taking the bags, closing out the bill, etc. They seemed to enjoy working together -- that positive energy gave the entire place a ""good vibe"". There was never just one person helping-- staff members were always stepping forward and reaching out. Even coming back for the car, they were asking about us, our stay and making sure we were comfortable until the vehicle arrived. We are already looking forward to our next stay at this hotel.

The breakfast area was about the size of a breakfast area at a 4 or 5 story Hampton, so, with 25 floors of people, you can imagine it was packed. That being said, they do try and give you fair warning about the hotel breakfast being busy. Also, allow extra time if you valet parked your car.

Arriving at 8pm on NYE it was a struggle getting to the hotel as Times Square was closed off, we finally made it :)Arriving all excited and ready to kick off our NYE experience in NY we were unfortunately greeted by a rude young lady at reception. We asked if there were any nice local bars where we could go for a drink and was told “everything’s closed, it’s new years eve”. We then asked if the hotel had a bar and was told “no!”. Ok, so we are in New York and everything is closed, great. Fortunately one of our party had emailed Jessica, the assistant manager ahead of time. Jessica had informed us she’d leave a few notes at reception for us upon arrival with a few tips on what to do and where to go. So we asked the young lady at reception if anything had been left to which she replied “No! Nothing!”. Not what you expect when paying $700 for a single night on NYE.The lady then proceeded to take a huge £500 security deposit from my card during check in, why I’ll never know, the basic breakfast is included and there’s no bar, so not sure what they thought I’d be spending £500 on?Anyway my friend who had been in contact with Jessica emailed her immediately, Jessica instantly called us and apologised for the awful service during check in, she also suggest a few nice bar which were in fact open. We proceeded to head out to a bar Jessica recommended and had a fantastic night. Thanks Jess :)The selection at breakfast was basic, to put it politely it was like a mass free for all. People could walk in off the streets for breakfast if they wanted to, no check in in, no being seated, just stroll in and help yourself. Seating is limited so every morning people were spilling out into reception munching on their food, one family was even slumped over the iMac computer in reception eating their breakfast.Anyway all of the negatives aside, the hotel is in a fantastic location, close to everything you’d need.

I stay at a lot of Hilton family hotels, and have stayed at several in Manhattan with family over the years. The gentleman who checked us in (Togo) was delightful. Helpful, kind, playful and handsome to boot! I liked the security the hotel had in the elevators, requiring guests to touch their room keys to a pad in order to select their floor. (I've had this on ""select"" floors before, but never for everyone. It was a comfort, knowing the elevators are right off the street and anyone could walk on.) We stayed in room 2409, which had a nice view south, and met all our simple needs, but was rather tiny. I reminded myself that it is Manhattan, and I wasn't paying top dollar for this room.... for what I paid, and where it was, it was perfect. The room was well maintained, and the bathroom renovated in a decor similar to the other Hilton family brands. My only gripe about Manhattan hotels (this being the 3rd in the Times Square area I've stayed at in the last 3 weeks), is the food service hours. This hotel doesn't have room service (which ended by 10pm in other hotels), but it does serve breakfast. Unfortunately the breakfast ends at 10am, and we missed it when we slept in late.

This is a new bldg I believe because I asked the front desk. I even mentioned their laundry area on site which. First issue. We were at front desk lobby asking to fax 1 pc of paper. I ask Ms Maria to reset my key and then ask for my name etc etc, then that's fine. She initiated the statement telling us ""I'm sorry if it's taking so long"" then I noticed that she just ignored me and hand over the key to My partner. For me it's kinda insulting. I hand over the key to be restarted corrected then he hand it over to the other person. My name is on the room also. Though it's kinda different since I hand it to her and gave it to the other person, in front of us. I don't mind it not raising it as an issue but insulting. Probably she just don't know and it's fine. Secondly, the wait. We reserved thru HH App because of the promo. Now while I check the reservation on the app, the reservation was doubled and we only need one room and are checked in. I went to front desk again and told the person the situation. He then told me to call the HH 1800 number. As I called the lady at HH line was very nice like the true spirit of the hospitality as the true meaning of a hotel. She called this hotel itself and it made my call to them 50 mins. We have to cut our call since it's super extra ordinary for this type of issue for a A corporate office calling the branch or franchisee to have this Loooong wait. Ending issue unresolved but sending me an email for this. Then come the Manager of the particular hotel whom I felt being discriminated (pardon the wrong use of word - if it comes that way-I'm a tourist guess to this hotel). She just as the same case with Maria whom I believe is white like the Manager, I even asked my partner to introduce me to her but just kept on ignoring me. Finally, my partner just acknowledged the error even he don't understand technical issues with the HH app on our phones. Ms Manager said as a courtesy. She is waiving the cancellation fee for being HH member. Seriously? Then I really interjected for me to step in and my partner then told the manager to speak to me. The she looked at me. I finally started my piece and just said ""my issue is not ended since I was the one on the phone that have your beach made me and the corporate on the phone for 50 mins just because of that"". and she just said that's why she had taken care of that. It just made me think again, if she did paid attention to what I just said and I realized that no she did not, when I'm already at the elevator going to my room. "" for me issue was only partially resolved. Because the detail becomes more because of her very intelligent reply to my issue which is not fully understood and have paid attention. I will just communicate with the HH corporate because for me, this was just another not so good example of what customer service business they are in. New York hotel rates are expensive among the cities that I have been to any of the states that I have been to as well. New York, NY it's fabulous that's why they named it twice. Like the song New York, NY, when you survived it you'll make it anywhere. This quality of customer service for me is not among that will pass my standards as a tourist coming from the other part of the world. We pay high price to stay in a not so luxorious hotel from our hard end money that somewhat contributed to the salary of the hotel employee as well being a Diamond tier (which is the highest and last tier) membership for this hotel chain. I'm sorry, if my standards for the quality of customer service satisfaction become so low if what I felt it is not met. Anyways, this is just a review and it's readers decision still remains valid or not if their ways are good enough to survive particularly to the business Hampton Inn is in.

The bed was nice and comfy but the duvet cover did look a little tired and the pillows were extremely soft.

Good location, clean rooms and public areas, very friendly staff. Quiet room, but hallway noise was easily heard, especially on the weekend.

Breakfast was really nice, not having to go out, it's all right there, with very helpful breakfast room staff. Bad elevator wait times during peak hours (morning/evening), but one out of 3 elevators was broken during a portion of our stay. No big deal, we were on vacation. We booked our stay well in advance and prepaid the full amount. At checkout, they had $490 of extra charges on my bill, and had already charged it to my card on file!!!?? Front desk staff insisted that they were right, until I got out my paper receipt from the original online booking showing that I was paid in full. They reluctantly refunded the charges to my card upon seeing all my paperwork. This whole ordeal checking out took 45 minutes and nearly caused us to miss our flight.

I've never stayed in such a small place in all of my travels and I am mostly loyal to Hilton brands. Check in was great. Couldn't have asked for better. It was a busy weekend so I didn't expect much. The elevators were small although there were three. With that being said I spent a lot of time waiting on elevators and even had to take the stairs up to the 12th floor a few times. Thank God I didn't get the 20th floor room I had originally requested. We did take advantage of the coffee and tea bar. That area stayed crowded but it worked. Two people can't walk down the hallways at the same time. The room was sooooo tight that we had to stay packed at all times. Any thing outside of your luggage made the room look junky and cluttered. We couldn't even store the luggage in the closet because it was small too. It was the size of a small coat closet with a safe and tray on the floor. We parked the luggage against the space by the window to move it out of the way. I will say the room was very clean and housekeeping was on top of keeping it that way. The bathrooms on the concourse were very clean with the amount of traffic. They get an A+ for cleanliness and service We did get back to the room one might just in time for cookies. Don't understand how cookies can make you feel so thankful but they do. The price we paid was astronomical but we expected that for New Years Eve on Times Square. You could literally walk out of the door to the corner and see the ball drop and you are inside of the police barricade so that's goes along with the price. My husband is f firefighter so his badge allows us to go a little further, down to the center, by the stage. This hotel is a perfect location for your TSQ visit. It is out of the way of the 42nd street traffic but just steps away from everything. We only ate breakfast there once but was so crowded that we decided to forego breakfast and just do lunch outside of the hotel. Would I stay there again....Maybe.....but only if the Hilton is completely booked. Space is very important to me.

It is hard to get a table but you can bring your food to your room if you wish. There are also prepacked brown bags with muffins and fruit always available during breakfast hours that you can just grab and take with you. I loved that that are three separate coffee stations so there is never a wait for coffee. I requested a room on the third floor because of the reviews that I had read about the elevators being packed.

The room size was adequate, the bed was comfortable, and everyone was very friendly. We checked out the breakfast buffet and it was your typical free breakfast hotel food. My only wish is that I requested a quiet room since I have a hard time sleeping in unfamiliar places, and they only put us at the 15th floor, which you could still hear a lot going on in Times Square, even later at night. I wish they would have put us in a higher floor, as sometimes it was a bit tough for me to sleep with the street noises.

The room is quite spacious for NY standards, and very clean. At the time we stayed there, we noticed that there was construction on a building behind us. They used the air horn all the time in the morning, which could be annoying to some, but it wasn't a problem (and nothing the hotel could do about it, anyway). There are only three elevators, so sometimes you have to wait a bit, but it wasn't that big of a problem. The best part of the property is the location. We had the subway, Times Square, Penn Station, Broadway, etc. within easy walking distance. At no time did we feel unsafe in or around the property. And there are lots of great restaurants nearby.

The Nederlander theater next door was dark, so the block felt a little gloomy, however, walk half a block more and you're at restaurants, the Subway, etc... We paid more for the City View so we had a partial view of the Empire State Building. If you have theater tickets, its a close walk to many attractions and restaurants. Good price, includes breakfast, coffee all day long, computers, and the staff was all very friendly.We traveled the week after Christmas so the hotel was packed. 3 small elevators are clearly are not enough to support 30 floors of guests. I felt bad for guests on lower floors as we would pass floor after floor of disappointed people trying to get inside to go downstairs to breakfast. Which leads to the next constraint, table seating for breakfast. The staff in the kitchen actually did a great job of keeping the food stocked, I have seen much worse but this group stayed ahead of the crowd. What was lacking was a place to sit once we had food. With the poor elevator situation, going back to your room with an arm full of food was out, so we saw a lot of people just go grab a seat in the lobby and balance a plate on their lap. I'm sure management already knows this is an issue because they put out ""to go"" breakfast bags as an option. Nice try but it doesn't resolve the space limitations. The room itself was small, but clean. Room for two double beds and and a desk, that was it however its NYC, we were not in the room very much anyway except to sleep. Mattress was hard, not my style but it was fine for a few nights. Overall for NYC, with breakfast included and one block from 42nd street, I would stay again. Just bring your patience.P.S.

We even did that a few times despite the fact we were on a floor above 20. Our room had no mini-fridge or ice bucket and nor was there ice available anywhere near our floor. There is no room service, so we had to go out for everything - hard given the challenge of getting to and from our room using the lifts!!! Add to this the fact that breakfast is a badly disorganised scrum - with very ordinary food served to an overpacked room where we were often unable to find a seat - so we just gave up and ate elsewhere. To be fair, the rooms are comfortable and staff generally positive and friendly - but a free chocolate chip cookie doesn't make up for such an overall terrible experience.

So the grading range is pretty narrow. Have stayed at most of the Hiltons, Hamptons, Garden Inns in midtown, but first time here -- and probably last time. On the plus side, I think the location is great. A relatively quiet location one short block from the craziness of 42nd and 7th/Broadway. The rooms are a decent size (at least my room was), the A/C and heat work well, good TV and channel selection, very friendly staff. On the down side, the hotel is under-elevatored, so on a lower floor in the mornings, can easily have several elevators full of upper floor guests stop before you get one with space. On upper floors, can be a good wait while elevators work their way up. The breakfast area is undersized and a madhouse during much of the morning (we just ate at the Gleason a few steps down the street - well worth the extra expense). And our room and floor whistled. By that I mean that the heat/air system was sufficiently strong, and the door in our room hung in a particular way, such that there was a constant wind-like whistling in our room (also in the30th floor hallway). Solved by stuffing a towel under or room door. But the worst was the pillows and bedding. OK, you may think that's crazy, but the room is ultimately a place to sleep, and that was a bit of a challenge for me. The pillows were about the limpest I have ever had in a hotel (was at a dude ranch a few years ago that was worse, but never at a big hotel). Not sure if they were just lousy pillows or were well passed their replacement time, but virtually no support. And the hotel uses a very heavy duvet on the bed (I recall Hampton went this direction once, but do not know if this is still a system wide Hampton thing). In any event, unless you like to be VERY warm in bed, finding a comfortable sleep temperature can be iffy. So why stay here? Again, location and fir my stay, price for the location. Doubt I will stay here again. The Garden Inn on 42nd is a better hotel for me. A bit noisier location, and pay for breakfast, but better sleep quality for what is often about the same price.","Berlin, Germany",62,3.0

They have 3 elevators and never had to wait long for one. The complimentary breakfast (6am to 10am) each morning was very good. Eggs (scrambled, hard boiled, or omelets), a meat (bacon, sausage), fruit, make your own waffles with plenty of toppings, cereals, oatmeal, yogurt, bagels, danish, muffins, etc... Even though we had read it can be very crowded, we never had a problem getting food or finding a seat. But getting there early is helpful to beat the rush. In the evening they have warm cookies at the front desk. 24/7 hot coffee, tea and hot chocolate at the front desk area as well.

Very convenient location right off Times Square. Beautiful lobby. Very nice front desk staff.You have to swipe your room-key before you can push the button for any floor of this thirty floor hotel. It's so annoying sitting there while everyone swipes their cards and pushes their room numbers. Try having two cups of coffee and swiping your card and pushing a button. It cannot be done. I appreciate security but this is not the answer. I had several issues with the room. For NYC the room was a decent size. I did not like the sliding door on the bathroom as you really have no privacy due to large gaps in-between the door and the wall on both sides. It looks cool but it does not function well. The curtains are totally inadequate to cover the windows. I could not get the room dark and when you have a room right off of Times Square there is so much flashing light coming through the windows it made it difficult to sleep. This is a very noisy hotel. We were put next door to a room with multiple children. Interesting thing about that is that this family had two rooms and the hotel put their other room across the hall instead of next door so there was lots of kid noise early in the morning between those two rooms. It sounded like the kids were sitting in our room that's how not sound-proofed the walls were. There was no notepad nor pen in the room. I almost exclusively stay in Hampton Inns and have never not had a notepad and a pen. Usually I would travel with those items anyway but this time I didn't have any paper and needed some. Went down to the front desk to ask for a notepad and the clerk tells me that the whole hotel is out of them and she hands me a few post-it notes. That is either very poor management or a stupid way to save money at a $400/night hotel -- not providing a pen and a pad of paper. Also for $400.00 a night why was there rarely ever a doorman to help with bags and flagging down taxis? That's a NYC hotel standard. But I rarely saw one out there at this hotel. Bottom line...this is a really nice hotel. It is. You should try it out. I just want them to address some of these issues with the room and the other things that made this stay less than excellent.,Atlanta,70,3.0

We asked for a map the evening we checked in and were told we could get one at the Concierge desk at 8 *the next morning*.

I am a former New Yorker who has lived away for many years. Over the years we have visited many times and we have always stayed in five star east side hotels. This time we decided to make things easy on ourselves and stay in the theater district. We chose the HI Times Square Central for location and reviews. What a great decision. This is a terrific hotel. The facilities are excellent, the location is perfect and the staff are extraordinarily kind and helpful. We checked into our 28th floor room away from the elevator as we requested on the app and when we arrived close to 11:00 PM our process was swift and correct. Front desk personnel were charming and a small snack bag was provided. The extra pillows we requested were in our room. The room was small but beautifully furnished. Great bed, desk and chair, a real closet with a safe, ironing board and iron and nice hangers. Well lit bathroom and nice shower. Plenty of towels. Multiple USB charging ports at desk and near the bed. Good lighting in bedroom. Surprisingly quiet with no street noise. The hotel says the rooms are soundproof and ours seemed to be. The only noise we heard were a few voices in the hall for a few moments. Housekeeping was done early in the day and was very nicely completed. Breakfast in the dining area was well done. Hampton Inns have a nice breakfast selection and this was up to the standard. Hot and cold food, eggs cereals, pastries fruit coffee etc. very very nice staff in the breakfast room kept food refreshed and tables bussed cleaned and ready. Considering how busy the hotel was the breakfast experience was really great in large part due to the diligence and friendliness of the crew. Elevator service was fast and generally not overcrowded. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift. There is a small convenience market in the lobby and 24 hr coffee and tea. Because of the excellent location we were able to walk to and from the theater performances. For other things we used Uber. Since the hotel is so centrally located waits were never more than five minutes for car to arrive. Maria and Letitia at the front desk were particularly gracious. Maria emailed us the day of arrival to see if we needed anything special and saw to it everything we asked for was in place. Letitia was always smiling and warm. Overall one could not chose a better hotel for a theater visit. Frankly the service put many five star hotels we have stayed at to shame. These folks really understand customer service and make one welcome and comfortable Thanks to everyone!!",Denver,45,5.0

Despite a long line during the busy Thanksgiving holiday period, the staff efficiently and pleasantly assisted everyone. The elevator-wait felt long as we ended up waiting between 4 to 6 minutes for the handful of times we used them and generally the small elevators got full quickly. The included breakfast service was quite good. It wasn't hard to get a table and vigilant staff ensured that the food stations were well-stocked and the areas clean. Complimentary internet was easy to access and worked well during the entire stay on the 3 devices we connected. The king-bedroom felt quite small. After getting off the elevator onto a very narrow hallway, the room-doors were literally an arm's stretch away. Opening the door you are literally two steps from the bed. Two small nightstands on either side have USB charging plugs. The room carpet also felt cheap quality. A very small closet and a tight bathroom complete the accommodation. The TV had a wider selection of channels than at a typical hotel. Overall, probably commensurate with the price you pay.

Not bad for a busy NY hotel.The location of the hotel is perfect as it is just off of Seventh Ave. which is busy but you can walk West over to Eighth and Ninth where there are a number of restaurants and a wine shop at 594 Eighth Ave that seemed to have reasonable prices even for NY.All in all a very pleasant stay and if and when we return to NYC we will stay there again.","Williamsburg, Virginia",191,4.0

There are facilities for making drinks in the room but this was rarely necessary as there are free hot drinks (tea/coffee/hot choc) available in the lobby all the time - and there are also often fresh cookies!Breakfast was served over several hours to suit everyone.

Was looking to come in for a weekend with friends, and it popped up in a search.The staff couldn't be more professional, and friendly. Above & beyond. In fact, I was so impressed, I went back the very next weekend. That initially appeared problematic, since it was the Columbus Holiday Weekend, Alicia Keys concert, parade, & Comic Convention. Gerry Hughes was able to make it happen for me & friends. The rooms are spacious and immaculate. Even though I prefer to have a mini fridge in my room, I was willing to overlook this since the breakfast was more than adequate, and front desk supplied an endless amount of bottled water. Jonny ( the greeter/ doorman/ baggage storer/ taxi finder, is truly incredible. Along with front desk greeter Maria. What ever they are being paid, ( which I hope is well) tip them any way.

I did miss them offering an omelette station. They did offer coffee and a to-go meal bag which was nice. The room we had was small but comfy and clean and staff were helpful and polite.My only con would have been the fact that our room was not ready and the hotel was busy and they allowed you to leave your bags but they wee literally left on the side of the desk for anyone to touch or take. I waited because I was concerned about my items being taken and was told that bags were fine and would be moved but I watched them sit for at least 15 minutes..again they were busy. I even went into my own bag at least two times and no one ever looked my way or questioned whether it belonged to me. That wouldn't have been so bad if I was the only one there and they could have remembered that particular bag belonged me but the lobby was packed with people checking in and out and standing on top of each other and near tons of luggage that had been left sitting right next too the counter.I politely pushed ours to the bag of the luggage area where someone had to move other bags to get to them and hoped for the best.

The staff here is excellent - very helpful, friendly, and there's a lot of them. The room is a pretty good size, above average clean (bathroom corners could use some attention, however), the windows open, there's enough hot water, the shower works, the toilet flushes properly, the beds are comfy, free coffee in the lobby, the breakfast has more than enough variety - there's enough here to make this a good choice. I booked on Expedia w/ airfare and the price was one of the least expensive.THE BAD: Its a relatively new hotel but the furniture was already marked up. The bathroom door opens directly into the room (when it should have opened into the hallway right by the entry door), they use a barn door that is open at the sides so if you're not staying with family, it could be awkward.

I liked this hotel a lot and would recommend it.

More than one person in the room could use the Wi-Fi at the same time.- There is a free breakfast- The concierge was helpful- The hotel's location is good. It is close to Times Square, the Broadway plays, and the beginning of the hop-on hop-off bus toursThere were a few cons that I'm going to describe but these items do not out weigh the pros. The cons are mainly minor issues. The cons for this hotel are as follows:- The rooms are on the small side but I think most NYC hotel rooms are like this. - The flat sheet on the bed doesn't overlap off the sides of the bed far enough, maybe 3-4 inches. I don't like this because when you turn over or your partner pulls on the sheets a little on their side of the bed, there's not enough of the sheet left on your side of the bed to fully cover you. I've seen this same situation at other hotels so I don't know what the deal is with the sheets. At home my flat king sheet overlaps about 12 inches on each side.- It was a little too dark in the bathroom for putting on make-up. They have lights behind the mirror in the bathroom but it's still too dark. - The breakfast buffet didn't have any English muffins (very minor issue)",Dallas,64,4.0

With that said, if you have lunch and dinner plans, it is fine for grabbing a quick, light bite before heading out. You can also grab a to-go breakfast. Finally, enjoy warm cookies in the evening.The location is good for several train stops and for Times Square.The only real disappointment for me is that the rooftop was locked.

I hope her manager recognizes that she is wonderful with the customers. The breakfast area was swamped and it was difficult to find a seat, but the staff did what they could with what they had.

The sound of sirens, here just a block from Times Square, is deafening, and goes on all through the night. As for the ""free breakfast"" they boast about ... it's appallingly bad! I just don't understand the thinking: a tiny corner in the basement, way too small for the dozens of guests trying to fight their way to the food ... which consists of some canned fruit, some yoghurt pots, a tray of powdered scrambled eggs, some horrific fried pork patties, and a few stodgy and stale pastries ... and they serve it up on plastic plates, with plastic knives and forks! And in the bedrooms they supply only a couple of plastic cups - no glasses in the bathroom. Why? In this day and age of ""green"" thinking - surely that's not environmentally friendly? I paid extra for a ""city view"" room - but even tho it was up on the 29th floor, I could still see only the back of other skyscrapers. (I've included a pic here of the view from my room - judge for yourself if it's worth the extra money...) The view from the ""viewing deck"", two floors up, is no better. Lastly, the morning I left I needed to get to Brooklyn pier: the bellhop told me it was just as cheap to use the limo service he recommended as it would be to call a cab; $70 - so I took his advice. But it turned out, on the way back, the cab fare was only $30 - so another ripoff! This was my first stay at a Hilton, after joining their Honours programme.

I paid over £700 for 2 nights. I had a less-than welcoming check-in - no smiles, a mumbling receptionist, and was sent to the second floor. The elevators took forever (there are only 3 to service 20+ floors - I started just taking the stairs). From my room there was no view. Other than a building and bit of roof. I called down and asked on the off chance if there was a chance of moving to a higher room - no. Everything was fully booked. The room is basic. Big bed but: a stained welcome book, no hotel notepad, no glasses, only paper cups which weren't replaced as I used them. I didn't even have a bathmat the first night. The air con smelled funky and all in all just the basic of basic amenities. Huge TV sure but I wasn't really there to watch tv.  After heading out to meet a friend I returned and called down to ask if they had a corkscrew. After much mumbling I was told to come down to reception as they might have one there. I went down and there were multiple parties checking in. All assigned double rooms higher up than the 2nd floor - I know that it depends on length of stay but the overall service was of 'can't be bothered' so wouldn't be surprised if there were rooms I could have moved to. After being made to wait 5 minutes without acknowledgement - not even a 'I'll be with you in a minute' the guy behind reception just looked up and said: ""it was you who wanted a cork screw? We don't have one.""Next morning for breakfast - paper plates. All in the name of the 'environment'. I don't believe it. Paper plates and plastic forks and a poor selection of food. I ate out the second morning. Every single request of mine was met with disdain. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman travelling alone, or if it's just total complacency of 'hey, we have a hotel in Times Square, we'll fill it and we don't even have to try!'I love travelling, I love trying new hotels. I have a lot of great experiences and it makes me sad that somewhere like this can charge so much and treat customers with such arrogance and indifference. I would absolutely NOT recommend this place. The location is not worth the treatment you get. What’s best is that I know by posting this, the complacency of the hotel will only show itself to shine. There will be a stock response that will say something like this: “ I hope that in the future should your travel plans include New York City that you would reach out to me directly and consider giving us another try. Thank you again for sharing your recent experience.”I did reach out and contact the hotel directly a week ago in the hope that I would get some response.

Personally, I wouldn't stay in Times Square again because I felt it was much too touristy for my liking. That being said, it was an excellent location for subway use and walking to many local attractions. The street its located on is quiet with much less noise than others. John at the concierge desk helped us find a great show to see (Paramour) which was right across the street, though we found out later that we paid about $100 more per ticket than we should have...so beware of the mark up and fees associated with using the concierge and look for a good show app or discount tickets instead. Some of the front desk staff were nice but others refused to smile and seemed annoyed by our questions. They did have a great black car service for $60 to the airport that proved to be much better than a taxi or Uber. We felt very safe and secure in this hotel. If you like small hotels in the middle of a big city, this hotel would be great for you.

The rooms are not spacious but fine, comfortable and very clean and that's all we needed.Our only slight criticism is the Breakfast area on the ground floor can be very busy especially after 7.30 am onwards and is not big enough for the amount of rooms. (Special mention to Geraldine at this point - a lovely warm Irish American welcome awaits all from her at breakfast). The hotel offers a flat rate private car service to JFK for not much more than the flat rate Yellow cab fare you pay coming from JFK, which we thought was good value in the circumstances.One tip is eating out. The further away from Midtown/ Times Square the better value you get. After the local taxes and obligatory tip/ service charge ( which is included most of the time but believe is still optional), a basic lunch can be quite expensive even without alcohol. Just to put in context we found like for like restaurants in somewhere like East Village half or less in price than around Midtown.If you are in New York for a few days or more the get the weekly Metro card for the subways - Currently $32 dollars and you can go anywhere on the system.Finally if you want a relaxing time out from the hustle and bustle, a walk in Central Park is a marvellous experience.","London, United Kingdom",30,4.0

She personally made arrangements for a late check out. We were still late getting back, called ahead to apologize and were told not to worry, they would call valet and our car would arrive by the time we gathered our items and checked out.The rooms/beds were clean and comfy with decent city views.

Not adverse to walking I happily walked up to Central Park approx 20mins at a steady pace.

The room was pretty basic just two beds tv and bathroom, there was no fridge in the room - pretty standard hotel expectation this was a little annoying as we stayed 7 nights and would have been convenient, you can hire a fridge for $20/n...

This was the second time I stayed at this property and my last. The first time was awful but gave it another chance. Mistake! This time was much worse. Let's start with the fact that this hotel looks modern but it's in an old building with paper thin walls and no sound proofing. You can literally here everything in the next room. In my case I was woken by the woman in the next to my room screaming and laughing in Turkish after they returned from a night out. What makes this worse was they sounded so close I thought they were in the hall in front of my door. I called to the front desk several times to ask them to send someone up to quiet the people down so I could sleep. I had a client meeting the next morning and needed sleep. However the young lady that answered the front desk phone (named Nene) seemed to care less but sounding annoyed said she would send the night supervisor up to find out what was going on. 30 minutes went by and the loud laughing and yelling people next door kept it up. Finally had to re-pack all my things and move to another room near the elevator which also kept me up that night when people were getting on and off at my floor. The hotel just doesn't seem to have any sound proofing. As if that wasn't enough, the next morning I was trying to get to my client meeting and was stopped dead in my tracks trying to get one of the tiny elevators to stop on my 6th floor. After 15 solid minutes of watching elevators not stop in my flooring decided to walk down the 6 fights of stairs instead with all my luggage in tow so I wouldn't miss my meeting. Checking out was also a joke as they didn't seem to know how to print a simple receipt and after standing there again forever I finally left to get to my appointment.

There are only 3, and the cleaning staff and crew use these elevators as well. I left my room at 9:22am and I did not get to the lobby until 9:35am. Granted, I was on the 29th floor, but I had to wait about 8 minutes for an elevator. Once on the elevator, it stopped at EVERY SINGLE FLOOR. It was extremely frustrating.

The elevators - ridiculous - from the eigth floor - we waited 20 minutes, even trying to go up to go down. Elevators either passed our floor or did not have enough room for two people, forget luggage. We ended up walking the eight flights carrying luggage.

It was perfectly located, new, clean, provided all our necessities (except for one, which I will mention below) and we were allowed an early check-in and check-out. The free breakfast was also a bonus and so was the 24 hour coffee, tea and water in the front entrance of the hotel. I would have to say two reasons were the reason I couldn't give this hotel a five star rating. First was that there was no fridge in our hotel room. This was our first time without a fridge in our hotel room in ages. I couldn't believe how much I missed not having one. It might not seem like a big deal, but after a whole day of sight seeing or shopping it would've been nice to chill before getting ready for dinner with a nice cold beer or glass of white wine, especially in the summer months. The second reason was a couple hours after checking-out my husband remembered he forgot his pillow in the hotel room. I went to the front desk and asked if he could locate the pillow. He called house keeping and was told by two housekeepers that managed our floor that they could not locate nor did they find a pillow in our room. The front desk personnel was great and thought to call lost and found, but we were not successful in finding the pillow. This was as we were leaving the hotel, after a great time in NYC and it left a bad taste in our mouth. I recommend anyone staying here to please remember to bring all their belongings because there is high chance you won't see them again.

We just wanted a reasonably-priced place, with a reputable brand, at which our family could crash for the night. It was only one night, and we didn't plan to do more than sleep here. And that's about all you can do, as there is minimal space beyond that occupied by the two queen-size beds and desk. The room was reasonably clean. The bathroom looked relatively up-to-date, which is more than I can say for the carpeting. There was an initially musty smell upon first walking into the room, but I have experienced that in many places and it seems to be something you get used to after a while; it is probably at least partially due to the cleaning materials used. The beds were OK, not especially comfortable, but the bedding seemed clean and fresh. The lobby carpet is a bit dirty and doesn't give a great first impression, but the large room in back where the continental breakfast is served is nice.

Kevin at the desk was nice and personable and insisted on getting us our extra linens during our 3:30 a.m. check in, which was nice of him. He said it was no problem because he had a full maid staff on duty during the night--cool! Fast towel service has not been my experience at other hotels and resorts. A maid insisted on running up to the next floor to get a towel that was out of stock on my floor and was back in a flash, which was sweet of her. Another polite young man brought us a fresh bedcover very quickly our first night at 4 a.m.--ours had hair on it. Another young desk gentleman was trying to procure a map of the city at the concierge station after hours but couldn't gain access to one, so he turned on the big screen in the lobby with the map for me in trying to assist, which I appreciated. Hampton seems to have well-mannered people who are well trained in customer service and are people pleasers! :) Rooms not too small to be able to function in as a family, especially in NYC. Pretty roomy closet, big windows, decent storage in bathroom and along window shelf, better shower pressure would be appreciated, bright hallways, clean elevators and lobby. Appreciated the small quiet floors. Loved the bed and pillows! I would just lay and feel what it was like to have such a comfortable mattress.

Our room was impressive; clean enough to satisfy this neat freak and ridiculously large by NYC standards. It easily fit our family of 5 on two queen beds and a very comfortable pull out sofa (I thought that was an oxymoron!). The furniture and decor of the room were quite modern and not all at tired.

My only complaint is that the free breakfast at peak times is like feeding time at the zoo and it is difficult to get in and out quickly when you are in a hurry. I ended up going very early before going to the gym in the mornings to avoid the onslaught. The breakfast itself is nothing exciting but everything is there and certainly plenty of it.

Hotel is just off Times Square on 41st street just down from the corner of 7th Ave. Easy walk to Times Square. We again booked this through Expedia think we got a reasonable deal. Although splitting our trip as we did possible meant we paid a little more for this last three nights. Arrived from Grand Central (from our train journey from New Haven CT) in a yellow taxi – reception was expecting us and check-in was very easy. All of the staff members were friendly and helpful. Note this is a busy/popular hotel but still seems calm. Our room was on the 18th floor (1801) and it was lovely. Exactly what we have come to expect from a Hilton Brand (We are Hilton hhonors members). A king size bed plenty of storage space and a fabulous bathroom with nice toiletries. All was very clean and there were drinks you can make in the room – snacks can be purchased at reception but they provide complimentary hot drinks and water 24hrs a day in reception – you can also get a cookie! If you are brave there is a roof space you can go to look around (Did the top of the rock but this felt...). There is complementary breakfast provided; this is ok. Dining room is not large and gets very busy around 9am but staff cope well and try to keep things flowing.

We booked for the location expecting just to use the room/hotel to ""sleep"" and explore new York from. From walking into the reception area the family (4 adults) where impressed and we where all excited to see the room and everything else the hotel had to offer.. The room was spacious and very clean, a large safe to store valuables in (laptops too, that big). An iron and board neatly stored in the wardrobe and just enough hangers for our clothes. The lifts are a minor glitch and if you are on the very lower floors would be quicker to use the stairs and one of the stairs exit directly into the small canteen. Now the breakfast canteen is exactly what it is, what it isn't is a restaurant so don't be disappointed. It's where you make breakfast, toast, waffles and cereals. Scrambled egg, sausages, bacon and porridge are on offer and is topped up on a regular basis... Now the problem, seating you can find yourself waiting a long time for a seat. We tried different times for breakfast but this was really hit and miss, so if you go in and get some hot food it may be cold by the time you get a seat!! The staff in the canteen where brilliant, friendly and attentive and always had a smile (not false) Teddy and Geraldine this was refreshing. The reception area is superb, seating and the free tea/coffee 24/7 is a real touch. The little shop is priced high so plan ahead but it's convenient! There is a large monitor screen of which is interactive/touch control map of new York once again another great touch. Lastly there is a private taxi firm outside and you can book these from the man outside, beware this is very expensive to JFK $100 was the quote.. We walked up 7th Ave (outside turn right) and you can hail a taxi in seconds and is a fixed price to JFK $70!!

Just one warning for those who are petite wheelchair users like me, the sink is at a standard height which meant: I couldn't brush my teeth, wash my face and hands properly. I informed Carlos (the manager) and he apologised and said that's the standard height in all rooms if not higher. I am lucky enough to have full use of my arms so I was able to adapt. Also the floor gets pretty wet when the shower is used (if the curtain was longer I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem). If you use a wheelchair the bathroom floor can look really dirty when your wheels get wet so ask for more towels if this bothers you to lay on the floor to soak up water when the shower is used.

The hotel is very conveniently located. It's a short walk to many different tourist spots and the subways. Nearby restaurants include Schnipper's quality kitchen, carlo's bakery, and Wolfgang pucks. There is also a McDonald's (yuck) right across the street. Outside noise wasn't too bad. There were much fewer horns honking all night long from what I remember during a visit 20 years ago. The rear of the Aladdin theater is across the street, and we could hear the crowd yelling when the actors came out after the play to sign autographs. Inside noise wasn't a problem. Our room was across from the elevators, but we never heard any hall noise at night. The staff was the friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered. I looked forward to being greeted by Teddy in the breakfast area every morning! She made everyone feel so welcome. What a treasure she is! Breakfast was good. Typical fare. The hot dishes rotated so it's not the same every day. There are freshly baked cookies at the front desk every evening at 5, and hot coffee (or cocoa) is always available. Beds and pillows were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The only complaint I had was with our bathroom door. It was a sliding door on a rail, but pretty much the whole thing was an opaque glass panel. When my roommate got up earlier than I did, the bathroom light lit up the whole room through the glass. Very poor design choice. The rest of our group had a normal door in their room, so if you think this might be a problem, just ask. Would highly recommend!!",,49,5.0

Times Square is abt 5 min walk, port authority terminal, Penn stn., Broadway theatres, cafes, super markets, gentlemen clubs, shopping malls, top attractions, all in walking distance. Check in was quick. They provided earlier check in, which is to be acknowledged. I think this chain of hotels don't provide Bell desk facility. So we managed luggages on our own. Standard Rooms were clean and spacious enough for our family of four with two boys aged 14 and 16 years. Bathrooms were also OK in size. Beds were comfy. The corridors in the floors were bit narrow for easy commutation. Our intent to visit NYC was sightseeing and hence spent least time in the room. Hence, Iam not coming up with any serious concern on rooms. The lobby had a 24 hour counter for complimentary tea, coffee and hot chocolate options. This was wonderful as we were able to sip and enjoy a small doses of choice after our early morning and midnight walks. The wifi was complimentary and was working fine both in the rooms and lobby. There were computer workstations and work tables in the lobby area for guest use, which is complimentary as well. Water bottles in rooms were charged. Hence, we picked up bigger cans in a grocery store nearby. The gentleman in the travel desk was supportive for guiding on local tours and reservations for Broadway shows. The breakfast was overall disappointing. 1. Limited spread and choice, 2. Space constraint, 3. Usage of paper plates and cups under the disguise of Eco preservation. ( but they provided plastic forks, knifes and spoons, which should not have been in true spirit. We don't mind paper plates, if the trumpet blowing for Eco preservation wasn't done. ) Hotel staff were courteous, willing and supportive. Cheers to them.

What I liked most in this Hampton Inn Central is that very prompt and fairly elaborate spread of Break Fast in the morning.Though it looks bit crowded with guests between 8.00 to 8.30 AM, I felt the staff members are very quick and prompt in replenishing the items, when finished. also they have system of packed break fast available at reception counter for the people do not have time to sit in the restaurant. Also I appreciate their system, when I return to hotel in the evening after good hard work, some complimentary cookies and bottle of water is kept at Reception. Though they might be for HH members, but the staff were very liberal and I felt very homely. Bath rooms design is latest and looks clean and neat including the towels.  Only issue I had during my stay here is that my cell phone did not get good reception of signals.","Hyderabad, India",2,5.0

The lobby is really modern and attractive. Our room was not huge, but it was big enough and I have had much smaller rooms in NYC. The bathroom was very modern. You can't beat the location either. Just a block or two from Times Square but on a street that is much quieter than the ones that front Times Square. We stayed on the 29th floor and had a nice view and absolutely no street noise.

Room: It was a last minute trip, so the room was a bit pricey, but was still below the standard price for some other hotels. I was staying on the 27th floor with a city view, which was, although noisy, as expected, very pleasant. The room was not large, but designed very well, so I did not bump into things getting around. The room and the bathroom were very clean. On the down side - the bathroom has a sliding door that does not close all the way, which may create a bit of awkwardness if traveling with a business partner. Otherwise, no complaints about the room: the bedding was clean, the air conditioner worked, and the maid even changed the pillow cases during my 2-night stay. Location: the hotel is situated conveniently on 42 street, a short walk from the port authority terminal, restaurant row and theaters. A subway station is near-by, although I have not used it this time around. We did not have any issues hailing a cab. Staff: The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, too bad I did not get their names. there is 24-7 complimentary coffee station in the lobby - which is great if you are pulling an all-nighter for work. Slight negatives: the elevator - if you are in a rush and don't mind the stairs - taken them. It might take awhile before you get into that elevator, which would most likely be very full and tight. If you are looking to see a show - go to the theater and buy your ticket there. I have dealt with broker fees before (out of laziness) but these were ridiculous. I could have bought another ticket for the fees that I have paid. Overall, it was a surprisingly pleasant experience. Nothing too posh, but just what I needed.","Hartford, Connecticut",8,4.0

I usually just had eggs and bagels, but it would be lovely with more vegetables - maybe roasted veggies or fresh tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers or other toppings.Only other thing that could be better is that the elevators were often full in the morning, so make sure you plan ahead and try to avoid elevators between 9-11.","Stockholm, Sweden",7,4.0

If you like the value of Hampton Inn, as I do, then you can't go wrong with this location, provided that you are looking for a property in this particular area of NYC.The rooms are very clean, if small, here, but the beds are predictably plush, the complimentary breakfast offers the usual wide variety of nutritious items, and the hotel is smack in the middle of Midtown, where rooms can go for several hundred dollars more per night. There are the amenities of Internet access and a fitness room. The Times Square metro station is one block, as is the heart of 42nd Street. The elevators can be a little slow and crowded at peak hours of the day, and it would be nice if the rooms were equipped with mini-fridges. Still, it is on a relatively quiet block of street with the commotion of Times Square just one short block away in either direction. My overall impression is that the hotel offers a nice, safe, and comfortable retreat at the end of a hectic Manhattan day, and is a good value for the price. This is probably the hotel I'll look to first on my next trip to NYC.",,2,4.0

This like-new hotel is an excellent choice for lodging in the heart of the theater district at an affordable price.The rooms were large by Manhattan standards (which would be average anywhere else). The beds were very comfortable. The rooms seemed to be well sound-proofed; couldn't hear much city noise from outside nor the teenage girls in our group in the room next door. One note: the bathroom door is a sliding frosted glass door that faces the room, so there is not much privacy if you find yourself sharing a room with someone who is not an immediate relative.The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet was great and a big hit with our students.We often found a long wait for elevators; it is a large hotel with only three. If you find this frustrating, I would recommend asking for a room on a lower floor so you can use the stairs.Overall, highly recommended.","Vienna, Virginia",97,4.0

It's 31 floors, there are four lifts which reasonably quick. We found ourselves on the tenth...no issues what so ever. The size of the room was large, considering the city and the situation!

Flight was good, but oh! customs...it took us the thick end of 2 hrs, really really ridiculous......there is security and then there is security sheesh!One point I'm sure most people will be aware of the New York Pass, this I think is essential. We paid $199/person for a three day pass....it sounds a lot but you can go in to about eighty venues for free.......including all the ones you want to see.

The Hampton Inn / Times Square Central balances this very well.This new hotel is wedged between the largest bus terminal (Port Authority) in the U.S. and the center of the world (Times Square) however surprisingly kept the noise and activities of the city outside of the hotel. Located on the 15th of 25+ floors, I rarely heard the hustle and bustle of the city during my stay, (with exception to New York's Cleanest, (NYC Sanitation) picking up the garbage. Walls between rooms also appear very solid since I did not hear any neighbors.The main room and bathroom were very clean and nicely designed. The bathroom however did not have any heat lamp or fan so if you take a hot shower, prepare for a Roman Steambath. Some may think the rooms are 'tight' with two beds, but that would come with just about any hotel room in a major city.No issues with the front desk. Cookies and coffee waiting for the taking.Wifi and HD TV worked fine without issues. Room included a safe that could hold a few laptops. Limited closet space since the iron board and safe are located within as well as limited space in the room for your luggage if you have a lot of bags.Breakfast was a typical Hampton fanfare. What makes this typical fanfare a much better breakfast is that it's much less expensive than any other NYC breakfast, (Free).Although the lobby is limited in size they gave that space to the breakfast which I think was the better choice, especially if you have a morning rush of guest.Overall a great option for midtown guest requirements.","Rocky Point, New York",195,4.0

This would not be troublesome but they told us to call for our car 30 minutes ahead of time. We called them 45 minutes ahead - it took them an hour and 15 minutes to get us the car. Meanwhile we are waiting in the frigid lobby. Also the elevators were very slow. The breakfast bar also took place down here. All this means spending a good deal of time in the cold, cold lobby. How bout a revolving door? The front desk staff were wearing coats. At least treat your staff better!",,19,3.0

It's in a very good location just a few blocks from Times Square. The rooms are typical NY - very small. Thankfully I was alone because I think my husband and I would have killed each other if we had to be cramped together in such tight quarters. The furniture and decor is all new and therefore in good shape. However, the sheets and towels could really use a quality upgrade. The sheets were scratchy and rough, low thread count and probably not cotton. The towels were rough and not all that big. I asked for a room on a high floor when I made my reservation online as a Hilton Honors member but they didn't honor my request. There are 31 floors and I was given a room on the 6th floor and was told they were completely booked and there was nothing else available. I had no view :( The elevators were small and got filled quickly so you had to wait awhile for one where you could fit especially during busy times. The gym in the basement was good with high quality equipment and a full set of free weights. Breakfast is your typical Hampton Inn complimentary breakfast.","Calgary, Canada",40,4.0

Excellent staff through out complex always happy to help. Building sways a lot especially if sensitive to movement. Breakfast was ok a variety of different things each day try the waffles. Breakfast time could get a little busy and finding a clean table was hard and the later you leave going to breakfast the chance of missing some dishes if not replaced by staff. Sheets on bed didn't seem to fresh but we didn't ask for a change and air conditioning/heating was noisy when on.

Every staff member was friendly and professional, and the highlight of our hotel experience was meeting Tobo, the bellman. He was warm and welcoming when we arrived. He even recommended that we take a short-cut through McDonald’s (across the street) to get to the theater entrance instead of walking around the block. When we checked out, we saw him again and he remembered my daughter’s name and asked her how she liked Aladdin.

The concierge and staff at breakfast were very friendly and welcoming. Definitely big perks of the hotel. Breakfast was standard for a Hampton Inn, always enjoy it being free but nothing to write home about. The elevators and bed made me reconsider if I would ever stay at the hotel again though. It seemed to take forever to get an elevator regardless of the time and they were very small and crowded non-stop. Elevators would fill up then stop at every floor on the way down from the 25th. Add 10 minutes to travel time just to get to the lobby from your room. I don't mind walking stairs but it's a bit different when you're talking 20+ stories. The bed was also probably the least comfortable I've ever slept on and had a huge crest in the middle of the mattress so if I rolled slightly to the side I was practically falling off.

Firstly the pro's - great location on 41st street between 7th & 8th especially if you want to be near Time Square- Hotel is relatively new and the rooms were clean-0n-site guest laundry- Consierg on site, seem to be helpful, although we did not use.Now the negatives- we arrived by taxi with a large amount of luggage, no valet was around, we loaded bags on the trolley ourselves and pushed them inside, to find that the valets were inside talking to the receptionist. No offer of assistance to help us with the bags was forthcoming.-service whilst it was polite was not overly friendly or engaging - they just seemed to be doing there job, which is very different to the experience we have had at other Hampton Inns were staff have all been friendly and engaging.-breakfast is included in room rate, more staff appear to be needed to keep items refilled and keep the tables clean and to keep on top of mess left in the area where the food is laid out by guests.-the room was small, we had a double room, which was supposed to have 2 double beds in - they were more like the size of 2 king singles and there is no way that 4 people could share that room. No space for suitcases to be laid out, and no fridge in room.So overall a very mixed experience, an ok stay for a couple of days at a reasonable price in a good location, but not up to the normal Hampton standard.","Perth, Australia",46,3.0

Avoid that room like the plague. When the heater hits the set temp, it makes a loud banging noise just before cycling off. So I turned off the heater for the night, but heard two others (one in room below me, one in room next to me). A co-worker was on same floor, other side of building, and had a quiet night. Otherwise, the hotel is brand new, rooms are very nice but small (it's NY, so no surprise). Hotel was crowded and we had no delays with elevators. Breakfast was crowded the first morning, but the food was well stocked and I did find a seat. Second day not too crowded. Typical HI food choices.Great location, not too far of a walk to Javits Center, Times Square and Penn Station. Closest bar we found was across the street at the Hilton. Plenty of good food choices all around.Would I stay again? Sure, but I'd definitely complain earlier and switch room, even in the middle of the night, to avoid the noise.

However, our Check-In did not go smoothly. We arrived at on a red eye 6 am at the airport and had requested an early check in, however because it was the Saturday and the night previously had been sold out our room was not ready when we got to the hotel at 7:30 am. So we checked in our bags at the bell desk and did some shopping and had a meal before my wife got real tired and wanted to just wait for our room at the hotel. She inquired again for check in and was told that there were no rooms available. To make sure the front desk knew she was there, my wife sat near the front desk. During the 2 hour wait she saw at least 2 other parties get their rooms and one guest was even nice enough to say to the attendant gesturing to my wife, ""oh she was here first"" as the attendant proceeded to check him in. We finally were able to get our rooms about 2 pm which was still before the normal check in time of 3 pm but just wondered about the priority for available rooms for early check in. We are diamond members of HHonors and stayed on reward points so I am not sure we were on a lower priority because we were on points. There were some other small problems that have been described in other reviews including slow elevators and small rooms with a very small bathroom vanity. And housekeeping did not refill our amenities such as soap, shampoo, shower gel, lotion, and decaf coffee but corrected with a call. However, the pluses outweighed the negatives and we really enjoyed this hotel. We really enjoyed having a full breakfast every morning and having coffee available 24/7 in the lobby with cookies set out in the evening. The weather was in the 30's so it was nice to arrive and leave the hotel with hot coffee. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and would stay again.

Woke up at 5:00am to go to the gym for a run. Stopped in the lobby for a tea and a newspaper. Looked out the front door and saw a car that looked just like mine. Laughed. Thought nothing of it. Went to the gym. Later on, I came back for breakfast and went to the front desk to get valet to get my car. To which they tell me that my car is out front. Yes. The very same car I saw at 5:00am was still out there at 10:00am. To make among story short, valet pulled our car accidentally AT MIDNIGHT. Instead of bringing the car back to the garage, they let it parked out in front of a narrow Times Square side street for the next 10 hours. Oh...and I paid for valet when checking out. Manager offered to reimburse me for valet. I said what valet? I didn't even use the garage. Regardless, I called corporate Hilton once home and they made it right as they always do.

The included breakfast definitely surpassed my expectations. It was a full hot breakfast, with waffle maker included. It did get VERY crowded since we were there for Christmas and went later in the morning, so there was barely enough room to sit and the actual breakfast line took about 15 minutes to get through (again-waffle maker). I think if the layout was different somehow, or the waffles were freshly made without people having to stand there to make it themselves, it would save a lot of time for the guests and help with the flow of people coming in. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. The room was a bit small, as others have said. But I know this is New York City, and for the price we paid-it was a great deal. The only thing that really was a disappointment was the checking out process. The actual checkout went smoothly but getting our car took about an hour and a half! We were told to call 30 minutes prior to checkout to make sure the Valet gets our car in time for us. We did so, and then went to check out. No car. So we waited another 15 minutes. We then went to the front desk and asked about it and they had to call the Valet and give them all of the info again, so another 45 minutes pass before we get our car!

We requested rooms close together and were given rooms right next door to each other, which made us very happy. The rooms were clean and had plenty of space, comfortable beds, and a very clean bathroom. The rooms are slightly smaller than your typical Hampton Inn room, however, I feel that for being in the heart of Time Square, the size was more than appropriate. The included breakfast was very good. We enjoyed the fresh fruit, eggs, pastries, yogurts, cereals, waffle maker, and more. There is always coffee and tea in the lobby, and most of the time you can grab a freshly baked cookie from the front desk of the lobby. Another nice feature of the breakfast area is that they leave the room unlocked all day and allow guests to bring meals in there to eat. We picked up pizza one evening and ate it in that area which made for a quick, convenient meal for us.Location: there is a subway station almost directly across the street, super convenient for hotel guests. It is on a fairly quiet side street right in between 7 & 8th Avenue, and is VERY close to Time Square. It is a 3 minute walk to Time Square, and a convenient walk to most every theater. We walked to the Imperial Theater for Les Mis in less than 10-15 minutes. There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance - I highly recommend John's Pizza (two locals told us it was the best in NYC and we agreed) and Carmine's (family style Italian) which were both on 44th St, an easy walk from the hotel. If you are ok with a 15-20 minute walk, from the hotel you can get to the Rockefeller Center, Saks 5th Avenue (on 5th Avenue) and Tiffany's. If you want to be near TIme Square, this location is excellent! If you want a prettier part of town, it may not be the hotel for you.The staff was friendly and the hotel was a good value. The only negative I'll mention is one that you may see in other reviews - and that is the elevator issue. There are three elevators in a tall building. If you try to get an elevator at a busy time (between 9 and 10 during breakfast hours) you will wait a while for a ride. If you get up early, this won't be an issue. There is also not a service elevator for employees, so as housekeeping is cleaning rooms, you may have a wait as they use the elevators for their equipment and to get garbage downstairs.Is the elevator issue enough to not stay in this hotel? In my opinion, no. Just know you may need extra time waiting for an elevator during peak time, and enjoy the value and proximity to theaters and Time Square. We would stay here again happily.","Atlanta, GA",18,4.0

So, I wasn't expecting the red carpet at the Hampton Inn, but friendly and efficient service is their trademark - especially amongst the front desk staff. At check-in it was clear that this Hampton Inn was a bit unlike others I've stayed at across the country (and in New York City). When I arrived, there were no guests waiting to check in and two front desk agents - one on the phone, the other away from the desk. The one who walked up to the desk looked directly at me and walked away into the lobby without saying a word to me - to help someone get hot chocolate. It would have been nice if she'd said something like, ""I'll be right back to help you"" or even just ""hello."" She proceeded through the process without: being very friendly, providing wifi info, giving breakfast information or reviewing my rate - which I thought included valet parking. I had reserved a room online, but wasn't sure if they were all the same. She was able to tell me that they were: all the same size, couldn't recommend one over another and that some faced ""this side"" and the others were ""that way."" It would have been nice to have some depth to her answer (like, you can see ______ from these rooms on ____ street or you may want to stay on ____ floor if ____). I had to ask her to check my rate. She confirmed it included parking and proceeded to stare at me as if I should walk away. After asking her what to do with the car, I was glad to be done with checking in and hoped for better going forward. While unpacking the car, I was pleasantly surprised to have an employee come up to take the car keys (the front desk agent asked me to bring them back to her). Finally, a positive experience! We usually stay downtown or near Greenwich Village when in NYC visiting my daughter at NYU, so this was a nice change. It is close to a lot of the lights and action of Time Square, but not too close to the noise. It was an easy walk to Bryant Park, and about 15 minutes walk to Rockefeller Center. Another positive! RECOMMENDATION: There is a long wait for elevators, so if your group is fit enough, stay on a lower floor and take the stairs. Staying on a lower floor with folks who cannot take the stairs may be a mistake since the elevator fills on its way down from the top and many people who were waiting for the elevator on floors 7 and down often had to wait or split their group to descend. The room was a standard double. Not much to say about it other than it had a nice view of the street and a peak at some of the billboards in Times Square. It was on the 19th floor, and if I had known (hello, front desk agent!) how difficult it is to get an elevator in this hotel, I would have choose one on a lower floor to use the stairs. The bathroom was very clean and nicely decorated. It wasn't tiny for me and my two teenagers, but it Bedtime was a bit of a challenge as a fire alarm blared around 1am. It went off for about 10 minutes, stopped and then about 5 minutes later, an intercom voice informed the hotel that it was a false alarm. Not so great, but not the hotels doing. One huge problem: there was no refrigerator. The breakfast area was small relative to the number of guests. It was very crowded and there was nowhere to sit in the seating area adjacent to the food. There were seats in the lobby. The array of food was typical of Hampton Inn and the staff worked hard to keep it stocked, the area clean and to answer guest concerns/respond to their needs. I would definitely give Andre, the young lady working with him, and the team in the kitchen area an excellent rating. I noticed that about 15 minutes after my son and I arrived, a long line for food started to form. RECOMMENDATION: ask the front desk staff what the typical busy times are and plan accordingly and there is a long, pub height table off the lobby that has atleast 10 comfortable stools - eat there instead of the noisy breakfast room. I forgot toothpaste so had to make another trip to the front desk. I had very low expectations, but was surprised to receive a pleasant, friendly greeting. I relayed my very different experience from just 12 hours before and the person, I think her name was Keryll, turned out to be a manager. She apologized for the experience and stated that there would be some retraining in the evening agent's future. She offered 10,000 Hilton Honors points for the bad check-in experience (they haven't appeared on my statement yet). Overall, I am not sure I would return to this location. I've stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Time Square (excellent) and two Marriott properties (Courtyard Chelsea and a Residence Inn Times Square) that have exceeded expectations and delivered amazing service with better and bigger rooms.",Northern Virginia,1,3.0

The price and newness was refreshing. The staff was very pleasant. We stayed on the 27th floor facing the street for the quietness, but the large digital bright screens on the buildings across the street can make it difficult to sleep. I propped up books and a bag to seal out any light on the curtains. Maybe try facing the back of the hotel away from the elevators? The three car elevators were always being used by the many people staying in this 250+ room hotel, including the maid service. Plan to wait at least 5-10 minutes using these small elevators. If you stay below the 10th floor, I might suggest using the stairs as we will do if we stay here again. The breakfast was good, but after 8am, it is too crowded, you wait in line and no where to sit, it's not relaxing at all. But hey, this is New York!

Upon arrival a very friendly lady told us we would get a room away from elevators, perfect! Then we went to the room and it had only one bed, so I left the backpacks on the room and went down to check again. This took around 15 minutes since we had to wait for the 3rd elevator due to queue. Once again on the lobby, the early friendly lady went all serious when I told her I had reserved a double room but got a single one. So she was like ""did you use the bedroom at all?"" hello! I just saw one bed and went out. Anyway, I got the feeling she would have charged for the room even when it was her mistake for giving me a room I did not reserved. She gave me another room, another cards and so we left.We got a room on 20th floor, right in front on the elevator door. I was expecting it to be noisy but I must say the elevator was not a problem.Double Room was good, it was small as all the rooms in NYC but we were able to put our stuff and for 3 ppl it was good. Beds are comfortable. Bathroom was good and functional. Breakfast was average and really crowded (it was thanksgiving weekend)Hotel location is excellent, in the middle of the city and just steps away from subway station were you have 7+ different lines to move which is convenient when you want to wander the city.Even when I did not found this at the website, this hotel has FREE LUGGAGE STORAGE which comes really handy when arriving early and leaving late!!What I did not like about the room: Noise from outside. Staying just around the corner of times square is noisy, and even at floor 20 we heard plenty of street noise. There is a small gap (maybe less than an inch) between the curtain-end and the window base and at bedtime it looks HUGE with all the shinning you get from outside. It would've been nice to make the curtains longer to get a really dark room.",Mexico,26,4.0

We asked for a quieter room on an upper floor and we were given a room on the last floor, nice views and quiet as there were only 4 rooms in total on the last floor. The only problem was the air conditioning system which was way too noisy. The first 2 days it was really hot in NY so we needed air conditioning to be able to sleep at night, but the noise made it almost impossible to sleep, so we turned it off in the middle of the night, but the room became so hot that it was impossible to sleep anyway..Thankfully it cooled down the last 2 nights when we were in NY so we didn't need any air conditioning and we could sleep a bit better than previous nights. The breakfast is ok, not great, but we liked the fact that you have unlimited teas and coffees anytime of day. The best thing about the hotel is the location (that if you like Times Square-which I'm not a massive fan as it's way too crowded for my liking).

Btw, The New York Times, which gave the name to Times Square is now just a two buildings next. The room is pretty large compared to what I so far have experienced in Manhattan and it is equipped with all you need including TV, coffee maker and - most essential - a good bed. The breakfast is included in the price and it is really good, you can even prepare your own fresh waffels, you´ll find vegetables and a good variety. What I - as a european - disliked is that all the dishes are paper and plastic, which get thrown away after usage. Frmom my point of view that gives a cheapfast food image and is not environmental friendly. But that is american...The breakfast room is very crowded in peak times, beeing alone you can find a place, beeing a group of 4 or more it might become really difficult. Nevertheless, the breakfast is a big plus.Another really positive experience was the fitness room which is open 24 hours, large and well equipped.

The theatres are just a few steps away. There's free breakfast and free wifi. Just be reminded to get the breakfast early enough to avoid the huge crowd and to get a table. There's free coffee 24/7 by the lobby. The only downside is the difficulty of getting a cab going to the airport. We were forced to take a private vehicle (through the hotel) that charged us $70 to the LGA. We thought that it's a fixed rate but the driver who is also the car owner even asked for a tip. Some of the front desk staff that I dealt with lack warmth and sincerity in the manner that they talk to guests. If you want to check out late, they charge 50% of the room rate and you get to stay until 4PM only. If you extended your stay by 10 minutes, somebody will come knocking by the door to kick you out.

I think they had tried to clean it with chemicals too, bc my throat became scratchy and aching while waiting for the new room key to be delivered. The second room on 15th floor was clean, quiet and perfect (except for the dresser drawers that were OPEN in the morning). I travel often and never never never use, let alone OPEN, dresser drawers. A little ""oddity"" of open drawers inside of my locked non-joining room, I can deal with... even 3 days before Halloween. The location and staff are too perfect to let a weird thing like that ruin it for me. I walked the .8 miles to/from Penn Station using 7th (since I was using the LIRR), use 8th if using Amtrak. Chain restaurants were very close (but they can be pricier than you expect, from what a local told me). Left too early to see the hotel's breakfast options.","Phoenix, Arizona",4,4.0

We were escorted into the lobby and directed to the front desk. The desk associate, a lady and the other fellow, possibly even a member of management, both greeted us and welcomed us to NYC and they Hampton Inn. Quickly she had us to our room and of know fault of theirs, I went back to the desk and stated the couple in the room next to us was having a bit of a fight, so rather then take a chance, she quickly changed the room to avoid any future nose from the angry couple. She was very apologetic and I told her it was not the hotels fault at all, but she went out of her way to take care of us all the same.Our room was perfect, we controlled the temperature, roomy shower and bathroom, great layout to the room and very functional. The room was so clean I had to ask if the hotel was brand new. All this and we still had the Hampton Complimentary Free Breakfast. The area was busy, but so well staffed and a crew that seems like they have done it so often that by the time we had our food, they had us a table. Great breakfast, great staff and warm smiles and morning greeting, I felt I was back home in South Carolina! It was 4 days and three great night all wrapped up with the perfect place to stay.

Service was friendly, professional and helpful. When we arrived to check-in, the front desk was experiencing computer slowness. She was courteous and informative of the situation, and suggested that we help ourselves to the 24 hour coffee and tea in the lobby while she completed our check-in. Since this hotel is new, nothing to complain about in the room. We stayed on the 21st floor looking out towards the Empire State building (although you can barely see it behind all the other high rises). Although our room was right next to the elevator (shared wall), we didn't hear much noise throughout the night, except for the occasional slamming of the doors by other residents on the floor. Because our room was right next to the elevator, it has a sizable foyer (depth of the elevator), thus I think making it slightly bigger and less claustrophobia than the other rooms (I didn't get to see the other rooms' floor plan). The complimentary breakfast was very convenient and efficient.

The room smelled very clean and the view was satisfactory, not a view of Times Square itself. The room is small, which is also expected because of the city.

Coffee, OJ, Milk, and Apple Juice for beverages. Very filling and it's all-you-care-to-eat. The dining area is spacious.

Tey take their time, and don't make you feel like you're a burden. Kudos!Cons:View - had a city view room, but not really a city view. More industrial. But hey, it's NY with tall buildings.

The location is outstanding as the hotel is almost directly across the street from the Times Square subway station and one-half block from Times Square.

One of the 2 stairwells is a little confusing to figure out how to get out into the lobby (there should be better signage), although getting out to the street in an emergency would not have been a problem (that was marked sufficiently). A little worried about those stairwells also because some of the emergency reflective tape was either coming up or just not applied in what I would say was a consistent manner. Could also use one more elevator (waits could be a little long). But I loved the breakfast setup here compared to other Hampton's I've stayed at. Friendly front desk staff. Front door/concierge staff were all good too (arranged what I needed, patient, etc....). Really great location very near Times Square but just enough off to be quiet.

First I was dismayed to find out that there was no fridge in the room. I drink copious amounts of water and want to be able to purchase it at Duane Ready or wherever and store in my room. This hotel also has no restaurant or bar so, equally, I'd like to bring in wine if I feel like it and have somewhere cold to store it. Fortunately, following an inquiry to the Front Desk, I was told I could have a fridge delivered for a $20 fee.. Not bad and an equitable resolution to my concern.Next, however, I realize that there are only paper cups in the rooms. I requested a water glass only to be told that they have NO glassware in this place? And that even their breakfast juices/hot coffees are served in paper cups?

The air conditioner rattled throughout the night. No sense in complaining about anything because management is far to busy to take care of you.

Here are my observations / experience:The check in: Although I E-Checked in, my room was not ready. With arrival around 2:30 PM and 3:00 PM check in, I was offered another room on the 10th floor of which I reluctantly accepted due to the fact that I have ""lower floor"" listed in my Hilton Honors profileThe Room: I was given the key to was an OCCUPIED room. Upon entering, I saw assorted valuables and jewelry strewn about but no occupant. Had I not been a honest man where I hold integrity and transparency as my watchwords, I would’ve helped myself to all sorts of “goodies” and Hampton Inn would’ve been to blame. Even worse, imagine if the occupant had been a woman or would’ve walked into an embarrassing situation, how does one explain something like this? I returned to the front desk and instead of immediately trying to resolve the issue, the counter representative just tried to justify with her co-worker that the computer reflected the room was “ready.” So I was given a room on the 16th floor..which was even higher. Once I settled into the room, about 30 minutes passed when I received an apologetically-explanatory call. It was then I was offered “another” room on the lower floor. What? You mean there was actually “another” room I could’ve received on a LOWER floor and it had to take an incident to make this happen so you can offer it to me? I was too tired, frustrated, and flustered over the whole thing to repack and move and decided to stick it out in the 16th floor. Although as apologetic she was and wanted to make me “comfortable” the damage had been done. Additional stress: In my attempt to calm down over the whole affair, I decided to pull out a beverage I was saving so as to relax in my room. So out to the ice machine I went. The closest one was on the 17th floor, and wouldn’t you know it? It was broken. I had to get ice from the 22nd floor thanks to the housekeeper who gave me good guidance on where to find ice. And speaking of housekeeping- the next day as i returned from my official duties, when I entered the room, i saw that although the bed was made, my towels nor coffee packs were not replaced. After much embarrassment and inconvenience where ALL of these incidents could’ve been handled in a much better way worthy of the Hilton Modus Operandi, I won’t be doing the Hampton Inn anywhere I go. And being that the nature of these incidents could’ve taken a turn for the worse, I believe that not only apologies would be in order but some restitution would be in order.

Aside from the prime location, the hotel was very clean and modern seeing that it is fairly new. The windows must have been pretty good seeing that I could barley hear the street traffic (was on 15th floor).

We have done a lot of research on hotels in NYC prior to booking and most hotels actually charge breakfast and in room Wi-Fi which I thought was absurd. My husband and I drove from NC and after being lost in Brooklyn at 11 PM at night, we finally checked in at close to midnight. I did not experience the “check-in chaos” that other guest experienced but then with just us in the lobby, it took quite a while for the front desk staff to get us situated. Our room was on the 4th floor with an old ugly office building view, which was fine and the room was really small. However, the room was very modern, clean and my husband actually liked it a lot. It did not have a mini bar/refrigerator. Luckily we brought a cooler with us. The bathroom was very tiny but it was really nice. Now, here comes the interesting part – parking! We opted for self-parking because my husband didn’t feel comfortable for someone else to drive his brand new pick up. The front desk staff provided us the address of the ICON Parking Garage which according to her, it is a 15 minute walk which was not an issue. Also, the parking garage had an agreement with the hotel so has better rate. We put the address in the GPS and drove to the location.. guess what, no parking garage! It was just a door in the building, a regular door for people. However, there was a parking garage 15 feet away but it did not have an “agreement” with the hotel. It was $16/night more expensive. We drove and drove to try to search and still could not find. The other parking garage attendant advised us the address given to us “is not a parking garage” My husband and I were confused and we called the hotel and they insisted the address is right and the hotel staff (a different person) advised us that “he is new and not sure what is what” and suggested that we may want to park closer to the hotel and offered a different parking garage. Then he added that the garage may not be able to accommodate a pick up. That kind of upset us and we decided to park at this garage 15 feet away from the “non-existent garage” We walked for 20 minutes at 1 AM back to our hotel. Mind you, this was our first NYC trip so we’re trying to navigate without getting lost. With no manager to speak to at that hour, I decided to email the management and their corporate office about our experience at 2:30 AM and yes I was pretty upset. I expressed my two cents about the importance of verifying the validity of any piece of information/instruction/direction prior to sharing with your client and guest. The next day while we were out, their management tried to get hold of us to discuss about what happened and hats off to her for trying to make it up to us with every option available to her. Now back to reviewing the rest of the hotel: We woke up to construction noise outside our window but it is no biggie and when it’s time to head downstairs for breakfast, we were glad we stayed on the 4th floor. Like everyone said, the elevators, three of them, took forever and they were tiny. We took the stairs. The breakfast lounge is always full in the morning if you decide to eat after 8:30 AM. The room and seating was just not enough to accommodate the guest of the hotel at full capacity. Long lines to fill your plate and two waffle makers were not really enough. Pretty good variety of food available and I must say it is great for FREE breakfast! You can have the option to grab a to-go box and fill it up to eat in your room. Not every floor has an ice machine. You will need to check your info binder for the location of the ice machine. There were three Mac computers and a printer in the lobby and I thought it was convenient for guests to be able to print tickets that were bought online for shows, entrance fees and cruises. The cellphone signal is pretty spotty in the building. We have AT&T and 90% of the time we had “No Service” and thank goodness for their fast Wi-Fi. Finally, I would recommend this hotel for its value and for its effort in making sure the guest is satisfied. We had a good stay with them and would come back despite the parking blunder.","Charlotte, North Carolina",1,5.0

I didn't know it was brand new and I didn't know it was so conveniently located (they all say they are, but...). Being brand new (they still didn't even have all of the rooms finished), everything was pristine and the rooms are nice size (for Manhattan). There were plenty of places to plug stuff in - yay! Most Hampton Inns have refrigerators and microwaves, though I have not seen them in Manhattan Hampton Inns on previous stays. This one did not have either. I even asked if they could bring one in (most hotels have them upon request and subject to availability), and I was told they didn't have any. On my third day (of 4), I was told they do have them. Grrrr. Anyway, please request that they put them in the rooms, because if enough people request that, it may happen. People were always waiting, sometimes for 5 minutes or more, for one of the 3 elevators (for 300 rooms) but the good news is that on each floor, you could see what floor each of them were at, so it made the waiting not so bad. At least they were moving, etc. Breakfast was very good. The breakfast room is large, but it was crowded when I went most days and it was hard to find a place to sit. There is a community table/bar, and people were friendly, so that was a good option. The staff, especially front desk staff, were all very helpful and each had a great attitude. Overall, my whole stay was an excellent experience! As with most Manhattan hotels, it's not cheap! But go before everyone else discovers it and it gets hard to get into!","Sun Lakes, Arizona",2,5.0

Since this was our first trip there, I wanted it to be special. I had originally planned to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn, since I am a Hilton member, but they did not have the accommodations that I was looking for. So, the reservationist referred us to this Hampton, assuring us that it was in the ""middle"" of Times Square. It's actually on 41st Street, which is one block over....on a pretty dark ally. Upon arriving, we were generously welcomed by the manager. I asked for a room with a city view, and it was a decent view...not the view of Times Square that I had hoped for. The room was EXCEPTIONALLY clean! I honestly don't think I could have found a cleaner room in NYC. The bed was very comfortable, with your choice of pillows. The air conditioner was perfect, and the bathroom was as well. They are not too generous with towels, but I guess that's to be expected. On our first morning there, we slept in. We left our hotel room at 9:30 to get breakfast in the breakfast room. Breakfast ends at 10, so 30 minutes should be plenty, right??? Well, the elevator took at least 10 minutes. When we arrived at breakfast, there was a LONG line. Everyone must sleep in and then want breakfast around 9:30. We stood in the line, which moved very slowly due to the waffle maker. I noticed several people ahead of me looking into the warmers and closing them. They ran out of food!!!! When I asked the worker, she said breakfast is over at 10:00. I explained that I had been waiting in line for the last 20 minutes and was there before 10:00. Her reply was, ""Oh no, I haven't seen a line."" Are you kidding me? So.....to my disappointment, I had to eat a waffle for breakfast. I am not fond of hotel waffle machines. First, I don't like sweets for breakfast, and second, those waffles taste like cardboard. Fast forward to morning number two..... SAME THING, except I was there earlier....long line and no food. I even had a worker come over to me and say, ""I noticed that you're upset. You tend to sleep late, and we will save you a plate if you need us to."" While that was a kind gesture, I explained that it appeared their clientele preferred to eat breakfast around 9:30 and maybe they should extend their breakfast time. We were two of around 75 people that got to breakfast at that time. Needless to say, for the next few mornings, we walked across the street to McDonalds. If you plan to stay here, please don't count on the breakfast. They use that as a selling point to ""save"" you money. Unless you are a very early riser, which most people are not when they stay out late in NYC, then don't count on the breakfast. Please be advised that there is also no concierge to assist you...or at least one that I could find. In asking about Broadway theaters, two different representatives had no idea of the location of Gershwin Theater. When it's your first time in NYC, you need a little assistance.When we checked out, I asked for a copy of our bill. The gentleman at the desk said they email receipts, so I would receive it in the next 24 hours. I did receive it 2 days later, and there was a charge on my account for $53 for valet parking. I didn't even have a car with me. So obviously, they are not careful about room charges. I called one evening to get this charge reversed; I was put on hold 4 times as no manager was there to assist me. Finally, they took my number and said a manager would call me the next morning. I waited until after noon and called back to the hotel. The assistant manager then listened and went to ""investigate"" the charge. She called back and reversed the charge. At no time...check out or on the phone with the manager, did anyone inquire about my satisfaction in my stay. I honestly feel that I should be credited for the breakfast.",Georgia,7,3.0
