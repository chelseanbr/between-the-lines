Room was not cleaned well and leftovers from prior guest remained in bathroom. Poor amenities (none). I was shocked. It was so bad I was more interested in getting out of there than complaining and interacting with staff.,,0,1.0

The location was very central, staff was amazing (thank you Anton, Brock, Rick and Victor) and the room was clean and nicely appointed. Added to this, we were staying there at the beginning of the COVID19 outbreak and their occupancy, like everywhere elses, was low. They were still friendly, helpful and upbeat. My daughter and I were so impressed and felt safe to spend our time there even though it was a scary time to be in the middle of NYC. Even our dinner recommendation was amazing... YUMMMM... and thank you for that Anton! We will be back again another time...",Santa Rosa,1,5.0

At this price range, there typically not great, even the so-called boutique hotels. But the Hyatt in Union Square is outstanding. It's beautiful, clean, efficient, the service is excellent, the breakfast is really good, the rooms while small (it's Manhattan!) are very comfortable and brilliantly designed - in short, it;s my favorite in NYC and will only ever stay there now.","Austin, Texas",0,5.0
