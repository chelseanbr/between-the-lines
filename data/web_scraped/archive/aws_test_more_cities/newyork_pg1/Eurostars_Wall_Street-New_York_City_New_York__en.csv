It’s a good hotel in a great location, a world away from the noise and mess of mid and north Manhattan, with some good bars and restaurants close by.The best thing about the hotel, however, are the staff. All of them we’re incredibly polite and helpful, but I do have to single out one person in particular for praise. I believe the lady’s name was Michel. My wife and I cannot thank her enough for her help. When our pre-booked ride to the airport failed to turn up she got straight on the phone and took no nonsense from the person on the other end, who was insistent that the car had been parked outside for 45 minutes - it had actually gone to the wrong hotel.She even took the license plate number and went outside to flag the car down. To the manager/owner of the hotel, make sure you keep hold of your current employees, particularly Michel. Staff like her are worth their weight in gold to your business.","Newport, Wales, United Kingdom",3,4.0
