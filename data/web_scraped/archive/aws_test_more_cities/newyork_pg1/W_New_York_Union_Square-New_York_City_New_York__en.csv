We were told that it is slated for a make-over. The staff were friendly and the hotel's location is great, with easy access to public transportation. My major problem was the mattress, which seemed to be well used. It was exceedingly soft and provided no support. I developed severe lower back pain after two nights. Avoid staying at this hotel if you have any issues with your back.","New York City, New York",0,3.0

Room was fantastic but room service was too pricey. We had vouchers thankfully. Omelet looked like it was made from only one egg - smallest I have ever seen. We were allowed a late checkout and everyone was cordial.,"Sound Beach, New York",4,4.0

The phone was not working in the room, so I called via my cell phone. Front desk said they would call back and never did. Went down to the front desk in desperation and they refused to help. No apology, just “our order guy is out so too bad for you.” This was the night managers response as well as the morning manager and the check out clerk. It felt like they were all going out of their way to be rude and offer no apology. No concierge level at this Marriott affiliate either. The room was surprisingly nice compared to the dingy hallway and lobby, and they eventually fixed the phone. Frankly, there are MANY hotels in NYC at this price point, so be sure to chose another one.","San Francisco, California",42,1.0
