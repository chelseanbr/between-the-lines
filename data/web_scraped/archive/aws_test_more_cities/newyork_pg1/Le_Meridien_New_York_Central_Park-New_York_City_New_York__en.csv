They were friendly and accomodating. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated and cleanly kept. The rooms were larger (for NYC) than we expected, very modern chic decor. Although all staff was wonderful, we have to praise Sonam who provided exceptional service. If you have any issues or questions about your stay, he's a great resource for any guests. The location is so close to Central Park and really everything else, most definately coming back!",,0,5.0

The front desk welcome, the doorman, the housekeeper, and overall tone of the people in the property was uniquely positive and made the stay feel like home. I haven't seen that with many NY hotels I've used in the past few years. The concierge was especially helpful when I needed to leave early and was unable to return to NYC. He helped pack up my things and ship my luggage to my home, since I wasn't able to return to the city. Chris Carrow was very willing to help in an unusual way, it would have been easy to say ""NO"". He went the extra mile to help me out. This is my first trip adviser review, but it's also the first time that I've had service that deserves a public positive note.",,0,5.0

Sonam remembered me from last stay months ago and made sure that I had the best available room and that all of my needs for the stay were taken care of including taking care of booking me an additional night the next day at the best available rate. Every employee that I came into contact with was terrific but Sonam was amazing and he is the reason that I will choose Le Meridien again when I come back in a few weeks.
