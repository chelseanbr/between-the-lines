The location is very good, the rooms are clean. The hotel is pretty old though, and needs a little renovation. The wall carpet on the main aisles were partially torn for instance. But after all, you don’t visit NY and spend much time in the room right?We payed for parking 250$ for 2 nights. So... You might wanna reconsider.. Also another tip for breakfast.. Right across the street there’s a very good deli.. But if you may also choose to pay 50$ for breakfast.. ","Bucharest, Romania",33,3.0

It is a huge hotel in a great central location in Manhattan and the location is one of the biggest plus points of this hotel. It's in the middle of the city with walk-able distance to business district and many of the famous landmarks near 54th Street and 6th Avenue. The other big plus is the lounge with breakfast and small food items and soft drinks during the day. This time the executive lounge was totally full in particular in morning hours and the service was lousy. The beds are not as comfortable as in a normal Hilton, the room needed a renovation, they charge an outrageous facility fee per night and even an extra fee to store our luggage. The hotel is often so busy that a number of regular service items are lacking. This time it was really dramatic as hundreds of young people were flooding the hotel due to a UN event. Young, engaged people are fine, but elevators, the lounge, open spaces, literally every place was overcrowded.I`m a Hilton Honors Diamond member and a loyal regular guest, but this was not a great experience at all.","Dornach, Switzerland",55,2.0

So pleased with our choice of hotel. Location was perfect - having 4 children and being close to Central Park was great as we started the days by popping to a local Blue Bottle Coffee then for a run in the park! The room was better than I expected - stayed in New York about 14 years ago and I remember although the hotel we stayed in was fantastic the rooms were small. But we had a suite and the 2 rooms really helped give everyone the space we needed. The continental breakfast was good to start the day - always lots of choice & even when it was clearly busy it wasn’t noticeable. This is the only time we really interacted with staff and they were really helpful and friendly. I’d definitely stay here again! ",,0,4.0
