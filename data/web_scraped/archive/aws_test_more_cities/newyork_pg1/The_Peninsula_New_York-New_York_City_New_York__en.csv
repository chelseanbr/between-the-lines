Figures, both political & cultural, played out some of their lives at such hotels, with some there when world-altering events occurred. Rudy Giuliani was to hear about the events of 9/11 while at The Peninsula a good few of us are still familiar with lines of soccer star superstar, George Best, delivered while living at The Savoy.I have visited both a good few times & was lucky enough to be treated to a weekend end at The lPeninsula, when traveling through NYC on a trip from Oxford to Vancouver both ways in September 2002, a year .of commemoration after 9/11. Everything about The Peninsula ie truly wonderful.The location on 5th Ave at 55th signals its singularity.Right in the center of midtown NYC, it is in a prime position for important venues like The Roosevelt Centre & it is also well located for fine dining & good shopping. The bar & lounge is terrific with good service & food & drinks, as is the roof top bar & patio dining .  In fact , there was great service right across the hotel & both my nights at 5/55 were just wonderful. With all which was wonder that weekend, swimming in its roof top pool looking over 5th Ave & 55th street, topped it allI love swimming & have swam almost anywhere at a drop of a hat. Swimming high above NYC in the Peninsula’s pool is one of my favorite swimming experiences in my swimming life, which has stretched out over some 50 years, five continents & 58 counties. It is up there in my in my top five pools around the world.The Peninsula also has a very enlightened “pet” policy, allowing pets to stay with their owners,Our Buddhist dog, Riley P Fuller, was an enthusiastic traveller & bon vivant. The Peninsula was just Riley’s kind off place, as is NYC.In fact, a stay at The Peninsula was on his bucket list.If he were here now, he would’ eagerly be awaiting The Peninsula’s reopening.Posted by S Fuller","Vancouver, Canada",18,5.0

We had a long stay.All the team is great and you immediately have the feeling to be at home. I appreciated the excellence of the breakfast in terms of food but even more the service. In all the departments , from the SPA cleaner to the managers I felt an incredible sense of appartenence for the hotel. Many of them works there since the opening and someone even more, when the hotel had another name. i really appreciated the welcoming of Caroline, the director of the front desk.Thank you Samir, we remember forever your smile and your enthusiasm and we will do a big advertising of the Peninsula NY to all our contacts!","Milan, Italy",37,5.0

Thank you to all of them","London, United Kingdom",2,5.0
