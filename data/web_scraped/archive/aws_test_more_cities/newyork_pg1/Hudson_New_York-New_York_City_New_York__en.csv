I helped her with the check-in, and was immediately struck by how dark the property was as well as her room. There was hardly any closet space and poor lighting inside her room. Since there was social distancing in place, we weren't able to comment on any amenities offered by the hotel. As I mentioned before, it was extremely poorly lit from the lobby to the floor hallways as well as the room. Another problem was the excessive heat in the room. Even though we turned off the fan and lowered the heat in the room, we couldn't turn off the heat from coming into the room. She was supposed to stay until the end of May, but she decided to check out in the beginning of May, because when she returned to the hotel after work to take a shower, while she was washing her hair, and had her eyes closed, she tasted that the water tasted funny, and when she opened her eyes she saw that the water had turned brown! She wasn't really happy with the room, and that was the last straw for her. When she checked out that night, the front desk didn't even ask her why she was checking out so early! All in all, she wouldn't of chose this hotel anyway.","Hartsdale, New York",144,2.0

Yes the rooms are small but that didn't bother us as we barely spent any time in our room other than to sleep during our trip anyway. Check in was quick and easy and the hotel is in a really good location - just a 2 min walk to Central Park and the nearest Subway station and only about a 10-15 min walk to Times Square. The lobby is definitely decorated to a higher standard than the rooms and corridors themselves and we did sometimes have to wait a little bit longer than we would have liked for an elevator but on the whole I think the great location and reasonable price for a central city hotel would make me return to stay here again.,"Northumberland, United Kingdom",4,3.0

The Hotel did not have bar nor restaurant. It had been closed due to ""unforeseen circumstances"". This was not advised prior to checking-in. Recommended to use cafe on side road. Did not pursue that instead opted for Costa for breakfast. Reception not on ground floor, have to use escalator or lift. No porter or help regards luggage. Table and chairs mad for midgets and dark room - not enough lighting in the right place.New York City overview was disappointing, Hop On Hop Off buses dirty and ,if lucky, to find helpful bus driver or locals. Just watch out for bus agents ready to reap you even with prepaid vouchers!!Would not recommend or ever visit NY. Had bad experience overall.",,5,2.0
