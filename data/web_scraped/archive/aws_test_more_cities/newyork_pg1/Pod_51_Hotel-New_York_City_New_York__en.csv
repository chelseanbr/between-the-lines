When her conference was cancelled she decided to make a holiday of the non-refundable trip. So I booked in as well. The room was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. There were lots of good restaurants nearby, subway was easy to get to, and we felt at home and safe in the neighbourhood. The staff were friendly and helpful, and my room was cleaned very well. Finally, there was a $20 shuttle to the Airport - that was really convenient on Friday, as I left.",,0,4.0

The two small tvs and all other outlets did not work at all. Not only were we in the dark during our stay, but the front desk had promised multiple times that they would fix this. The issue was never resolved, and we were actually charged a late checkout fee even though we requested late checkout. The manger at the front desk was mad at us and told us that ""there is no such thing as a late checkout"" even though they advertise this. All in all, we paid more money that we were supposed to stay in a dark hotel with minimal service.",,0,1.0
