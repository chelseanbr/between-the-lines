Itâ€™s also really pleasant for morning jogging. Very professional and friendly front desk. There are many restaurants around the hotel and there is a huge food supermarket. The hotel facilities are a bit old, but still doable. ","St. Catharines, Canada",30,4.0

We were there for Valentine's Day night and wanted to celebrate our engagement there, plus our first date out away from our newborn baby. We loved the room and enjoyed the (way overpriced) drinks at Contour. We were surprised that, for a category 8 with a known name, their in-room dining food was so basic and dull and there were limited options for t.v. (especially no pay per view), so it wasn't very thrilling. But the worst part was our experience with check-out. The night before, I called the front desk for the opportunity for a later check-out and he gave me 2pm and I agreed. So my hubby and I planned our day accordingly to that time to leave. The next morning, I got called twice from the front desk wondering if we were extending our stay, to which I told them about our agreed 2pm check-out. Later, they called me and told me I had to check out in 30min, so we rushed out completely unprepared. If I had known there was no true availability for a later check-out, that would've been fine. The short notice that we needed to be out felt like I was another sheep in a herd that needed to shove out.",,0,3.0
