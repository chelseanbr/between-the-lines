I came across Off Soho by chance and after reading a few reviews, decided to give them a chance. When I first arrived, I disnt know what to expect judging from the exterior, but as soon as I walked in, I really like the vibe. My room was a three room suite with hardwood floor, spacious en suite bathroom, and queen size bed. The room was exceptionally clean, the temperature perfect, and quiet other than the typical street noise. The desk manager Gabe was first rate and took vare of my every need. I will definitely stay with them again!","Ocala, Florida",18,5.0

The room itself was ok- what you would expect from a budget hotel. Everything was clean. However when we went for a walk, we did not feel safe. We ended up cancelling our reservation and moving to another hotel.",Perth,23,3.0

The bedroom was very tight, and we shared a kitchen and bath with another bedroom, and it was not a problem. It is located conveniently to subways, and the pricing is OK, but don't expect anything special unless you upgrade. The beds are very comfortable, and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating. If you want your bedding changed, you need to let the desk know and leave a key - otherwise only just the kitchen and bathroom are cleaned daily, and towels changed out.","Hallandale Beach, Florida",136,3.0
