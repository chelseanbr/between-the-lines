Located right by the Highline, this hotel thrives on being different without being weird or impractical. Great use of space in the room with ample space for luggage and a reasonably sized modern bathroom.Bed is on a slightly raised platform with the mattress then resting on the floor. Those with limited mobility who need the normal clearance between floor and the top of the mattress may not like this. Otherwise great. Got a great price but could be down to time of year (late Feb). Excellent check in staff as well.",vancouver,6,5.0

Unfortunately, I came down with the flu and had to cancel our trip to NYC. It was less than 24 hours notice when I called to cancel. The woman at the front desk who took my phone call, Mia, was so accommodating. She listened to me, wished me well and gave me her manager’s contact. When I reached out to the manger via email, she responded to me immediately and waived our cancellation fee. I am even more excited to stay at the Selina the next time we’re in the city. Thank you again to Mia and Kate for being so helpful and kind.",,0,5.0

Not even 3 star. It is 2 and half star. Under construction - as you enter there was the smell of solvent. I should of turned around then. But I went for the adventure of the americano - No lobby - dust. No restaurant. No place for coffee before 7am. No deli or place for amenities next door or on the street nearby. I didnt see a bar as advertised. So forget it - it isnt there. You are in the NYC trip off experience. There is a ""facility"" charge even if you dont use for wifi and luggage storage. Even tho the wifi is one of those sign in things where you swear to the allegiance of some corporate swank. You cant get a beverage in the hotel except during the breakfast time. So if you get up a 630 you are out of luck. There is no coffee in room. Or nite cap etc...The rooms are like closets. The bed is a mattress on the floor on small platform maybe 4-6 inch off ground- - so getting in and out of bed is a mobility issue- more like stop drop and roll - but i do yoga so i got my downward dog in- . And i mean it is a mattress on the floor - there is no box spring - so there is a bit of the roughing it - dorm life- No place to put your luggage - a squeeze - no hooks to put hand towels in bathroom so on the floor?. the water from my quick 2 min shower flowed into the room. the desk or i mean ""shelf"" for phone and bottle water - is barely room for a mac book pro so leave it at home - they are going more for the airlines tray size -so if you are in ""big"" business this isnt for you. so small there are no drawers for clothes -shelf in closet? that's cool but there isnt room or place to put the suitcase( and i brought a carry on) - the bathroom - lets say shower stall - the sink is so small ( how small - SMALL -) someone with large hands could only put 1 hand in the sink at a time_ there is no rack for a wash cloth or towel to hang nor door to hang on - poor design - one of those designs that the shower glass can see into the room- if you like to groom yourself and make yourself presentable such as makeup or shave or a little fluffing case or toiletries there is a small shelf about the size of a water glass with low lite and even though im tall the towels are high above the toilet - and it was a reach for me- so if you are average size they have a step stool to reach the towels. I kept thinking this place is like the puffy shirt in seinfeld kinda thing minus the laughs and i am a new yorker - also to be cute or designy they dont have a do not disturb sign but rather a black and white signage which god help me at midnite i couldnt recall if white was make up the room or do not disturb - wtf? it is advertised as a family hotel - and well i guess it is for i could hear the family next door fully all night. of course the next morning i complained and it was one of those scenarios where you arent believed and it is my problem - such as being told - well when I go to a hotel i just go to sleep - I pity the staff for having to work there- - there is one small uncomfortable metal chair - but if you have to do an email - etc.. i would work w a phone or ipad or telepathy - the robe was a turn off for it was made out of blue jean- the towels were good. But I have to give credit where credit is due and - I didnt see vermin didnt see puke and didnt see something sticky in a corner. So it could have been worse. And for that I am grateful.",westchester,3,2.0
