Room was well stocked and had great views of the Freedom Tower and 9/11 site. Convenient location to access Midtown from the Subway. While I understood that the there is no restaurant on site, I was not acknowledged in any sense as a Marriott Platinum member. That was the only downside though as the facility was well maintained.","Singapore, Singapore",16,4.0

Evening room service was limited to pre-prepared food which was adequate. My room was small but nicely laid out and extremely comfortable. The hotel has a nice bar with big sofas.","Brighton, United Kingdom",19,4.0

The location is great, close walk to everything in lower Manhattan. Rooms were updated and clean and staff was mostly friendly and courteous. This hotel is modern in both design and amenities. For example, a key is needed to operate the lights as in Europe, the mini bar had condoms (very smart) and there is 1 lobby restroom for everyone. Currently the hotel is going through some exterior and exterior renovations so there is no restaurant in the hotel. The mats in the elevator are changed throughout the day which is a neat touch.
