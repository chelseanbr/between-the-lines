The location is the only thing going for this 'hotel'.The room was cold. The toilet wouldn't flush. The faucet was leaking.The strangest thing was the blood like splatters I found in the bath tub.I was on the top floor, so the blood could be coming from the roof. I couldn't find where the blood was dripping from. They were soon washed away by the leaking faucet, so I have no proof if they were indeed blood or they ever existed.This is a place I would never return.","Boston, Massachusetts",4,1.0

The rooms were clean albiet spartan. This is definitely for those just looking for a clean place to go to sleep after a long day. It is not a hotel filled with amenities and spaciousness in rooms. This is clean bare bones living. Downside is that it is centrally heated and my room was warm. I could of opened the window but with NYC noice it was a debate between which one would keep me up worse. Also the hot water is very very hot, so careful as easy to scald oneself if not careful. Otherwise, go in with your eyes open knowing it is bare bones living. Upside is easy walk to Penn Station and trains to everywhere.","Charlotte, North Carolina",20,3.0

Very central location. Hotel has no lift which is a disadvantage however you'll get over it as you walk losds in Manhattan anyway. Staff at the hotel very polite and helpful. The most impressive staff member helped me to bring my very heavy case down the stairs on his shoulder and I was so very grateful to him for his help. I didn't even ask he offered the help and said that he was only doing his job. Rooms are small but were fine for me. The rooms could do with a coat of paint and some more storage for your clothes. Comfy bed. Shower gels maybe need looking at esp thw lack of howvere more were supplied when I asked for more.,,0,4.0
