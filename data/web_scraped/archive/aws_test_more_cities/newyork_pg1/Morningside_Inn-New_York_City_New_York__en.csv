Yes, it's a budget hotel with pretty basic accommodations but if you're visiting NYC for pleasure and just need a place to crash, this place fills that need. The Upper West Side location can't be beat either, with quick and easy access to the subway and bus lines. Just have realistic expectations of what you're getting (hint, you don't get fancy champagne on a beer budget) and you'll be fine!","New York City, New York",9,4.0

When I arrived, they said they were sold out of rooms with private bathrooms (which is the room that I had a confirmed reservation for). They offered me a room with a shared bathroom or a refund with an attitude as if being sold out is a natural reason not to honor my existing confirmed reservation. There was no apology or reparation. I wrote to management, but received no reply. Unless you do not mind possibly spending a night on the street, do not book this hotel! The person at the reception told me they couldn't help me but that I was free to complain. Overall, the hotel is a dump. Other aspects are just as mismanaged as the reservation system. Rooms, furniture, and toilets are in disrepair (e.g., sign says don't put toilet paper in toilet or it will clog), sheets and floors are stained, the shower walls are yellow with residue that makes you think twice whether you really need a shower. The most astonishing aspect, however, is the staff's complete lack of acknowledgement of responsibility. ""We are sold out"" (of the room you already reserved) seemed like normal business to them. This hotel does not belong in the hospitality business.",Illinois,4,1.0
