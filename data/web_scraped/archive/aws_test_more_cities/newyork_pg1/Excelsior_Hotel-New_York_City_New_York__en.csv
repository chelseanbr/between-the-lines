This is a terrific part of Manhattan....less crowded and much more manageable than busy, overcrowded, pushy Midtown. Terrific restaurants nearby and free coffee, tea and granola bars to indulge in while waiting for your family getting ready in the morning. It's a bit old fashioned...which I appreciate. I certainly will consider staying here again!","Forked River, New Jersey",33,4.0

The front desk managers were very friendly and helpful. The room was big and clean. The bathroom was clean, white, and ample size. The beds were comfortable. We were on the 10th floor and couldnâ€™t hear any noise from inside or outside the hotel. The neighborhood was safe, quiet, and not overly crowded. I look forward to a return trip to the Excelsior Hotel and will never stay anywhere else when in NYC. ",,10,5.0

Very hard to sleep. Furniture a bit dated. Extra facility charge of $21 not on web site (what facility services that were provided is a mystery).,,0,1.0
