The hotel had actually upgraded us from double to king which was nice, but when we saw the room we were a bit disappointed. Alot smaller than the photos look and the windows dont open, we even had a sticker covering the window so we didnt actually have a view at all. Air con from outside was very loud especially during the night but we soon got used to it. Onto the pros, bedding seemed to be changed daily which is a massive bonus but we stayed during the Corona virus outbreak so not sure if they do this normally. Room tidied every day. Rooftop ""bar"" is a complete joke. It's hardly a rooftop at all its tiny and the roof wasnt opened. The rooftop and the downstairs bar both closed during our stay due to Corona virus. Did not get to try the downstairs bar so cannot commend but it looked nice enough. Front desk staff were lovely and friendly. The biggest plus for this hotel is the location-its perfect. Right opposite a shopping centre, star bucks next door one side and subway the other. Few mins walk to central park if that. Right by the subway which is super handy for sight seeing. All in all a nice stay just not as 'swanky' as we were sold and paid for. It was our first time in New York tho so maybe alot of the hotels are like this, small and dingey. We enjoyed our stay and due to location would probably stay here again. NYC was very quiet compared to normal so would love to come back to experience it, once the corona buggers off!!! ",,19,3.0

The room was a very good size for a NYC hotel room. The room was clean and looked nice upon arrival. Our only issues were the hotel room phone didn’t work which was problematic when trying to call and let them k ow the bathroom light had burned out.,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4,4.0

Outstanding customer service! Even with the small issue we had Victor made sure my fiancé and I were beyond satisfied and did all he could to be there every step of the way!!so friendly and easy going I didn’t feel rushed at all. A RAISE IS NEEDED FOR VICTOR AND FRANKLIN. It’s not easy having great customer skills Throughout your entire shift. —we stayed for 2 nights —king suite,,1,5.0
