The location is the only real asset. Rooms are very small, the thermostat could not be controlled. This property was somewhat rundown (although not horrific) and average service. It would be a fine budget hotel at under $100 a night, but not a Marriott, in the largest US city at $300+ a night. ",,1,2.0

The description on Marriott’s site is deceptive, I believe intentionally, to hide that fact. If you would like a soda - and can cram yourself into a crowded closet they call a gift shop, have fun opening the cooler without knocking other “trinkets” they have for sale on the floor. Unlike most Marriotts, they don’t have many Pepsi products - no Mountain Dew. The M club is a bunch of rude employees walking around not being helpful. If you want a soda you’re out of luck - they don’t stock them. I won’t be back. I also wonder if Marriott knows how unappealing this property really is - because it shouldn’t carry the Franchise name. ","Saint Louis Park, Minnesota",7,1.0

Starting at check in the front desk couldn’t seem to locate the reservation. Rooms seemed partially prepared. Soap was missing in one of adjoining rooms.  We had to call for toiletries on the second day. Training seems to be lacking.  Maybe the hotel is always busy so it doesn’t matter how customers are served.,"Honolulu, Hawaii",7,1.0
