All outdated but the price hasnâ€™t changed. Quite tricky as far as benefits are concerned, we had a $300 credit but they quite conveniently forgot to mention that the main bar will not extend any credit given by the hotel what a sham. We stayed for four nights and thought we were using our credits but at checkout found that only $32 was used from our $300. Shameful form a five star establishment. We were booked to come back again on March 07 but we cancelled. Will avoid this particular property of Mandarin. ","Islamabad, Pakistan",106,2.0
