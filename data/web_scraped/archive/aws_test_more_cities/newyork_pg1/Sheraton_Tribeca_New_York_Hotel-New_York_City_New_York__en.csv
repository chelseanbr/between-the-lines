When I posted this on Marriott.com I received an email asking me to contact the hotel. I did but the person who emailed was no longer employed and whoever answered had zero interest in why I'd called. Upon checking my review on Marriott I see that Mia Fowler responded claiming no harm was done because we ate in the lounge. My review noted this wasn't true, we paid to eat out. She also claimed to have put 5,000 points in my Marriott account for our inconvenience but it's coming up on two months and nothing has credited.Advice to property, when you mess up and email a customer asking them to call in, don't blow them off when they do. More advice. When you promised a token amount of points to make up for a larger loss, at least follow through.Not a bad hotel but sloppy management.","Portland, OR, USA",19,3.0

The rooms are very small and for me at least, good for 1 person to relax in comfortably. Most of the time I've gotten rooms facing east or south which means very little to any view but recently I (somehow) got a west facing room which faces towards the Hudson River (although you need to have a higher floor to get the true view). Rooms have been renovated in the last few years with the typical Sheraton standards----clean and comfortable and they usually stock the bathroom with all the amenities you might need.Staff has also gotten better----in the past they were a bit gruff but now are much friendlier and helpful. If you want/get Club access, the Club has terrific views including an outdoor terrace (which is open to anyone staying on the Club floor). The Club is smaller than most and can get very crowded if there are more than 15 people in there. The location is central to SoHo and downtown/FiDi (about a 15 minute easy walk). If coming from JFK, the E train stops right around the block at Canal Street making it easy to get to or depart from. Lots of terrific bars and restaurants in the immediate area and while there are many pricier ones, do look around on the internet as there are many reasonably priced (and fun) places here too.","Los Angeles, California",7,4.0

For us the hotel was perfectly situated. We could walk to the World Trade Center sight, thete's a great deli and coffee shop next door. There are 2 different subway stops, one right around the corner and the other maybe 2 blocks away. There is also a great little Italian restaurant around the corner recommended to us by the concierge.The concierge was amazing. So funny and full of life. He was like watching a show with everyone. The room was nice but it seems the windows aren't double glazed because I have stayed in lots of big cities and this room was by far the noisiest. You heard every noise outside. The room itself was large but weirdly configured. To get into the teeny tiny dark closet you had to move the nightstand to open the door. I needed my flashlight to see inside. In order to see the TV from the bed you needed to lay on your left side as it is directly next to the side of the bed. Our room had a very comfy chair and sofa. There was also a large kitchen table and 4 chairs...weird. I think the whole room needs to be redesigned.The executive lounge was small and very hot with a limited breakfast selection. Not what is expected in an executive lounge. However in the warmer months, this lounge also has a huge outdoor area with amazing views. Again a redesign is needed and a refurb as the furniture is all dirty and stained. Nice touch in the evening is free unlimited booze.The staff are all exemplary. From the minute I arrived everyone was wonderful. Housekeepers, front desk staff, executive lounge staff and especially the concierge.As a lifetime Titanium member I have stayed in lots of Marriott properties. For me it served ir's purpose for a 4 night stay but I don't know that I would want to stay longer. That being said, I am planning on returning January 2021.","Naples, Florida",250,3.0
