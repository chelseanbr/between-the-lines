Megan D. provided top notch service and went above and beyond our expectations! The Moxy definitely has a fun and playful vibe, I loved this combined with the modern and distinct decor all the while being impeccably clean.",,0,5.0

As a native New Yorker, I can honestly say The Moxy’s a true steal for its location and price. It’s near everything downtown (including One World Trade and other attractions) and is only a short subway ride away from the rest of what New York City has to offer. I highly recommend it!",NYC,0,5.0

I am always provided excellent customer service, recommendations, and amenities within the room that make the experience pleasant. Any issues are always dealt with immediately and always professional. One of the many employees there Rachel and another employee there named Rich are very polite every visit and I always look forward to seeing them at the Moxy I look forward to returning soon.",,0,5.0
