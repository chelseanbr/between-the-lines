We were due to stay 5 but unfortunately coronavirus ban hit and had to go home early! Hotel was perfect! We each booked a double room which meant we had plenty of room! Rooms were spotless and cleaned daily! Beds were so comfy!! Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful! Always had a smile for us!!! Location is ideal, just around the corner from the flatiron building! Great bars nearby including the 40/40 club which Beyonce owns! Class spot. Another nice spot is the rooftop bar around the corner from hotel!!! Will definitely stay again!!!!",,1,5.0

They recently renovated so it's even better. My daughter always looks forward to our stay. ,,0,5.0

It’s very basic and had it been more modern I would’ve had a very comfortable stay. The rooms are very dated and are ultimately dirty. For 3 consecutive nights we had a toenail of a different colour each night left on our floor we felt the need to clean the bath as soon as we arrived and there is very limited room if there is 4 people sharing a room with 2 double beds. The breakfast was okay if u could be bothered to wait in the queue to make a waffle otherwise you were left with toast or dry muffins.,"Colchester, United Kingdom",19,3.0
