While the doors on the rooms are thin (not great for light sleepers), comfortable beds and beautiful furniture and architecture make up for it. The lobby truly sets the tone of the hotel with a coffee shop filled with young people and dogs. One of a kind hotel in Chelsea.","Baltimore, Maryland",0,4.0
