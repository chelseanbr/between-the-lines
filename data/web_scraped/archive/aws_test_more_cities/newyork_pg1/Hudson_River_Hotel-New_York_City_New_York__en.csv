But who wants to spend a lot of time in a motel room when you have one of the best cities in the world at your door! There are no fridge or coffee making facilities in the room, but coffee and pastries are set out for breakfast on the ground floor. The staff are very helpful and the building is safe and secure.

Yes the hotel is old but it is clean. Showers are hot and beds are comfortable. Free coffee and pastries in the morning. Rooms are small but who stays in their rooms in NYC except to sleep? Hudson Yards is amazing and just 2 blocks from the hotel. Everything else is within walking distance or accessible by subway. Perfect place to stay If you’re seeing something at Madison Square Garden. If you’re in a hurry all the time don’t stay here. Elevators and housekeeping are very slow. Front desk staff are friendly.","San Diego, California, USA",0,4.0

The sink was clogged on the day we arrived (they did fix this issue). The bed squeaked with every movement, waking me up every time i turned. Hot air was coming through vent even After the heater was turned off. There was not even a bottle of water in the room and when i tried to get water from a vending machine for the price of $3.00, it ate all the money. The in room phone kept giving busy signal every time I tried to call to the concierge or to hotel services. When i finally went downstairs and complained, they smiled nicely and promised to send somebody to fix the problems. I ask how they’re going to fix the issue of the stale smoke smell. So they basically blew me off. I did not get a different room, the sink was very fixed, but the room continued to smell, the bed continues to squeaked every motion. I was in New York for one night to see my daughter who I haven’t seen for two months. It was a very busy day for us and it was the only night we’re going to spend together I did not want to turn it into the night of complaints at the staff. So I chose to stay in this very very sub -optimal room that they call superior. My daughter will be studying in New York for the next 4 years, I will never go back to this hotel. The worst stay ever.","Los Angeles, California",0,1.0
