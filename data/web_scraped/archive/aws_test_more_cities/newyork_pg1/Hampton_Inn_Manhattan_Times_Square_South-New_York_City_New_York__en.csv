I'll get right to the issue I had: the water in the shower and the sink (both Hot and Cold) became scaldingly Hot. I was taking a shower and everything was fine but then the water became too hot. I tried to adjust it but it didn't become cool or cold. Just very hot. And I mean dangerously hot. Ok. Not great but I was able to sponge off the soap and figured I could wash my hair in the sink. Nope. The water coming out of the faucet was also only Hot. No cold. I called Front Desk from the hotel phone. Got connected to an operator named ""Maria"". She said an engineer would be up shortly. Called at 8AM and by 8:30AM, no one had come. So I dressed and went to check out. Front Desk person really didn't seem to take me seriously. Offered zero compensation. But he did say ""Have a nice day."" Very frustrating.","New York City, New York",4,3.0
