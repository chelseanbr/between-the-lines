Although I always arrive early the nearly always have my room ready for me and if not I am sat down with a drink in the cosy lounge and wait for a matter of minutes. Always upgrade me to a lovely large room where I can both work, sleep and chill out in. Started having breakfast downstairs instead of my room! They always find me a little table tucked away so I can read and people watch! And yes as a staunch Englishman from the north they always bring me brown sauce (if you know you know!) Had planned to of been there twice already but current issues prevented me! However I will be back for at least another six times in 2020 and I can't wait.","London, United Kingdom",107,5.0

Location is 2 blocks Fromm Central Park, a few blocks to a show and steps form the best shopping. The service is impeccable and friendly. The staff welcome you upong every return and it feels as if you are coming home from a visit. I would request an interior room- and it will be the quietest room in Manhattan. Rooms are beautifully decorated by Kit Kemp. ","Saint Louis, Missouri",15,5.0

Perfect location being a walk away from all meetings, shops and Central Park. Food is delicious and staff are charming. Rooms are really beautifully done up and spacious which is a rarity for New York. I will be staying again on my next trip, thank you. ","London, United Kingdom",26,5.0
