The view from our room was great, but they need to make some upgrades. I know they are currently working on the bar and restaurant, next they need to work on the rooms.","Portland, OR",56,3.0

I did not like the area as I thought it was rather grubby but as usual New York was wonderful as were it's people.,,59,3.0

On the bed, on the pillow, in the bathroom. It's gross and the room looks so outdated. We checked in around 3am and my friends said it's okay. We will only be here for 3 nights. On the last night, I was complaining to my friends how I couldn't sleep cause I'm itchy every night. My friends said they are too! I just thought I had dry skin. There are bed bugs for sure! We stayed at a different hotel after and no more itch. Also, on the last night, the house keeper knocked on our knock at 8:30am!! I had to tell and said ""NO cleaning!!!"" I was pretty upset at this time. When I checked out, I complained and the lady gave me a look and said you should have said something. I told her "" it's not like anything was going to happen."" If this room is dirty, I can't imagine it'll be clean elsewhere. It's a 4 stars hotel, you should NOT wait for guests to complain how dirty the place is or if there are bed bugs. I will NEVER stay at a Hilton property again and would not recommend to anyone. ","Chino Hills, California",9,1.0
