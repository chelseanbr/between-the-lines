We’ve been to Tokyo many times and we were looking for something different, not in the centre of town. The room was comfy, good size, enough room to keep suitcases out. The bar was nice and reasonably priced. The Koenji neighbourhood is cool and we went to a hotel recommended katsu place for dinner, it was delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall very good. I recommend bringing eyepatches as the exit sign in the room was very bright.","Sydney, Australia",76,4.0

We discovered BnA Hotel Koenji when searching for boutique hotels and loved that the rooms were decorated by artists and that part of the proceeds of the room revenue is donated to artists. We arrived around 2:45 on a Monday and were greeted by someone who may have been a cleaning person who was friendly but wouldn’t let us go to our room because “check-in wasn’t until 3pm.” Didn’t matter that we were 15 minutes from 3pm and no one was in the room, we had to leave and come back. It was pouring with rain and given that there isn’t a typical lobby where we could sit and wait we left feeling a bit weird. When we arrived back later that afternoon we were greeted by a woman who I assume works at the hotel and were shown our room. The art was awesome and we were impressed by the spaciousness and design of the room, and loved the wolf murals. The bathroom is pretty modern and there are tons of usb outlets for all your devices. We were a bit worried about the bar/dj situation in terms of noise but as it was a Monday night it was luckily quiet. It’s a little weird checking out of a hotel with an empty bar but it was pretty seamless. If you have an issue there’s a bell you can ring outside that I think is connected to a cell phone and someone can assist within a few minutes. The Koenji neighborhood is pretty cool, filled with tons of vintage shops and bars. The Koenji JR station is literally a two minute walk from the hotel and you can access Shinjuku and Tokyo station directly from the line at Koenji station. So easy! Overall this is a cool hotel for someone who is looking for more of a local experience in Tokyo while still being able to access more central areas easily and quickly with the nearby JR station.

There are few places in the city (and country) like it. The rooms, live-in pieces of art, leave you inspired and the bar downstairs offers a chance to meet the artists themselves over a beer or two. If you're looking to exchange ideas, connect with fellow creatives and keep up with great events in the neighborhood, definitely check out BnA. Awesome staff who not only takes care of your stay, but adds to your experience in the neighborhood with recommendations, event invitations, introductions and more. Rooms are clean, well-furnished, and very spacious for Toyko with lots of light . Highly recommend the BnA Project - you'll leave as not only a guest, but a friend as well.",,0,5.0
