This was a great room for Tokyo with quite a bit of space. This hotel has rooms for every budget and the cheaper rooms are of course smaller and very much in line with your average Tokyo hotel room. I really enjoyed this location as there were many great places to eat within a comfortable walking distance and while there are love hotels near this location it is a very safe place and I was never uncomfortable walking the streets of Tokyo. All the staff spoke English well and I had no communication issues. All the staff were very helpful and I very much enjoyed my stay.,"Hodgenville, Kentucky",52,5.0

Amazing views, we were on the 16th floor and wouldn't have had it any other way. The room, while small, was accommodating for two. The bathroom was definitely the a really nice feature in the room, definitely used the tub almost every night of our 7 night stay. Price is affordable for Tokyo, but for someone coming from America, it's a considerable shock having to pay per person. We added the daily breakfast buffet, which I looked forward to every morning. A lot of the reviewers on here complain about the selection, but I was more than happy with the Asian options of curry, mackerel, and kimchi (great way to start the day, smelly breath and all!) Unfortunately, by our 5th day, the impending threat of the coronavirus turned the buffet into a standard 3-course, western breakfast, which I was less than interested in (why travel to another country to eat what you're accustomed to??)The hotel is in a very convenient location that may seem far on the map from other spots in Shinjuku, but you won't even notice it with how densely packed everything is and all the lights and sounds. Safety was never a concern for us, besides from some very aggressive taxi drivers who seem as if they're on a mission to hit you. In the mornings, you can see groups of young, drunk kids walking around, but that's about it. Overall, our trip to Tokyo was greatly benefitted from our stay here and we'll consider it again when we return.",,9,4.0

Staffs were really friendly and helpful during check in process. The hotel rooms are quite small but it's understandable since it's hard to find bigger room with similar price in Tokyo. Overall, we really had great stay there!","Sydney, Australia",6,4.0
