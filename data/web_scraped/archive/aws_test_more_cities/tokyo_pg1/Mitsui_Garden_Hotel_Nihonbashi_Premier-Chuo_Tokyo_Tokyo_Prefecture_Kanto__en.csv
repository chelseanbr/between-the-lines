I offered to pay for the early check in and they demanded two and a half times the normal room rent . I came at around 11 30 AM with my team and for only two three hours early check in , I had to pay for two rooms around 53000 yen . This amount is almost three times the tariff available on any of Hotel booking websites . I had no option but to take two rooms on exorbitant tariffs . Very bad experience .",,0,1.0

The staff are all wonderfully polite and helpful, and the hotel is very clean and has a nice bar and restaurant. Unfortunately, my room had no desk to work from, and the TV programming had only one channel in English. Would recommend a global vote brand in lieu of this hotel. ","Raleigh, North Carolina",87,3.0

We booked a triple room which was around 26 sqm which I suppose is a standard sized room. But due to the fact that they needed to squeeze in 3 beds, the room was pretty tight for the 3 of us. Check in was pretty smooth, the receptionist can speak a little bit of English, and even those who don't will try their best to explain things as clear as possible. Room is clean, with sufficient amenities provided. Best thing is that they provide a set of pyjamas for each guest, so for those who is staying longer stays and want to keep the luggage light, you don't need to worry about bringing pyjamas. No bathrobes, but that's not a real problem for us. One thing about the longer stay is that there is no coin operated washing machine/ dryer. So we had to bring sufficient clothes to change for our 9 days there. Hope this can improve in the future.The best thing is the public bath. Although it's ""public"", but if you go at the right hour, there is usually only 3 or 4 other people in the bath at any one time. Also was convenient for us as we didn't need to wait for the use of the room bathroom to take a bath and can just do it at the public bath which has full shower amenities, including lockers. After the bath, one can use the massage chairs for some relaxation. The hotel is directly connected to the train station of Mitsuhoshimae and Shin-Nihombashi. There is no need to come out from the station at all, but the exit is quite hidden and you may easily miss it, so we lugged our luggage up the exit staircase on the first day. Do ask the hotel staff where the exit is, for convenience. There is also a lift that is near the exit that connects to the train station. Very convenient. The station is only 2 stops fro Ginza and Tokyo Station. Very well connected. But if you like to stay in a lively area, this is not it. The streets are practically empty most of the time, espeically after sunset. There are a couple of malls nearby - Coredo, Mitsukoshi, Yuito, but they are selling more of the upmarket stuff. So if you want to have a bit of night time vibrance, you would need to take a train down to the next stops.","Singapore, Singapore",29,4.0
