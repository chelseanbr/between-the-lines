The executive lounge however looked like it was from the 50's. The food was poor. Unimaginative, repetitive and low quality. This is not what I expect from a Marriott property. I am a staunch Marriott supporter, but this one should be rebranded. It is a disservice to Marriott frequent travelers. BTW, it is really an out of the way location unless you need to be in Shinagawa. ","Damascus, Pennsylvania",16,3.0

I have stayed in a few hotels in the Shinagawa area and this hotel in my view is up there with the best of them! Excellent service from all that work at the hotel.The executive room is one of the best I have been in, well laid out and friendly service.The station is a small walk away, but hardly worth taking the free shuttle bus or even getting a taxi. Okay I may have dropped lucky with no rain but itâ€™s a pleasant 10 minute walk away.Excellent grounds to walk around with waterfalls for relaxation.Overall I recommend this hotel when staying in Tokyo.","Leeds, United Kingdom",84,4.0

Overall I believe it is still a good deal. Unfortunately out of their control is the location. It is 15 minute walk to the hotel from Shinagawa station and while there is a shuttle bus it is not always convenient. Obtaining a taxi especially during rush hour or during inclement weather can take up to 30 minutes (I was late for a meeting and had luggage so no alternative (could have used Japan Taxi App).But within control of the hotel is their service. During my 3 day stay my desk table had sticky remnants of food and what I am guessing is soda that was never cleaned. The bathroom floor was also not cleaned. The service while polite and staff trying hard, was not up to standards of a 4 or 5 star hotel in Tokyo - I am guessing because the staff seemed young and inexperienced comparatively. I called for room service but my call to Service Express button went unanswered for 5 minutes.On a positive note, the breakfast is very good with a nice juice station and fresh egg and waffle station. Quality of the breakfast food is better than many local hotels.Overall for the price of the hotel for what you get is a bargain. I would recommend if you are patient, have extra time - basically on vacation but probably not for business.","San Francisco, California",70,3.0
