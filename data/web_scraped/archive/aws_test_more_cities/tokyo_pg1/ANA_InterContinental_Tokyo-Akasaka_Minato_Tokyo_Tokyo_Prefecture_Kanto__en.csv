You can order from a menu even in the longue.Comfortable beds and rooms are alright sized. It is very difficult to find big rooms in Tokyo, so for that, this is a good size. Gym and pools are very good.Short walk from the subway station.Absolutely recommended.",,0,5.0

Its location makes this a good choice for those on business. It has its own subway entrance -- Tameike -- on the Ginza-sen subway line, for fast access to all subways.The hotel is located in the Ark Hills complex of Akasaka/Roppongi, and that includes the beautiful Suntory Hall concert hall; and restaurants on two floors in the neighboring Ark Mori building. The level of service at the hotel is five-star elegant. This is professional hotel management at its highest level. As a result, the hotel is also a popular choice for Japanese weddings: it's a remarkable insight into the culture to watch a young couple in full western wedding attire descend the lighted stairway to the main lobby, to be greeted by family and friends tossing lotus flowers in their path! Dining (and drinking) in the hotel are VERY pricey....drinks in the cocktail bar on the 38th floor (which provides a view of Mt Fuji far in the distance on clear days) averaged over 2,500 [over $20 bucks USD] a pop. The buffet breakfast price was over 3,500 yen a person [over $30 bucks]. But not to worry: there are marvelous French pastry shops nearby -- one in the hotel's lobby or on the plaza of Suntory Hall.We loved the service, the cleanliness and the convenience of this hotel, which maintains super-high standards. A memorable and absolutely enjoyable stay in Tokyo!","Omaha, Nebraska",2,5.0
