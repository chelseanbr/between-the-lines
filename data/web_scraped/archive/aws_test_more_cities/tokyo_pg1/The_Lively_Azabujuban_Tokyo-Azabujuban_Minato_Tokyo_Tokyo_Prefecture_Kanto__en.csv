The trip is supposed to be a trip for my partner’s birthday. Unfortunately due to the virus outbreak, our flight got cancelled and so does our trip. Nonetheless we really appreciate the service provided by the team. They have helped arrange several booking for the birthday celebration and they respond within the day with clear status update. This is so far one of the best I have ever experienced. Very sad that I’m not able to experience the good service in person. I would still like to thank them for the service provided. Hope everyone will stay safe and healthy during this difficult period. Can’t wait to rebook once I can!","Hong Kong, China",5,5.0

The ""Lively"" is new and wonderful. Great signature drinks, nice and spacious with really good service. Best of all is the location, bang in the heart of Azabu Juban. FL 9, cannot comment on the hotel but the Bar has it all - great drinks, nice atmosphere, superior service in a brilliant location.",,48,5.0
