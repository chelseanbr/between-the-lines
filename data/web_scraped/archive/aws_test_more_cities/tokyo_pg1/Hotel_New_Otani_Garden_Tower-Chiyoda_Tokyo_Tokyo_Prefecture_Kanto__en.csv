Nice room though bathroom was very small for a king room. Big hotel ( 1400 rooms ) with beautiful landscape garden. Lots of dining options with more than 20 restaurants to choose from. Great concierge desk if you need help to plan sightseeing and shopping trips. Special mention for chief concierge , Ms Eriko Kawakami who made meticulous arrangement for our trip to Otemba premium outlet mall. That was the highlight for my wife. I would definitely stay at this hotel on my next trip.",,3,4.0

This hotel is HUGE. It comes with its own Japanese garden (with waterfall), shopping mall, spa, supermarket, convenience store, various restaurants, etc. The decoration was old-fashioned, and most of the staying guests were elegant senior couples, so the atmosphere was quite relaxed and cozy. Most of the staff were efficient and polite. The French restaurant was authentic and delicious. The live performance at the night lounge was very comforting and inspiring. The room was clean and comfortable, especially when the air conditioner control did respond to my adjustment.Although there didn't seem many sightseeing spots in the neighborhood, I hardly need to go outside since I can get almost everything I need here. The only thing I wanna complain is that I wasn't able to enjoy the breakfast since I got a plane to catch and had to leave at 6 AM. Other than that everything was satisfying.",Taipei,15,4.0
