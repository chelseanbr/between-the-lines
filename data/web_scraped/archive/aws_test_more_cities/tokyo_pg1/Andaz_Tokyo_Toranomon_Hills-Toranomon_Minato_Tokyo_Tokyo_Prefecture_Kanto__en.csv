Great service with very friendly staff! The views from the room are worth it! The elevator was very pretty and the lobby had a pianist and welcome drink waiting for us. Would recommend to anyone looking to unwind.",,1,5.0

As a Globalist member of Hyatt, I expected better from Andaz Tokyo, but sadly it was the worst experience I've ever had.My wife and I were snacking at the club lounge and decided to dine at the Tavern Bar and Grille Restaurant at the hotel, but upon requesting a seat, the hostess said she had no seats available. Did not even ask me how many people were dining. Looking at the restaurant, there appeared to be plenty of seats, so I confirmed again if there were any available seats, and she again reiterated there were none available.My wife and I went back to our room and decided to order room service. Before we ordered room service, I wanted to try to make a reservation one more time via phone. The hostess answered the phone and she said she had plenty of seats available. I then asked what changed between the 10 minutes between when I asked in person and when I asked over the phone. Given the sequence of events, I relayed my frustration to the both the restaurant assistant manager and the hotel duty manager. They were perfectly polite and apologetic, but given the terrible feeling my wife and had, we elected to leave the hotel immediately. We live in Tokyo, and this was supposed to be a date night.I'm not sure what sort of discrimination we experienced, but we know when discrimination is being directed against us.Not really angry, just really sad and disappointed we got treated that way.","Tokyo, Japan",0,1.0

Staff was fabulous, extremely helpful and efficient. The room was so comfortable. As a world traveller I really enjoyed the bed, sheets, view, spacious shower. This hotel stands out. ",,6,5.0
