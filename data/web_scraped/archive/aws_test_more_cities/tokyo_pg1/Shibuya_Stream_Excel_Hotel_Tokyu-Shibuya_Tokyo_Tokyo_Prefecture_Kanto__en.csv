Which means that if you stay up past that time, you will have a hard time getting to your room! I had a verbal confrontation with the security guards late at night because I was just trying to get into my hotel room and they would not let me! Will never stay here again...",,0,1.0

Next to the brand new mall (Shibuya Stream) and lots of Shibuya’s many ‘attractions’ (food, shopping, Shibuya crossing, Hachiko statue, etc).- Hotel is relatively new.- Room : super clean and cozy. Great amenities.- Bedsets (pillow, duvet, sheets) : one of the best beds & pillows we have ever slept in. Wanted to buy the pillow, but they don’t sell it :(- Breakfast : very good, Japanese style with modern touch, very satisfying.- Torrent Restaurant : great New Year’s eve dinner ! Desserts are fabulous.- Robot ‘hotel attendant’ : very amusing and efficient ! It replaces human for doing small & easy tasks.- Taxi service to the nearest sister hotel (Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel) to reach airport bus was great. Super convenient & super clean taxi !Cons :- Room size : moderately small, but still acceptable, considering this is Tokyo.","Jakarta, Indonesia",28,5.0

The hotel is located in the middle of the busiest streets of Tokyo.Well connected by metro lines, the hotel compound also has 200+ restaurants making the stay complete in itself. The staff is friendly and the rooms have all the amenities needed for a good stay. Few things that can be improved:- In-room dining options can be provided for business travelers who are tired to go out; especially since it gets quite cold outside- vegetarian and vegan menus since the people who come and stay are global travelers- Keeping a microwave and some plates in the room for in-room eating- There was a kitchen on the 13th floor but there were no cooking utensils or guides to use the devices. This made the kitchen unusable for travelers like me. I tried asking the staff who was cleaning there but she did not understand English. - Pick and drop from an airport limousine drop point that can be charged.","Bengaluru, India",32,4.0
