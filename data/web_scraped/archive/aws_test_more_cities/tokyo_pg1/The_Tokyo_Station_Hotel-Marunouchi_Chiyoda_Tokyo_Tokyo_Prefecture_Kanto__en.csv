The location is outstanding making it a very convenient trip from Nartita. Don't hesitate to request ahead of time to be met at your train by staff as navigating the trip from the train to the hotel is challenging for any seasoned traveler. It's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the outstanding service provided by the concierge team. As a guest we were afforded access to the health club onsite for a nominal charge. The facility is luxury as well. Our lunch in the main floor exceeded it's already stellar reputation. The luxury, staff and service made this a highlight of our trip to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Even after checking out and leaving for Kyoto, on the way back through Tokyo Station, staff met us at our train and took our luggage to the Narita Express. Their is no way we could have navigated the train station in time to make our connection. REMEMBER, WE HAD ALREADY CHECKED OUT OF OUR HOTEL A WEEK PRIOR when they contacted us asking what train we were on from Kyoto, to make sure they met us at the train car. They also assisted us in purchasing tickets to Kyoto after we checked out. Just as when we arrived, they carried our luggage and gleefully engaged us in conversation and delivered us to our destination. At this point, I want to make the special effort to acknowledge the lead Chief Concierge Marie Antoinette Mori and one member of her staff, Miyuki Saito. ","Bellevue, Washington",0,5.0

Staffs were quite nice, ideal location, the walk to the front desk from the room is a little pain as the hotel is stretched horizontal to the train station. As a tourist, I asked few questions at the concierge getting around Tokyo and was astonished when asked “don’t you have a cell phone,” as if I should do my own research. Typical of the service targeted for non-Japanese tourist but they could do better. ",Japan,0,3.0

If the walls could talk!!! This hotel was once the offices of the railway station. Check in as smooth a silk and I was guided to my room. Heritage brochure given on arrival and walls full of paintings, prints and photographs of the buildings former life. The hotel has a wonderful selection of restaurants - I chose Camellia for dinner which is a bar / restaurant, which was an excellent choice - sausages and onion rings - delicious with some Japanese whisky. Bar staff speak excellent English which is so for all the hotel. To the Lobby Lounge for a nightcap - not my intention but I heard the harp music being played with such angelic talent my attention was lost in absorbing attraction. If I had known I would have arrived much earlier.Breakfast the following morning - my, what a selection in the Dome. I didn’t know where to start but I went around several times to sample a little of each on offer. I was suitably impressed with this restaurant also. As I was leaving the waiter gave me a cookie and crisp bread to take away as I told him I was taking a train from Tokyo later that morning. This is a hotel that mixes the arts and heritage. It is inspirational for its history. The concierge were helpful though they chose to check museum opening by the internet rather than calling (it being the weekend of the introduction of limitation of opening caused by Covid 19), and hence I was misinformed. Front desk super efficient and looked after my bags until I returned four days later. The only downside of this hotel is the size of some of the rooms - my cupola room was just 30 Sq meters. I understand that the shape and size is dictated much by the nature and shape of the building. Notwithstanding, I didn’t spend too much time in my room so no big issues. The proximity to the station is one very positive element to staying here. All platforms within walking distance.A great hotel and a wonderful experience, especially for rail enthusiasts. I love my stay here!","Singapore, Singapore",532,5.0
