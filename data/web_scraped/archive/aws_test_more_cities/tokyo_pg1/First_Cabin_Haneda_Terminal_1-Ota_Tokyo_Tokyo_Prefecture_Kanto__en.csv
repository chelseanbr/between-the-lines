On the bus trip I found this gem of a place to stay. Very affordable, spoke English, super clean, showers and spa available with your room rental. I couldn't be more happy with my experience. Almost worth the price just to leave your bags somewhere for a few hours. If you get in after all the restaurants close you may still purchase food and even beer in their vending machines. It is set up kind of strange where you get your own cube, and you are only separated from other patrons by a vinyl door, but everyone is very respectful and quiet (I felt bad making noise by zipping up my bag).They provide you with everything neccessary for the shower/spa to include, toothbrush and paste, towels and washcloths, pajamas and slippers. The showers are individual, but the spa and dressing areas are open (like a locker room). This isn't really an issue as everyone keeps to themselves as they're getting ready.Hands down I would stay here again! For ¥6800 you just cant do better. And the best part is it's in the terminal so you don't need to rush to get to the airport.",,1,5.0

It was going to be very expensive to get into Tokyo at 2/2.30am (there are several flights arriving at once) so we chose to book in at First Cabin Haneda as the only way to Tokyo was taxi and then paying full nights accommodation. I found their website a little difficult to book on but an email straight to them sorted a booking immediately. You need to get to Terminal 1 (domestic) after arriving on an international flight but the taxi concierge spoke perfect English and organised the trip for us on the spot. The taxi driver even waited after we rang the after hours bell to ensure we got in okay. Once in we were given keys to immaculately clean ‘pod’ style rooms (men one side of reception, women the other). Rooms were equipped with pyjamas (I’m a size 16 and they fitted comfortably) towels, slippers, tissues, dimmable lights, air conditioning, headphones for TV, toothbrush & paste, hanging space, safe and beautifully clean and crisp white bedding. The shared bathroom is equipped with face cleanser, hair dryers, soap, moisturiser, all in a very clean space with showers and seated areas in front of well lit mirrors. It is a very respectful, quiet area and even though the pods around you are all occupied it is very peaceful and relaxed.You can stay until 10am and there is a lounge with comfortable seating and refreshments if you need to stay longer. There is of course free wifi.We loved the experience as our first taste of Japan and it’s wonderful uniqueness. Highly recommended as a late flight arrival option.","Adelaide, Australia",10,5.0

Do not expect the comfort and/or luxuries of a hotel. This is a capsule hotel in the airport. It is convenient, and that is why we booked it (early flight the next morning). Amenities were fabulous - hair dryers, hair straighteners, hair curlers. Shiseido branded toiletries, and plenty of them. Lots of space to do your hair/makeup. Provided PJs, slippers, towels. Everything you need for a short stay. Staff were helpful and friendly and stored our bigger luggage while we kept our smaller bags with us, which we could lock away in our capsules. Beds were hard but no harder than the other hotels we stayed at in the other Japanese cities. The only downside is the noise. Indeed, as others have mentioned, you can hear everything. Someone near us was snoring most of the night and there is little to no sound barrier. Earplugs are available at the front desk but in the middle of the night the last thing you want to do is trek out there, half asleep. Would stay here again for a night before a flight.","Vancouver, Canada",10,4.0
