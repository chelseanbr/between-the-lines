Loved the amazing city views from our room and the convenient location. The hotel is beautifully designed inside and out. Can’t wait to come back again to try the sushi restaurant and go for another dip in the pool.,"Sunnyvale, California",4,5.0

The high ceiling design is just so beautiful. Checking-in on a Sunday afternoon, the hotel looks like full of people in the lobby lounge having strawberries sweets. It was kind of loud and felt the hotel has become very commercial like other hotels in Japan trying to bring customers in with special promotion. When they first opened, the restaurant and lounge were more quite and relax.Anyhow I checked into my deluxe room. It was very spacious, much nicer than I expected. Very modern style Japanese which I liked. Long lounge chair, king size bed and a big bath tub. Then I went straight to the pool and swam for an hour. The pool was nice as expected. But they didn't have any magazines to read which was disappointed to be in the day bed. The pool was empty which was good for me. I also tried their o-furo (big Japanese bath area) also quite nice.At night, I didn't want to sleep yet so I went down to the bar and this is where the biggest disappointment came in. Although the afternoon crowd was gone, the bar was quite but the bartender wasn't friendly at all. I order a glass of wine, i guess he got pissed off that I didn't like the taste of it and asked for another one. When he was making a cocktail, I said to him that it looks good, he just returned with a bitter smile. A normal person will say what he is making or tried to talk to a customer when she si alone. Then I heard him using language to his colleague that it was not something a customers should hear. Anyhow, i took my wine and left because I didn't feel I was welcomed there. Hotel Amenities: No brand name items but the smell of the products were good.They should put an espresso machine or tea set in the room.

Service is top notch. Not cheap but you get what you pay for - big luxurious room, full facilities, top notch service, excellent staff, and more. Location is not the best for me (I would have preferred it closer to Tokyo station) but it is convenient enough for a 5 star rating. ","Singapore, Singapore",38,5.0
