From the moment we were met at the station by two wonderful staff members to help with our big ski bags we knew we were in for a treat!The hotel is lovely - luxurious rooms, beautifully appointed with wood, leather and gold leaf accents. Spacious and stylish bathrooms with every amenity.The main restaurant on level 7 is spectacular. Great city views and watching the bullet trains pull in and out of Tokyo station is great! Food is beautifully prepared and a great variety of both western and Japanese dishes - perfect for our Family.But what makes this hotel more special than others is the service of the staff. The genuine and caring service of the staff is absolutely beyond what weâ€™ve experienced at any other Five star hotel. Always making sure we have everything we need; giving great tips for restaurants and things to visit....and probably most importantly helping me when I was ill. The staff walked me to the doctor surgery; spoke with the surgery staff in Japanese so they knew what I needed and even showed me were the pharmacy was located. The service was above and beyond and made a real difference when I was feeling unwell. Thank you Four Seasons Tokyo. We will return. ","Melbourne, Australia",21,5.0
