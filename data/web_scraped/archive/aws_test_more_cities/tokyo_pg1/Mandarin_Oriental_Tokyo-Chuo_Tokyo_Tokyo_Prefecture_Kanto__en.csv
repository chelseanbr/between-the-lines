Impeccable service like any other MO. Bath products are made of BV, which is especially easy to use. Clean and tidy room, comfortable bed, very good view from the room. There are two restaurants for breakfast. One is self-help and the other is fixed food. Both restaurants are very nice. There are several Michelin restaurants in Tokyo, so you can eat well at the hotel. The Wenhua Bakery on the first floor is also very good. Cloud cake is said to be very popular. This is definitely my favourite hotel in Tokyo! ",Canada,4,5.0

Although it’s located at the top of what seems like an office, it still has a very good look from the outside. The room and service were superb. The check in went smoothly and we were escorted to the room which was a nice gesture. Outstanding management. Location is perfect and it's right above a metro station.","St. Catharines, Canada",30,5.0

The service was wonderful and the hotel and location were perfect. The breakfast and restaurants were fantastic, we loved the hotel and didn’t want to leave. I highly recommend!","Manhattan Beach, California",12,5.0
