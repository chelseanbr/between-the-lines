I stayed here for 4 nights with my family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Our room was big with a huge changing room/closet/make up room which I felt took up too much space. I would have preferred the extra space in the bedroom. I expected our room to be really luxurious, this being the Peninsula after all, but it was not as luxurious as I had expected. The room was still very nice but just not as nice as the Ritz Carlton or Grand Hyatt both of which I stayed at in Tokyo before. The Peninsula is located in Yurakucho so it was very convenient for shopping, eating and public transit. We spent all of time exploring Tokyo so we didn't use any of the hotel facilities. For the price of the Peninsula, there are other high end hotels available that are more luxurious and so I will choose a different one next time.","Singapore, Singapore",7,4.0

From the moment you pull up to the door there is exceptional service. I was at the Tokyo Peninsula for 1 day on the end of my four month trip around asia and would have stayed longer but the Coronavirus had just shut down all the museums and i started my trip off in Tokyo so only needed one evening there to fly in and out of the city. I had walked by the hotel on my first stay in the city 4 months early and admired it from the outside and its location. Itâ€™s perfectly situated across the gardens and the palace and in the Ginza distract. I checked in and was treated with kindness and warmth. The concierge assisted me in making my dinner reservation for the evening. The front desk staff showed me around my amazing room. It was so luxurious and plush and comfortable. I almost wanted to stay inside the entire day in bed and to take a bath in the insane tub because it was do perfect but with just one day I wanted to explore Ginza and all its stores. When i got back to the room after a long day out the bed was perfectly turned down, slippers out, water out, and the few things I left on the bed when i rushed out where hung up. What a treat!. Also worth noting - the gym was a great place to visit before hitting a long flight in the morning. I cant wait to come back to Tokyo and visit the Peninsula again when I have more time to stay in the city.","New York City, New York",1,5.0

I am ambassador elite with Marriott, so have stayed in my fair share of nice hotels in Asia in particular. This Peninsula is a great property with a super friendly staff. The minute you walk in the lobby to check in the staff gives you their attention and takes care of your needs. The room/suite was quite big for Tokyo, clean, zero smell, and the bed/linens was extremely soft and comfortable. I slept very well. The hotel also managed to secure a reservation for 2 to Jiro's, which is a difficult reservation to get. My friend and I had to cancel due to his having to go back to the USA early, but I revived my part of the reservation and made it to Jiro's. The concierge had plenty of information about what to do in Tokyo, what sights to see, where to go, very helpful people.Overall, a top notch luxury property with first class staff from front desk, to the housekeeping especially, to concierge. Very happy with my stay. Thanks Peninsula Tokyo!",,1,5.0
