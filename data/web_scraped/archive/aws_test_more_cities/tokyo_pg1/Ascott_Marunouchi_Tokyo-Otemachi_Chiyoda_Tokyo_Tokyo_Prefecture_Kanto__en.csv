The self serviced apartment had everything I needed and was a lovely size, bed super comfy and linen gorgeous. I had an issue with not understanding the washing machine but thats to do with my ineptness. The whole building is beautiful and effortlessly run. I loved it and was so close to the office for me. The pool is a saving grace too, its open til 10pm so was good to get a swim in every evening before bed to help with the jet lag.","London, United Kingdom",87,5.0
