Staff very nice, bakery, SPA, shops and swimming pool really good. Great ""no cleaning"" deal, supporting the environment. Spacious room, with great view, Jacuzzi in the bath tub etc. Only prices and table charge for every drink in a sky bar were a disgrace.","County Cork, Ireland",58,5.0

Service was good with staffs being able to provide accurate information. The staffs at reception and health club could communicate in English well. One needs to pay to use the indoor heated pool and onsen. The pool was meant for lap swim and there was lifeguard all the time. The train station was about 10 to 15 mins walk from the hotel. I used the free shuttle bus from hotel to the nearest station too. I might consider returning to the hotel if I am keen to swim and use onsen while in Tokyo. ,"Singapore, Singapore",51,4.0
