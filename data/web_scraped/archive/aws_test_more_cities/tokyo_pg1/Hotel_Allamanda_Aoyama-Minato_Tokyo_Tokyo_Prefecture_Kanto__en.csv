The carpets are all stained quite badly. We had to ask to change rooms. The second one wasn’t any better. The furnishings are old and dated. There are gaps between the outlets and the wall - unfinished and poorly done. The walls are all marked with luggage skid marks. The bathrooms have mold and a rusted roof access panel. Common areas are ok. But one of the saddest hotels I’ve been to in Tokyo and I’ve been to many. Will never stay here again.,,0,1.0

The carpet was light and therefore very stained. The walls were very dirty and bumped . Nothing like the pictures on the website. Lights not working and dressing table mirror stand broken. Not what one would expect from a 5 star boutique hotel,"Perth, Australia",4,1.0

We were not disappointed. We booked two Modern Double Rooms for the five of us. Two adults and two teens and a child. Very spacious. Excellent shower design. We loved it. Nice amenities. Comfortable bed and quiet location. 1 minute walk to the Gaiemae Subway station. It's on the GInza Line and was very convenient. It's a Japanese boutique hotel. We didnt require breakfast, or any facilities in the hotel. We simple needed the room and shower. Concierge Dean Andrew was helpful with restaurant reservations. Taxis didn't know the hotel. Show them the map that comes with the hotel key, and no problems getting to the hotel. Complimentary bottles of water given each day. Housekeeping very attentive. Clean and I like how they observe my preferences. I hate housekeeping that moves everything back to their original spots everyday. Amenities were nice. Level 2 is the main entrance, which is entered from the Stadium street and there is a driveway that you have to turn in and up the ramp to the roundabout of the entrance. Many taxis wouldn't know that entrance. The only complaint I have was , we were on Level 8, and each morning and late at night, I don't know why there are lots of noise thumping, and banging above us. Level 9 is not guest room floor. I am assuming it's from the fitness center and spa that is on level 10. We may return to this hotel in the future if the price is not too expensive. ","Hong Kong, China",343,5.0
