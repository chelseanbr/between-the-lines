The staff could not have been more helpful. The amenities were great. We didn't eat in the restaurants, but had a drink in front of the window facing Tokyo Bay. Incredible views. There is also shopping and restaurants within steps of the hotel. It was clean, quiet and the beds were wonderful. We stayed 2 nights before our trip to Osaka and Kyoto. For a reasonable fee, they shipped our luggage ahead to our next hotel so we could enjoy the bullet train without having to haul luggage about. We would stay here again!","Albuquerque, New Mexico",26,5.0

The hotel itself is situated in a very handy location with the trains just below and a 5 mins walk away. There were also shopping centers filled with restaurants and a convenience store all near the hotel, again 5 or so mins walk away. We managed to see a lot of Tokyo so it was very handy to have the trains so close to the hotel.The room itself was ok sized, we opted for the moderate room. Definitely a great choice as the other rooms are a tad smaller then the one we had, it was spacious enough to hold two large suitcases. The bed was comfy and large enough for 2 people. The bathroom was ok, although needed revamping but was still clean. The toilet was separate to the bathroom, had to move from the bathroom to the toilet but didn't mind. The toilet was clean and Japanese design.The staff at the hotel were uber friendly. We only had one grumpy staff member upon checking in but for the rest of the time there everyone else was so friendly and helpful, when we needed help with directions or general questions.The only thing we struggled with the hotel is room service. At times when we've had a long day exploring and walking we just wanted the treat and luxury of room service. Although we had restaurants nearby, many, sometimes when it was cold we just wanted to stay in our rooms in the evening.Haneda airport is only 30mins train ride away, and only one line from the hotel, we used this both ways when using the hotel. It was very convenient and cost effective as the taxis are expensive and shuttles take a long time as they need to stop at different hotels.As most reviews have said, this hotel is a great location and very convenient with plentiful of restaurants nearby.",,9,4.0

I stayed between December 27, 2019 to January 8th 2020. This opinion was mostly driven by it's location, which is located at a major metro hub, Shimbashi station. Shimbashi station, you can hop on any train and get anywhere in Tokyo. There were multiple local food places around outside the hotel, it was a very convenient location. I found the staff to be helpful and attentive, I had a package delivered to me that didn't have my name on it, but I was able to retrieve from the hotel front desk with no issues. The breakfast at the hotel was great, had a good selection to choose from. The hotel room, I went with a Moderate size room, the room I found was rather big for Japanese standards. Had plenty of room to maneuver my luggage and space to walk around. Housekeeping I found was good, especially in concerns with laundry. The decor for the room is slightly outdated and I feel should be updated. Even though I found the hotel to be great, I will probably not be staying there again for my next visit to Japan. Unfortunately, it seems my room had Bed Bugs, which has soured my opinion. Even worse, it seems I have brought a couple of hitchhikers back to my house as I keep waking up with bite marks. I have already spent about a $1000.00 in dealing with it, I am hopeful because of how early I started dealing with the problem, that I will not have to spend anymore and the pest is dealt with from the latest treatment.",,1,2.0
