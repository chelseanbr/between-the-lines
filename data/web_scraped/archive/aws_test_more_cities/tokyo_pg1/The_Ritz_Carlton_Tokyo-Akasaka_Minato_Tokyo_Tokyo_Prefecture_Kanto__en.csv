Luxurious facilities as expected, especially with the pool and the main lobby area. Staff are really incredible which is consistent with most hotels in Japan. A great way to spend a special couple of days in the city, although book if you're not too busy since you'll enjoy the hotel too much.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",0,5.0

Love the hotel. The common areas, the spectacular views and stunning floral arrangements in the lobby were all next level. The food and service for breakfast was incredible friendly and the food was delicious. The bar service was excellent. So many little extra touches for making a traveller travelling alone feel so comfortable. I highly recommend the hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again. The room was spacious clean and very well appointed. The gym was great as well. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to use the spa but definitely will on my next visit. I spent a lot of time deliberating where to stay and I am delighted with my decision. The location and attached shopping centre with cold rainy weather was a huge plus! If I had to point out one small thing it would be that the room could use a paint refresh. A small concession after such incredible service!!","Montreal, Canada",22,5.0
