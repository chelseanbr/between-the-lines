We just refreshed and ventured out.Must give a mention to the bidet toilets which are common in Japan!,"Banbury, United Kingdom",11,3.0

From outside it looks like nothing special. We go down the escalator we see the reception table but the girl led me to a machine on the side to check-in. I got a room with 2 single beds. No way was a double bed going to fit me and my 6’1 boyfriend which they said fits 2 people so spent a little extra to get 2 beds. Amenities like toothbrush, brush, Q-tips, little extras always go a long way for me. The water pressure of the shower was strong. I love the heated toilet seat and it had a bidet too. They give you night robes as well. The AC was not strong so it felt hot in the room. Good thing I bring my small travel fan.We were on the 11th floor, did not hear street noise but the train outside but it was ok soothing almost. The beds were not too comfortable so it wasn’t good for my bad back. The TV did not give you local TV stations, it only had movies which you had to buy movies. WiFi was almost nonexistent. But overall for a hotel in Shibuya it was pretty good. So many restaurants close to the hotel. Location was the amazing for a first time visitor to Tokyo. The entrance to the Shibuya Station was steps away from the hotel. Stayed for 5 nights and it was very pleasant. 4 stars!","San Francisco, California",38,4.0
