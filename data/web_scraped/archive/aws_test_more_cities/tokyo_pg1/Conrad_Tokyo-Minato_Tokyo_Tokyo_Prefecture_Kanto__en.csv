Our first stay was 2 nights before New Years, so we knew that the hotel would likely be too full to offer such an upgrade. We were correct, but even though we were given a Standard King, which was what we had booked, the soft furnishings and decor of ALL the rooms at this fine property are top-notch, and we were happy to have the time to luxuriate in this wonderful room, with quite a pleasant city view, on our first night in town. (See my other review of the December stay, on this site).I reviewed the hotel after our first stay, because it was so wonderful, I didn't want to wait. Not only is the property stunning, but the location is wonderful too, on a couple main train lines, and near some pleasant, upscale shopping, and the Hamarikyu Garden.Apparently, the staff read my review at that time, and in order to try not to disappoint, offered us an upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the Hamarikyu Garden and Tokyo Bay, on this second stay in January! They always say the true measure of a hotel is its people, and the staff at this hotel indeed made our stay wonderful! They knew we were coming back, and we were greeted with open arms. There is nothing like coming back to a hotel, and being treated like long lost family!Yohei, the Assistant Front Office Manager, came and welcomed us when we checked in, in the executive lounge, and told us the story of how they had seen our previous review, and despite the hotel being very full on this night, wanted to make it a point to see we were looked after, and had reserved a 1 bedroom suite for us. This night was ""coming of age day"" in Japan, when people turning 20 are celebrated, and hotel capacity is usually very full on this night.During the following 24 hours, no less than 6 staff on his team treated us as royalty, and were attentive and kind beyond the call of duty. The whole team is clearly quite proud of their hotel, and were happy to be able to accommodate loyal customers, something we very much appreciated!The one bedroom suite had sweeping views, a walk-through closet, between the living area and bedroom area, a monstrous bathroom with heated floors and separate shower and bath, with the bath having a TV in it, the shower having an overhead rose and a hand shower. I particularly loved the 10x10 Koehler sinks in the bathroom, with HansGrohe Faucets, and am searching for them now for my own home!I personally loved the desk/table in the living area, which was large and great for anyone having to do some work while staying at the hotel. And the sofa was generously deep and very comfortable after a long walk around Tokyo, as was the lounger by the window in the bedroom.The lobby is commanding, and has the most wonderful bar and lounge area, twenty-eight, which on both of our stays, was brimming with happy celebrations, music and laughter, which made for a very cozy atmosphere. You can get extravagant drinks and cute afternoon tea here, with a view and great ambiance.The highlight of the stay (besides the people, who really made the stay fantastic) was the breakfast. As Diamond Members, we were entitled to either the club lounge, or Cerise, the all-day restaurant. Of course, we chose Cerise where, in addition to the buffet options, we were allowed a choice off the made-to-order menu, which was extravagant. We had the omelet lobster fricasse on one occasion, and the croffle on the other (which had truffles... and was YUM).I have been to many of the more upscale hotels in Tokyo during my 9 trips to Tokyo over the past 15 years or so (Marriott Shinagawa, Westin, the other Hiltons), and out of them all, this buffet stood out above all the others for its high-quality, exapnsive buffet choices, as well as its extremely pleasant outlooks and ambiance... and once again, for the people. From chef to server, we were greeted with a smile and attentive service. Even the restaurant manager worked hands on with his staff, and cleared plates and engaged in pleasant chit-chat with us. This is something you don't see at many hotels these days.The Club Lounge offerings too, were pleasant. There were some fantastic wine collections, and the tea time offerings were very yummy cakes, puddings, and chocolates, as well as finger sandwiches.If there were any one thing that let down the hotel, it was that the evening club cocktails were full by the time we arrived, at the starting time, on the dot. We were asked to go back to our room and they would call us when a table opened up. We were told it would likely be around 15 or 20 minutes, but it was about 45 minutes.We were still able to partake of all the cocktail lounge had to offer at our late seating time, though staff were struggling to replace food items and clear tables.I don't blame this on the Conrad, I blame it on the patrons. We also stayed at the Hilton NishiShinjuku and the Hilton Odaiba during this stay, and experienced similar issues.It seems that people who book club rooms take extreme advantage of Hilton's generosity. We saw families of more than 4 people with several children under the age of 10 running around causing havoc. These families would sit around for hours eating free ""dinner"" and annoying other guests... and this was at all the properties. I would suggest tightening up rules around number of guests and duration of stay, at the very least, for Hilton Clubs in general, as a solution to this issue.However, once again, I can't say this was an issue with Conrad Tokyo specifically, it was a general issue with all the Hiltons we stayed at. I have seen it happen in US and China before, but not at previous stays at Hiltons in Japan, so it was sad to see.Aside from that one blip, we were so impressed with the pride all of the staff at Conrad Tokyo, and so grateful for the experience and generosity of providing us a 1 bedroom suite on this occasion.They say that great staff is supported by great managers. Clearly from the GM all the way down through management takes great pride in their work, and so do all of the people they support.We are looking forward to coming back for another pleasant stay when the world opens up again! The next time we hope to stay long enough to try out some of the other restaurants such as China Blue and Kazahana. I think we'll probably also try the Conrad Osaka on the next trip too!In all the stays I've had at upscale hotels in my lifetime, this may not have been THE most upscale (though it was right up there), but it did have some of the best quality offerings, and was my personal favorite of them all!Thanks once again, for a very upscale stay, but also for treating us as family!","Vallejo, California",122,5.0

The suites are large and well appointed. The gym and yoga room are great and there’s a first class pool. Are they at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo level? I think very close with staff effort, especially recognising longer staying guests, and the gym and pool is something the MO doesn’t have. Breakfast was also very good, not as good as the MO yet though. ","Sydney, Australia",26,5.0
