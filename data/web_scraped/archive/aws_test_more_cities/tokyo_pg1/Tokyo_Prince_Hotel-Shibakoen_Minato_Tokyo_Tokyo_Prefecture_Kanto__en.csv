Room was large with enormous and comfortable bed. Came for grandson's 1st birthday, who lives in Tokyo with our daughter and husband. In the main we were largely unaware of costs, so bring loads of money. Prices in the hotel are eye watering, £7.50 for a coffee, £10 for a half glass of local beer, £25 for a buffet breakfast, £40+ for dinner (all pp). Perhaps I should have researched more but reviews were on the whole good. Unfortunately we are in a commercial neighbourhood and alternatives to the hotel are not really viable.",,0,3.0

They official check in time is 2pm but I would be out. So despite having rooms available they Want you to pay like 50$ more to use the room 1hr earlier . ( apparently 1 pm Is doable for free) I said only if u hv a free room and its done up already can I just leave my stuff and go out ? A firm no with that attitude was the answer .I’m leaving at 6 am in the morning . Isn’t that an early check out ? So can’t u accomadate my early check in?!?Staff seem stressed and used to giving that passive aggressive “can I help you “ kind of talk . I’ve seen them talking to other guests . For a 4 star hotel they hv a 2 star hotel attitude.,"Singapore, Singapore",23,2.0
