The room is big and service is excellent. Hotel is next to Roppongi Hills shopping mall. Although there is a mall entrance to the hotel, it is a long walk and not so obvious. Subway is conveniently close to the hotel so it is easy to explore Tokyo. Price is not cheap but this is a good choice","Singapore, Singapore",7,5.0

Highly recommend this hotel if you want 10/10 service, cleanliness, quality of service & great rooms","Whangaparaoa, New Zealand",9,5.0

The rooms are spacious, great amenities, and staff incredibly hospitable as expected for the class of hotel. My personal favorite is the luxurious bathroom, modern Japanese with a deep tub that fills so quickly (with bath salts!) and rainforest shower in the bath room, and separate high end Toto toilet. Super high pressure water.If you look enough ahead of time, rooms may be available at lower rates and even better value. Beds may be a little hard for some, though still some of the most comfortable and best night sleep of Japanese hotels.","San Francisco, California, United States",2,5.0
