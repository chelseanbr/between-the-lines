It was, we thought, a luxurious and special place. We stayed eight nights in total, before and after a railway trip out of Tokyo. The public areas were spacious, elegant and distinctively decorated; our favourite was the superb Momiji Lounge with its views of the hotel's impressive garden. Breakfast in the Momiji was always a treat. The Japanese restaurant and the Club Lounge were also beautiful places. Our two rooms were less distinctive, but they could not be faulted: attractive, comfortable, convenient and wonderfully warm during a period of chilly, rainy weather. All the staff with whom we had contact, without exception, were excellent: so courteous and helpful. We were especially appreciative of the porters and bell staff -- they went out of their way to help -- and the perfect housekeeping service. The hotel's location was superb, close to Shinagawa Station, and there was a frequent shuttle service up the hill to the hotel. We would love to stay here again -- it really was a memorable stay.",Canberra,121,5.0

The first room they put us in was small, and needed to be renovated. We asked for an upgrade for the next two nights, which was given to us at the price of 2000 yen per night, which was reasonable. The upgraded rooms, while better than the first one, needed refurbishment and some cleaning. The carpets in the hallways leading to the rooms definitely need replacement. We stayed on the 3rd, 8th, and 9th floors. This is a consistent need in the corridors. The breakfast buffet is very good. Nice selection of choices, both western and Japanese. The coffee was excellent. The staff in the restaurant were accommodating and pleasant.When we checked out for the second time (we stayed two different times), the hotel staff charged us for a late check out (9000 yen), even though we had an itinerary that stated we had paid for a ‘guaranteed late checkout’. This was something we debated with the check in staff person and the manager, and we believed it was all taken care of. Upon check out, however, they charged us the 9000 yen. Had we known that, we would have checked out on time, and left our luggage with the bell desk. It seemed like a ‘bait and switch’ to us.The location of the hotel is very convenient to the Shinagawa station. There are several other hotels in the near vicinity. If we go back to Tokyo, we will look at other options to the Grand Prince shin Takanawa.","Eagan, Minnesota",2,2.0

We had two separate stays in a week - before and after our trip to Kyoto. The first time our room was on the 12th floor, good view and renovated and we were very happy with it. The second time we were on the 3rd floor and the room was considerably more dated and configuration was odd - no drawers, closet didn’t have doors. But otherwise room was spotless, beds comfortable. Bathroom had big tub, good water pressure and scented bath salts, hair brush, shower scrub towel, razor, toothbrush and toiletries provided. No body lotion. Room had thermal water kettle, tea bags and instant coffee, complimentary water bottles. We booked with the breakfast buffet which was pricey but excellent for both western and Japanese options. There’s a 7-11 downstairs which is very convenient. The hotel was fairly empty when we stayed no doubt because of the coronavirus and all the staff had masks. Not sure how crowded it gets normally. Overall would stay again but try to get a renovated room. ","Reykjavik, Iceland",14,4.0
