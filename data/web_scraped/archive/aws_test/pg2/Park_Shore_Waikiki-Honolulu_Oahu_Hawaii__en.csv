Renovations to lobby and pool area are nice. Front of hotel is also nice and has stores and restaurants adjacent to and in the actual property. Like most properties in Waikiki, they charge a resort fee and have a valet charge that is quite high. The hotel is a good deal if you want to be right on the beach or close to the zoo and Diamond head. If not, I would spend a little bit more and stay at the other end of Waikiki. Valet staff were friendly and helpful. Rest of staff was just okay. They were still semi-friendly, but not above and beyond like you’re used to in Hawaii. (No issues though)Air conditioning worked well and bathroom was okay size. ","Winnipeg, Canada",21,4.0

Lobby was under renovations still in January; this did not affect our night at all. Luggage hold available the next day as well as free beach towel and floaters for the beach which is directly across the street. 10/10 location. We came in before our Norwegian cruise and got to explore Waikiki before embarking. Staff was super friendly with great suggestions. Rooms could use updating but the pros vastly outweigh this. I don’tThink I’d stay anywhere else!,,3,5.0
