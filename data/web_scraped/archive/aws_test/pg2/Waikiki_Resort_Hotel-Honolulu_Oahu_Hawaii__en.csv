It is centrally located in Waikiki and only a half block walk from the beach. The room was clean, we had a partial view of the beach, the breakfast was good and the staff all very friendly and helpful. In addition it was well priced and for us offered excellent value for money.","Canberra, Australia",2,4.0

Room was big a bit old but clean and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was just next level,a lot of choices and beautifully cooked, it was the best thing about this hotel that and the location. Location was awesome you are 50 meters from beach and almost in the middle of everything. Can not wait to come back!","Leppington, Australia",0,5.0

The rooms were kept clean and there were plenty of hand sanitisers available due to the coronavirus. The breakfast could have varied a bit more but is was still value for money but they never got my wide gluten free bread despite being asked on day 1 of our visit.,"Perth, Australia",10,4.0
