Clean room, pool, hotel and courteous service. No frills such as room service, restaurant, bar, snack/convenience store, but the room has everything you need. Walking distance from beach, shopping and night life. If you’re wanting to explore and experience Oahu versus a hotel, this is the place to stay.","Minneapolis, Minnesota",0,5.0

It was perfect match for us. It is not a fancy new hotel , however, price is very reasonable, location is great, five minutes walk to Duke Waikiki and all the shops, room is clean and well maintained, full kitchen, and free parking! I think it’s one of few if any hotels in that area which offers free parking . It works on first come first serve basis, however we never had a problem to find a spot. We enjoyed pool and sauna after long day around the island. Hotel personnel was very nice and friendly. We had cleaning service daily, and they did a good job, although we are not that messy. The only thing, that we were not able to get , is a higher floor with better view. But it was’t available for studio room that we booked. Not a big deal anyway, we spend mostly of the time out.I would definitely recommend it !","Los Angeles, California",1,5.0

Parking is first come first served and could possibly be very busy at peak times - although we had no problem and managed a space each day.Only 10 minute walk from shops, restaurants and beach.Our studio was spacious, comfortable with a fully fitted kitchen and a balcony.very friendly welcoming staff. Excellent value for money - although we think we got the best value by booking directly online with the hotel. Even the response to the booking was very friendly and welcoming - a good start!Would definitely return to the Ilima.","Ayr, United Kingdom",62,5.0
