I booked on Hotwire and it only cost $97, but then they rob you when you get there with a $32 per night amenity fee. When I asked the lady at check in what amenities I get for my $32 she was speechless, then she said ""beach towels"" . Haha, beach towels that are old, stained, thin, thread bare, small and probably cost them $2 a piece when they bought them in bulk. YOU CAN DO WAY BETTER","Paia, Hawaii",11,2.0

Large balcony, not much of a view but if you want to sit outside.If on a budget not a bad choice but you get what you pay for, We did not feel it was worth the $200 CAD per night, especially having to pay the Resort Amenity Fee ($32.19 USD per night), thankfully we only spent two nights there",Alberta,4,2.0

Check in was easy and fast. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. They were very accommodating and always checked on us to make sure everything was Good. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to others.,,0,5.0
