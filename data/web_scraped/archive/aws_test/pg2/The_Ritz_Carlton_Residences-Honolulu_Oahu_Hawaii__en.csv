My spouse and I enjoyed a relaxing 3 night stay before traveling to NZ & AS. We were greeted by smiling & friendly staff who were so helpful and welcoming. Our 1BR/1B condo was modern and comfy with a great view from small balcony. Security was smooth and elevator could drop you off straight to street level. Great walking spot to wonderful restaurants, beach and high end shops. Everyone was helpful with directions or suggestions, especially Maria @ reception, exceptional service & fun with a pleasant attitude. ","Venice, Florida",20,5.0

We were having an amazing time at a most wonderful hotel. The staff, led by Caroline Grass, is what makes this hotel so special. Caroline could not have been more helpful or caring and her skills dealing with guests are unparalleled. We travel extensively and she is the best among the best. We would return just because of her --- even if the hotel were not such a lovely property.The location is terrific, there is an adults only pool, and the elevators operate on a unique system so you almost never have to wait and they are never crowded with people. A great place to stay",vancouver island,196,5.0

A relatively new hotel the location, rooms, grounds, pool and the service staff are impeccable. Everything you would expect at a Ritz Carlton but this one is above the one in Maui by far. I live in Waikiki so I have been to most of the properties over the years. Chris in the Valet was particularly fantastic packing our vehicle for the next destination!","Waikiki, Hawaii",10,5.0
