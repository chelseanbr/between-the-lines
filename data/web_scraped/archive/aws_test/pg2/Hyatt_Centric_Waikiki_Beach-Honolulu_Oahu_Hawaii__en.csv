This is one thing that needs to be addressed by all major hotels as guests arriving after a long flight there needs to be some leniency in allowing them to a room to freshen up. The other factor was that although the hotel advertises it has a pool you can not swim as it is only ankle deep, if we had known this at the time of booking we would had gone elsewhere. There was also certain things that we liked about the hotel, one was location as it was close to the beach, restaurants, bars and transport, the rooms were also a good size but the fridge could be larger, the bathroom was a good size but lighting poor, toilet area could be enclosed, there is no laundry and directions to one were incorrect, but there is one close by as we found, the in house restaurant meals were good as well as the service, although the hotel offered bar service it only opened 3 days after our arrival and then only stayed open for about 4 days of our stay. Overall our stay was good and most of the staff were friendly and helpful but due to Covid 19 pandemic services became very thin in Waikiki about 6 days before departure and it was hard to get healthy food.",,0,4.0

We were greeted by the resident dog. We brought our dog for the night as it was a spring break staycation for my daughter and I. The room was lovely and shortly after we got to our room a great quality dog bed and dog bowl was delivered.There were chic reusable take home water bottles for us in the room. A coffee maker and a fridge. The room was large and modern! The shower is to die for. ","Honolulu, Hawaii",5,5.0

My boyfriend and I decided to still go in the midst of all the coronavirus chaos. But unfortunately, a lot can happen in a few days, and we had to cut our trip short because the area we live ordered a shelter in place. Thank you to the amazing team at the Hyatt! They were the calm in the storm and assured us everything would be fine! They refunded us for the days that we wouldn’t be able to stay. Before we had to cut our trip short, we had an amazing stay at the Hyatt! The rooms are extremely clean, the pool is beautiful, and the breakfast spot is delicious. But most importantly, the employees are TOP NOTCH. They are the Hyatt’s competitive edge. They make the experience the best. Every time you walk down the halls, the cleaning team ALWAYS smiles and says “Aloha!” I wish I got their names so I could give them a shoutout. Everyone we talked to at the front desk were super friendly and helpful. Shoutout to Devonn, Rachel, and Tiare. They answered all of our questions, and kept us calm through this whole experience. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!We will for sure be back after the coronavirus has passed!",,0,5.0
