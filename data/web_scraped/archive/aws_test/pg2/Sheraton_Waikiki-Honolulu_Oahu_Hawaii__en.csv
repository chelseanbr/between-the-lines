Have history here, Hyatt, Hilton. The newly remodeled Sheraton is clearly at Top of List. Spectacular infinite pool, direct Waikiki beach access, and a very modern lobby/shopping pavilion. No need for car; Uber everywhere from this fabulous location. Plus, if you can, take advantage of Club Level for a Million Dollar View of Waikiki. Hoping to help ""Sheraton"" re-open in June!!!!","North Port, Florida",18,5.0

Staff was very helpful with directions and instructions on how to get around the island. Rooms were very clean and modern. The beds were amazing!! The best sleep I have ever had in a hotel was here. On the ocean side there was a beautiful infinity pool with access to the beach and tiki bar. I will never stay anywhere else in Waikiki.,"Summerville, South Carolina",2,5.0

Mind you that check-in starts at 3 PM there is at this time a line of about 15 people and one person checking people in. There are two people for the Elite Bonvoy members and about six people waiting in line there. Why are there four people at bell service including a manager with no line? This is prime time check-in time absolutely ridiculous that this isnâ€™t staffed accordingly. Picked an ocean king room - the view and room was great. However there are no amenities in the room like shower cap, robe or slippers. I find this strange for a Sheraton property- they actually sell hotel slippers in the gift shop downstairs which I find absurd. Upon checking into my room I found chocolate on my pillow and also all on the side of my bed on the floor. I called the front desk and surprisingly they did not offer a room change they just sent people to come and clean the carpets and change the sheets. They did offer however to waive my resort fees which was OK. It just makes me question their cleaning - as the corona pandemic is happening and they are missing these small things like are they REALLLY cleaning their hotel? ","New York City, New York",19,3.0
