It was a very last min find, but it did not dissapoint. Great location. The staff were friendly, helpful and fun. I always had something to do during the day with their good range of excursions available, and for a good price. The atmosphere was great every evening. If you are a solo traveller, I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. You are guaranteed to make friends for life. I stayed in a 6 person dorm. Very pleased with the condition and cleanliness of it, the cleaners were there daily. Lockers for valuables (don't forget a lock for it). Access to Fridge and freezer. And the rooftop is a great social area, during the day and at night. All in all, brilliant, I did not want to leave. Fantastic hostel.",,0,5.0

I had never stayed in a hostel before so didn’t know what to expect but I can honestly say it was the best experience ever!!! The staff are some of the nicest people, so welcoming and helpful and also super fun!! The tours and activities they offer are incredible! We went on a booze cruise with the hostel and it was one of the highlights of my trip!!! The rooms are very spacious with great amenities! Thanks to Ashley, Andrew, jaimie and all the other staff who made our trip and stay one to remember! I cannot wait to stay there again for my next trip back to Honolulu! Thanks!!! ❤️",,0,5.0

Zain was very accommodating when I had a minor room mix up! Staff are at the front desk 24/7 to answer questions about things to do in Waikiki and surrounding areas. The hostel offers excursions every day - hikes, party boat, etc. Beds comfortable enough. Clean rooms. Free breakfast. Great hostel to meet other solo travellers. Really awesome environment! Not a party hostel, quite hours after 10pm, so you are able to get a decent nights rest! I have been to many hostels during my travels but I have to say - I haven’t seen such personable and helpful staff before! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend this hostel!","Winnipeg, Canada",0,5.0
