From the moment we arrived, we felt right at home and very welcomed. The staff here is amazing! Upon check in we were welcomed and provided all the information we may need on the resort as well as coupon books etc. From that time on we were greeted by name by our wonderful cleaning lady, Rosalinda who always had the biggest smile every day. We loved having access to the Voyager Club for breakfast each day and was really impressed with June and here willingness to assist with whatever we needed. Unfortunately we had to cut our trip short by a day and Ambrose at the check out desk was amazing and super accommodating with not only refunding the extra night but allowing us to stay in our room on departure day until we had to head to the airport that evening. I can't say enough about the staff at this property. Our rooms were very clean, we had a great view and enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely return.",,2,5.0

I have walked past the Outrigger Reef a number of times and honestly didn't know if they had a restaurant or not. Well, all the way in the back, overlooking the ocean, is the Reef! Great menu with lots of available items, a self-service salad bar and if you want to, you can grill your meal on the huge open grills. We got to watch the sunset and really enjoyed just hanging out, listening to the waves and getting our Hawaiian vacation off to a great start!","Henderson, Nevada",52,5.0

We had the most amazing 2 weeks, all the staff were very attentive and helpful. Restaurants and Malls are very close and for all tastes. Fully reccommend this resort.",,1,5.0
