They need to take that off their site because I didn't hear a sound! Wasn't feeling well the last day and had a late departure and Aqua Bamboo offered to let me check out at 6 pm for a small fee. I wanted to get some sun so I turned down their offer. About 2 hours later I came back because still not feeling well and they had already cleaned my room but STILL let me stay until my flight. Great location. Will definitely be back! A HUI Hou!,,1,5.0
