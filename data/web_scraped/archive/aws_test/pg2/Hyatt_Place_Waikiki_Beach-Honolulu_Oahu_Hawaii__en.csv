However, everything was tired and sad, with the dim lights and grim color. The bedsheet had a hole ; the cleaning staff brought new linens later; but this showed the level of service in this hotel. There was a balcony but there was not much to see, since the hotel and the room I got was cramped among the surrounding buildings. The staff are OK. I don't see some special appreciation for local Hawaii residents.",,1,2.0
