While we could not do anything but walk along the street by the lovely park nearby we had a great view of the ocean from our room - where needless to say we spent most of our time before our flight home. But the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and the hotel restaurant was doing limited menu dinner “take-out” delivered to your room. They made the best of a difficult time for all of us.","Birmingham, Alabama",1,5.0

This time they went even further.We intended to stay 5 nights at the end of a two week Honolulu vacation. Because of the COVID-9 situation, they allowed us to cancel the last 4 nights without penalty even though we were past the refund cutoff...and, they helped us by refunding the original cost deposit and gave us the present ""COVID-9"" pricing, virtually half the original price.Everyone of the staff were very helpful and full of Aloha, in the midst of their own difficulties during this period.We are forever Lotus Fans !!!","Hilton Head, South Carolina",32,5.0

The Lotus Honolulu at Diamond Head is the perfect blend between high-end hotel & boutique property. Upon arrival we had confusion about our booking; but JR went out of his way to ensure the accommodation exceeded expectations. The small resort fee also covers valet parking a HUGE perk in this area. We loved the location on the quieter part of Kalākaua Ave yet walkable to Waikiki. Bonus = each morning the front desk manager warmly greeted us (by name) as she checked out free beach chairs & towels for us. ,"Portland, Oregon",6,5.0
