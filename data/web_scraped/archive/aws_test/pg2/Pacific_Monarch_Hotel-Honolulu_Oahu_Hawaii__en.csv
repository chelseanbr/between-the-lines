We loved it here. Yes, it's not the Hyatt or the Four Seasons, but it has everything you are looking for at a reasonable price. My wife and I are pretty selective about where we stay. This place worked. We had a suite on the 29th floor and would recommend to anyone that they try and get a higher room and an '02' room (any room that ends in 02). Separate bedroom, small living room, full kitchen with stove/oven, M/W double sink. and adequate bathroom. The best of this room however was the Lanai, the deck, the balcony. We could access it from either our bedroom sliding doors or through the living room. It's huge - we had seven people on it. it has a GREAT view of the ocean. It gets morning sun and partial afternoon sun. You can move around to get sun or shade throughout the day. We spent a LOT of time on the lanai. It's also private, you cant hear or see any of your neighbors in the building. We loved this lanai a lot and you will too. Other amenities in the building? Beach towels, nice pool on the roof. Location is about 200 meters from the beach. Staff is excellent. Place was clean and cleaned well daily. We had very good service from Danny and Rose. We'd recommend Pacific Monarch and would stay here again next time we're in Waikiki.","St. Albert, Canada",6,5.0

Staff are very friendly always willing to help. Although the decor is dated you canâ€™t beat the location. Having stayed in a few different rooms I would always pay extra for the one bedroom ocean view room,,0,4.0
