The staff and ambiance were absolutely fantastic. The breakfast was a nice touch in the morning. Unfortunately because of the pandemic we were not allowed to use the pool or sauna but that's all the more reason to come back!,"Pearl City, Hawaii",0,5.0

Things were starting to shut down around us and the weather wasn't great for a lot of the days. Our stay at this hotel was a bright spot of our trip as the staff was very friendly, the rooms were comfortable and well taken care of, and the continental breakfast was a really nice addition. Our experience with the staff, especially Olivia, was top notch. Her aloha spirit and willingness to help us and be flexible was so appreciated.'Thank you for a great trip!",,0,5.0
