Expensive as well for a moderate room, everything is relatively close in Waikiki so location was ok. Staff were very helpful with all my requests. It was booked through a travel agent and was staying solo so I also had to pay a single supplement which made the price expensive considering the facilities. Breakfast was included i tried it one didn't bother the other three mornings you can read into that.","Christchurch, New Zealand",29,3.0

You'd expect when welcoming fellow Kama'aina there'd be a bit more Aloha, but nothing. They didn't want to be there. They also tried to tell me my rate wasn't Kama'aina and wouldn't remove the Resort Fee despite my confirmation stating it was. It really was a terrible first impression, and as they say, first impressions last. Also, their website states they offer Kama'aina a free upgrade if available - no mention of this either.Secondly, elevators were very slow - there are only 2, and one was broken. You need to plan a LOT of time; sometimes as much as 10 minutes, to get up and down.Carpet in the room was dirty. Rooms were NOT serviced (no towels replaced, no cleaning) as my stay was only 2 nights (3 days). When I inquired at reception I was told ""... We only do that for stays over 3 nights"". This was NOT clear anywhere, nor was I told this at check-in. If I was, I would have been OK, and would have realized I could have just asked for new towels.. but the lack of communication was poor.Also, CONSTRUCTION. Lots of drilling beginning at 7am. I was not informed of this during check-in either. Go back to your room at 4pm for a rest? Forget about it - DRILLING. Loud. In reality, I think they give Kama'aina the *worst* rooms.Admittedly, hotels in HNL are only for you to sleep in. They are cheap, good location, but that is it. I would rather spend more $ to get some Aloha. Will NOT recommend, or stay here again, sorry.","Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",34,2.0

This hotel provides breakfast and it is good. I booked through booking.com and got a small room. Rooms are clean. Hotel staff members are very good and cooperative.,,3,3.0
