It has a very local Hawaiian feel, with a very pretty tropical pool area. All of the rooms have recently been redone, also in the local Hawaiian motif. The location is really convenient to the beach, stores, restaurants, and the staff is super friendly. All of this at a reasonable price!","Rochester, NY",63,5.0

I spent 3 nights here the weekend before the Coronavirus lockdown began and was given a spacious room facing Nohonani St. on the 2nd floor. I arrived early at 11am and tried doing early check-in but the front desk was demanding $50 so I opted for free luggage storage instead and returned in the evening after doing some sight-seeing. The king bed was very comfortable, the free WiFi internet was fast and the bathroom was well stocked with towels and toiletries. There was no bathtub and the shower stall's shower head was positioned really low and couldn't be raised. The TV had plenty of channels, in English as well as foreign languages. Transportation-wise, this hotel is very well connected to most landmarks with a direct bus, such as 19/20 from HNL airport and downtown, 42 to/from Pearl Harbor, 2 to/from Diamond Head, etc. There are plenty of restaurants and convenience stores along nearby Kuhio Ave and aforementioned International Market Place has free Hula performances in the evening in the central foyer. A good choice if you are looking for a budget hotel in Waikiki and don't want to pay a lot in resort fees.","San Jose, California",11,5.0

Some staff nice; a couple of them not so nice. Parking sucks and not guaranteed your entire stay. Stalls are small and guests don't know how to park; they need a good valet that know how to reverse into small spaces to park cars. No standard amenities, like a coffee maker in room; kitchenette, but no dishware, glasses, utensils etc. Shabby looking hallways. Not enough towels; had to go to front desk for extras; had to ask room maids for toilet paper and kleenex; our stay was 4 adults for 3 nights. Emphasize, pay the resort fees and stay somewhere else!","Hilo, Hawaii",0,2.0
