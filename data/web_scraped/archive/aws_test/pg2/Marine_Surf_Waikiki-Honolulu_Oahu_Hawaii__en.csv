The units are not serviced but that was not a problem great location and Thomas and Deb really easy to deal with and very reasonable priced. If you are looking for 5 Star this is not for you but if you want good accommodation at a reasonable price consider this place","Brisbane, Australia",8,4.0

That’s what did it for me! But the place was also great in itself. A small condo, bed, kitchenette, lanai, and bath - what else do I need for a few days? Walking distance to the beach and Waikiki, Easy access to get to North Shore, Kailua, Kahala and ... where to next? Easy check-in, clean, and comfortable. ","Banning, California",65,5.0

About a 5 minute walk to the beach (at the Royal Hawaiian), 30 seconds from an ABC Store, and so many great restaurants within a quick walk. A very safe area.The condo is clean, well stocked and comfortable. Everyone has their own preferences for a bed... but, we found it quite comfortable. Great city view from the balcony.Very secure building. Great basic pool and deck area... quiet. Only one other person there when we were there. And a few times, just us.Dedicated parking is convenient and included.Our host met us at the condo and gave us a run down of everything. Very friendly.The only drawback, which isn’t a dealbreaker, is that the area is noisy in the early morning. Generally, we were awake then anyways.","Edmonton, Canada",21,4.0
