Negatives that frustrated us:1. No room service.2. No mini-fridge in room. 3. No bottle-opener in room. (Front desk first advised me to bring my beer bottle to the lobby bartender)4. Room not cleaned after 1st night; bed still a mess. Upon calling Reception, was told housekeeping had left for day. 5. Noisy outside. Even from high up safely in our room, the popularity of the hotel's lobby-side bar, a trendy spot, contributed to a loud nightly experience echoing outside, including passing drunken characters off the Waikiki strip road. Not in control of hotel, its true, but irksome.Positives: 1. Pool, lounge deck and restaurant. Very chic, pool was very clean and great refreshing temperature. Service at the restaurant/bar was excellent, as was quality of the lunch and drinks.2. Room: Chic minimal design, quality of bed linens and bathroom all very good. 3. Reception & Bellhops: Friendly and helpful attitude.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates",155,2.0

There is no warning that the hotel is under a major renovation. There is no warning that they're going to try to sell you their version of a time share - and if you've got $173,500 laying around it is a great deal to use points to travel all over the world. I did sit though the presentation and the people were very kind - but when I said I can't afford this and tried to walk away it was a little like being surrounded by an octopus. They were very nice - but weren't about to let me go without a fight. The 2.5 hours of presentation and saying no no no did get me some amazing discounts - so that was a good thing. The room we were in was not renovated - and was quite frankly run down - the carpet was dirty. The blackout curtain was stuck - it took me two days to get that fixed and then there was a giant wooden vertical blind that slid back and forth hampering the ""partial ocean view"" (we were supposed to have an OCEAN VIEW - not partial. The front desk and concierge were great - friendly knowledgeable and prompt, after I came back a second time to say the curtain is still broken. The bartenders at both bars were amazing - however the waitstaff was non-existent as far as I am concerned - I resigned myself to going to the bar for a drink - because they NEVER came to the table. If you are going to stay - and it is central to Waikiki and shopping etc - make sure you insist on a newly renovated room. I saw them - and they are beautiful - another carrot to get you to buy in to the timeshare.","Gladstone, Oregon",3,3.0

Rooms poor and with zero maintenance, damaged by the passage of time and with a very poor cleaning.Services bad.The room cleaning team works poorly and is pretty rude.The chairs and table in the balcony were full of rust, the carpet on the floor inside the room was filthy.A lot of items listed in description are not present in the room.Then, a ”fun fact”. There is a coffee machine in the room. We had just 3 coffee capsules (1 normal, 2 deca), and 2 paper cups. They never refilled. Why? Because they SELL both capsules and cups at the shop at the first floor. I’ve never seen something like that in a 5-star hotel. It’s so disappointing and frankly unacceptable.Final ”fun fact”: we were supposed to get a Ocean view room (we paid for that!), whereas we got just a ”partial ocean view”.The price could be ok for a 5-star, but compared to everything, it is completely unfair.Never again.","Turin, Italy",0,2.0
