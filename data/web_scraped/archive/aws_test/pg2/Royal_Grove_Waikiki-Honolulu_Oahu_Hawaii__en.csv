The rooms were super clean as well as the bathroom. I have to say that the sink could a longer faucet because it was hard to wash our hands. Our room had a nice balcony were we could rest and our room offered a kitchen and a fridge really convenient in case you want to cook and also just to mingle a bit together. It has a small swimming pool which is convenient if you do not want to go to the really close Waikiki beach. But if you prefer to go to the beach it is less than 2 minutes walking. Staff at the hotel were really nice and helpful too. Besides being super close to the beach is near many Waikiki attractions as well as a shopping area. I believe for the prices they offer if you only need a place to sleep this is the prefect place.,"Norman, Oklahoma",13,5.0

Hotel is old and dated and probably 1/2 the price of the larger updated high rises that surround it. We enjoyed our stay and spending time by the quiet pool area. Nothing fancy here but was clean and staff were there to assist you with your needs.,"Edmonton, Canada",0,4.0
