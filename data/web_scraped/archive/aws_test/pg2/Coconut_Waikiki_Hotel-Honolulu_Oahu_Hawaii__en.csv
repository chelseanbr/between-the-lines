The location is great, easy walk to the beach and to restaurants or shops. The rooms are clean and the service is great. The hotel is under renovation and some of the rooms didn’t have access to their balconies. Hopefully, the renos will be completed soon.",,2,5.0

Stayed here and booked a standard room, get there and get upgraded to the view of the canal. Some reviews say it’s noisy because of the traffic. “Alright fancy man, live in your quiet suburban house.” There was traffic and noise, but not once I thought “Hey, the reviews are right, it is loud.” These reviewers should just stick to the main hub of tourist Waikiki. The staff are just fantastic and super nice. Breakfast was great. Added bonus. Popcorn throughout the day. Added bonus. Towels for the pool and beach. Added bonus. I have stayed before in the major hotels here and to be honest, this was a little more enjoyable. Great location. I am definitely going to stay here again next time. And across from the canal is a dog park too. Who does not love sitting on a balcony, drinking and watching dogs be stupid. Just do yourself a favour and book it. Do it.",,1,5.0
