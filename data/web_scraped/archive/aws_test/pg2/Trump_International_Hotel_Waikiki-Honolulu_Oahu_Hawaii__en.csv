There was a full kitchen plus a washer and dryer (no need to over pack) in the room. The hotel is within walking distance of high-end shopping and 3 ABC Stores for daily supplies. The staff is extremely helpful (especially Dean, in valet). The hotel is expensive but Costco offers some great incentives and discounts.","Las Vegas, Nevada",4,5.0

They are so friendly and helpful. I never encountered a staff member who was not smiling, from the front desk to the person bringing us extra waters to our rooms. The room layout is amazing, beautiful bathrooms with Italian marble, the ocean view room has such a great layout that when you sit on the couch, you have a 100% ocean view even though standing on the balcony your view is tilted to half being the ocean and half being the city, you get it all! The rooms also come with a refrigerator that they will daily (or if you call) and all the necessities you could want should you want to cook (silverware, pots, pans, blender, you name it...) and they wash your dishes for you daily. The complimentary beach bags with towels and fruit is also a great convenient service they offer. Buffet breakfast was delicious as well. Best hotel Iâ€™ve stayed at in Waikiki.","Lake Forest, California",0,5.0
