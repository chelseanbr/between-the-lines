Very well kitted out to make it feel like home away from home. If I could make one suggestion it would be to put in a bigger bed, with a more ornate bed cover and pillows.",,0,4.0

Kitchen was clean and stocked with coffee. Overall ambience of room was great. Cinnamon restaurant was excellent choice for both breakfast and dinner. Hawaiian musicians, Kaawa Entertainment was excellent while we had our dinner. They sang our party a special song and made us feel very special. Valet service workers were accommodating and very welcoming. Reception desk was very helpful and had lots of aloha. Lobby area was always clean and clear for patrons to come and go comfortably. Loved the little shops around the hotel. We definitely will have another staycation in the future.",,0,5.0
