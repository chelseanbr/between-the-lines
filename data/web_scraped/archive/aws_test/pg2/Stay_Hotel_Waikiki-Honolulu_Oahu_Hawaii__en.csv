The front desk manager, Florencia, honestly turned my whole day around. She was so patient and kind, and it made all the difference. I ended up staying only one night, but it was still a great experience. The hotel is only a block from the beach, and there are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants nearby. The hotel itself had everything I needed, and the lobby downstairs even provided beach chairs and boggie boards you could borrow. There was also a store right next door if you wanted to rent a surfboard. I had an amazing time here, and if I ever return to Waikiki, this is where I'll be returning to stay. Thank you!",,0,5.0

The communication was prompt and they were understanding. When I eventually get to Hawaii I will be rebooking with them solely for the customer service! Thanks guys!,"Ipswich, Australia",8,5.0

We decided to stay at the Stay Hotel. It was one of the best decisions that we made on this girl trip. The hotel was literally near the beach (2 to 3 minutes walking distance). The coffee that is provided from the hotel is delicious and always being served in the morning. The staff members were friendly and kind. Our room was always cleaned when we come back at the end of the day - excellent housekeeping staff! We would like to thank Kitty for always making us feel welcome while we were there. She always has that smile on her face whenever we see her. :) We will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend this hotel!",,0,5.0
