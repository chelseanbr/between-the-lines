We had a 2 bedroom suite which was of decent size for Honolulu. We loved the music drifting up at night. The hotel is very well located in walking distance to the best shopping and restaurants. My only knock is the parking fee, which can be mitigated by helpful staff giving tips for free local parking.","Toronto, Canada",23,4.0
