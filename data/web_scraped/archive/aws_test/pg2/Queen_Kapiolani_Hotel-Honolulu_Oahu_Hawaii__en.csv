We can't recommend it highly enough. We splurged for their Premier Ocean View room and it was worth every penny and more. The view from this room was the best we've ever had at any hotel we've stayed at in our 37 years of marriage. First, the location is excellent if you don't want to be stuck in the middle of all the high rises in the middle of Waikiki while looking at the side of a building from your window/balcony. Our room looked out at unobstructed views of Diamond Head to the east and the Pacific Ocean and the beach to the south. Plus, the Kapiolani Park is right below and spreads out to the east. So, you can go over there and walk around and see whatever events are going on. While we were there there was a local artisan fair going on. And a few minutes walk away there is a wonderful little cafe/restaurant right on the beach where you can go for breakfast or lunch called the Barefoot Beach Cafe. Don't miss that! You can order your food and eat it in the open air right next to the ocean. The rooms are very nice and clean, but not the most modern you will find. But, the location is the main thing here. The staff was great. Always friendly and welcoming. The restaurant there is fine, but you have so many options nearby that you don't have to eat there. Overall, you can't beat the value given the incredible views.",Michigan,0,5.0

Location is great - not on the beach but close enough. With the exception of one unhelpful front desk clerk, all service staff was attentive and friendly. Paying extra for the ocean view room gets you that view if you walk out on your balcony and lean over the railing so don't trust the pictures published online and save yourself the $32/night.","Avon, Colorado",0,4.0

It was a stressful time because of the Coronavirus but that did not stop the staff from giving their best.","Hilo, Hawaii",0,4.0
