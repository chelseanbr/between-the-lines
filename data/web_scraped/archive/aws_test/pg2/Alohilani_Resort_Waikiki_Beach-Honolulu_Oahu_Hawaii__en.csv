Ocean and mountain view rooms. Excellent comfortable beds. Place is very clean, good sized rooms, water filters to refill your water bottles. Great pool/bar area. Offer activities like aqua aerobics. I would stay that is a 4 star not a 5 star resort compared to other 5 stars around. Be careful when booking as we booked online and then when we got there and checked in had additional charges wuch as resort fee and our bill had other charges were were not aware of that we had to pay. Great resturants, with Morimota Asia amazing for a amazing food and experience. We caught an uber to the airport as it is cheaper than taking the shuttle. Great location, right near beach and the main road. Would stay again. ","Sydney, Australia",57,4.0

The room was clean, bed was super comfy, and the view from the balcony was to die for (35 floor with a view of the city and beach). The staff was great. We had everything we needed. Rooms were cleaned regularly. I cannot speak much for the hotel ameneties - I used the infinity pool once. The Oceanarium in the lobby was really neat to see. The location of the hotel is fantastic - it is steps from the beach and is right on Kalakaua Ave. I ate once at Morimoto (second floor of the hotel). I sat on the patio that is overlooking Waikiki beach. I only sampled a few items from the menu and found to be fairly tasty. Parking is expensive (40 usd per day). I found parking close by for much cheaper - for those of you searching for a place to park your car. The Honolulu Zoo does not allow for overnight parking anymore (4 hours max). You can park at the Waikiki Banyan (very close to the hotel -approx. 2-3 min walk) 80 usd for a week with in and out privileges. The one problem that I had with the hotel is the amount of homeless wandering around the hotel...The staff need to be more attentive to this. As I was going back to my hotel room on the 35th floor there was a homeless man wandering around the hallway...I have no idea how he got there. It really does not look like a luxury resort when you see this...All in all, I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again in the future.","Toronto, Canada",13,4.0

The location is across the street from the beach. Our reason for choosing this particular hotel was due to all the amenities they offered. Unfortunately, everything started closing down or was canceled due to the coronavirus! I was looking forwars to the lei making....canceled. The baracuda restaurant, canceled. Yoga on rooftop...canceled...canceled...CANCELED! I mean dern it virus! I know it was out of THEIR control but, we definitely did NOT get what was paid for. I will NOT be coming back here to this hotel. I've stayed in much better hotels. On the brighy side, the infinity pool was beautiful but, the jacuzzi was dirty. The kids were splashing and diving even though 'NO DIVING' was allowed. The Longboard staff was super friendly! They don't have a lot of options though. I did love the acai bowl...yum! An omlette bar would be a FANTASTIC addition. Some turkey bacon or sausage would be nice, too. The salmon was delish,too. The complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body cream smells super duper nice! The heated toilet seat kinda caught us off guard at first lol! The view is amazing. We didn't get to get massage we wanted. Had to end up walking about 15 mins away to a sketchy looking place to get one. I mean....what more can I say? Glad I was in Hawaii?? I would try other options somewhere else IF we come back. Aloha! (Good-bye)",,3,3.0
