I like the handicap room, which is close to the ice machine, laundry, and vending machine. Before the covid19 hit, the hotel was well maintain, my room was always clean. Staff are friendly. I especially want to shout out to ROFEL for all her fantastic friendliness and always keeping my room clean even during the current pandemic COVID19. She have a passion for her work, she remember my schedule, which she use to keep my room clean with all the right social distancing applied. Many Many thanks for your kindness. You are ESSENTIAL!",,0,5.0

Clean room and is dated a little bit very clean. Bed was comfortable and had a microwave and freezer if you were staying longer. We stayed for only one night before a flight home. The free bus transfer took us at 5 am to the airport and he was lovely. We had a good experience. ,"Mudgee, Australia",0,5.0

The place needs an upgrade in the worst way. It was humid inside the hotel, the decor looks like it hasn't been updated in eons and we couldn't wait to get out of there. Pity because it's right at the airport, they offer pickup and delivery to/from the terminal and the room was clean.","Laguna Beach, California",4,2.0
