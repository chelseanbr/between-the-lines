It's my 2nd time coming to Hawai'i. I had a partial ocean view. Plus mountain view. I enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend staying here.

New room away from beach in different tower. Constantly called about timeshare briefs (hell no) and told to pick up our coupon packets 5 days into stay. ,"Hilliard, Ohio",7,3.0

This could be in any big city in the world. We had a 3 bedroom penthouse on the 38th floor. The view is lovely, the air conditioning is very efficient and the high rise feel of it is not my idea of a Hawaiian vacation. The pools are very crowded, the beach is fine, but not special. I would prefer to go to a different island or at least a different area for a more authentic beach holiday. I cannot complain about the service, cleanliness nor accommodations. But for me, this is not what I enjoy about Hawaii","Los Angeles, California",137,4.0
