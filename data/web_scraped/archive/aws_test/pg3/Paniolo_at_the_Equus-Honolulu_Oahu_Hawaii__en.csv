We are mid 60’s travellers and found the hotel great for us to walk both to Diamond Head and Down Town Honolulu.Easy checkin. The room had all it said it had. Our room was near the front so a little noisy but nothing we couldn’t handle. Staff mostly very friendly and helpful. I think the room might have benefitted from a little more attention when being cleaned especially in the bathroom, also the bottom sheet on the bed never covered the mattress! We had a great breakfast in the bar area on the last day. All in all a great little place to stay.",Suffolk,20,4.0
