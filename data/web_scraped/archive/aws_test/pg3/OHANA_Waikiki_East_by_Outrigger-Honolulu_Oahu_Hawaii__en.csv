I used Hotwire to book and got this hotel. I enjoyed my stay and found it to be family friendly (the pool was a huge hit for my kids!), the decor and aesthetic was very Hawaiian, and the walk to the beach was quick! The staff were amazing and went above and beyond to make our short stay memorable. My only gripe is the pushy timeshare people. Even with my youngest having a meltdown the lady wouldnâ€™t stop trying to get me to attend the meeting, spend $ to go, etc. it made me feel uncomfortable leaving the lobby since we had to go past her.","Anchorage, Alaska",0,4.0

It was clean and the staff were friendly. The room had a minifridge, toaster and microwave so we had breakfast in our room to help to reduce costs.We had a king sized bed which was quite comfortable.From this location it was only a couple of blocks from Waikiki beach and many shops and restaurants. We were moved from our original room as the air conditioner was producing a constant drip of water onto the carpet and we couldn't open our balcony door. The staff was quite accommodating and the move was not difficult.The swimming pool was quite cold (I don't think it was heated) so we didn't use it as much as we would have liked. The hot tub was comfortable. I only gave this hotel 3 stars because of the noisy construction going on next door and across the street. Noise from the construction started most mornings before 7am. I know this is not the fault of our hotel but its something for a visitor to consider if going to Honolulu in the near future. The construction in both locations is just starting so will likely be ongoing for some time.I note that all of the hotels charge an ""ammenity"" fee. The fee for this hotel was $20.00 US per night and charged when you check out of the hotel. I think this fee is underhanded and a hidden fee to make the hotel more money while making their room price appear more reasonable. I would much rather have hotels be upfront about the total cost of a room in their advertised pricing as opposed to adding this fee to the fine print. Be careful when looking into hotels as this fee of $20.00 was one of the lower fees for hotels in the area. This can add quite a cost to your holiday.","Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Canada",2,3.0
