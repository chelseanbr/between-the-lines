Make sure everything works in your room, even batteries in the remote, they can't change it at front desk, maintenance has to come change it out. All in all great experience.

We were in town for a Dr. appt. for my pregnancy and didn't have the extra funds to book a fancy resort, but this felt like one! The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. They offer some fun, free ""wellness perks"" that are included as part of your resort free. I always pay the fee anyway, so it was nice to see something come of it. I had my Chinese New Year astrology reading, and a wellness beverage. It was fun and relaxing. The best part is the location to the beach. My 2-year old daughter could walk there without being carried, and the hotel provided free beach towels, beach toys, beach floaties, and beach chairs! Our daughter was in heaven :) Good restaurants nearby including Denny's and Wolfgang Puck to go (breakfast waffle highly recommended) and mac n' cheese for the little one. It's also right next to ABC store (practically located in their lobby). Only advice I would give is to just pay the extra $35 for parking. Otherwise it's $6/2-hours on the street and you end up paying most of the $35 anyway. We didn't pay it the last day and just parked at the zoo which was $3/2-hours but we weren't parking overnight so it made more sense. Loved the layout, cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. Have a great time! Thanks to Stephanie for the wellness perks!",,0,4.0

Centralized location makes it easy to get to places. Good food around the way and nice pool. Looking forward to checking out more places and recommending this to friends",,0,5.0
