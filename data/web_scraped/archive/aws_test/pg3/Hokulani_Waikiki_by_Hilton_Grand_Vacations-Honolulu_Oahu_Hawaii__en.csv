The Hokulani is centrally located with many great restaurants nearby. The roof top pool, lounge chairs and cabanas put this venue over-the-top. Condos are very clean. Beds and living room furniture recently upgraded. Highly recommend.","Tokyo, Japan",2,5.0

About a block or so from the beach. Lots of eating options nearby but we were also able to cook some small meals in the kitchen. There was a drip coffee maker and a rice cooker. Pots and pans were also good quality. We stayed for a week so cooked several of the days. Very large bathroom which probably appeals to many guests, underutilized by us as a long soak in the tub seemed less interesting than all the loveliness outside. Parking attendants were great, very efficient. $40 a day is a lot but you are in the heart of the tourist area. We did drive out most days and found it convenient to see areas other than Waikiki. But also enjoyed just walking to things nearby so probably would still stay in same area if we come back. Staff was very friendly. Some downsides. Bed was very soft. We were on the 5 th floor above the AC and near the street. Both were loud so we could not keep the patio doors open. We had asked to switch but they said they were all booked. ",Boston,34,4.0

We came with our young family and there was something for everyone! Would recommend to friends and would definitely return! Small but usable kitchen for easy meals in the go!
