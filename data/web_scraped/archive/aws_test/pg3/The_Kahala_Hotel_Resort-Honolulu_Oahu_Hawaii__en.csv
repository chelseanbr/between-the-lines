The staff was extremely helpful throughout our week's stay. The room was unbelievable with a great view. From an very comfortable bed (best night's sleep) to the heated toilet seats, cleanliness of the room, turndown service with chocolates and beautiful hotel grounds. This is a bucket list hotel for sure. There is a nice waterfall as you walk out of the back of the hotel, dolphins swimming around in their pond, incredible swimming pool area,great restaturant and the most beautiful private beach. Absolutely incredble hotel. Highly recommend!!!!","Clermont, Florida",24,5.0

Has one of the top restaurants in Hawaii - Hoku's w wonderful food and an even better view, expensive but worth it, also wonderful afternoon tea in the main foyer also, Plumeria Beach House restaurant on the Pool level has a buffet to die for and Arancino has delightful Italian food. You really don't have to leave the hotel for grand dining experiences. PLUS there are still dolphins in the lagoon and you can watch them all day long from your lounge by the pool, finally the beach is tremendous too, put all of that on top of great rooms with sea views and golf priv's at the Kohala country club (right beside the hotel) and you simply cannot beat a stay at the Kohala Hotel and Resort. Disclosure, Paradise does not come cheap, check the rates to be sure you are OK with the cost of the experience. If you try it, I think you'll feel like it is worth every dollar spent. PS Hoku's is our favorite place for Birthday Dinners.","Honolulu, Hawaii",14,5.0

Upon check in, there was some confusion as to which package I reserved through a third party. It was determined that I would have no idea that the package was for Hawaiian Residents and both the front desk and the manager (Brian) dealt with it perfectly. They were wonderful and treated us fantastically. We were there during some rough weather and the virus looming. We had a wonderful time. We ate at the onsite restaurants and they were delicious. We were able to use the fitness center and the equipment was plentiful and very good The view from our spacious balcony was heavenly The bathroom was laid out great. Housekeeping was perfect. The entire resort was spotless, It was a lovely environment. We will definitely choose The Kahala again when we visit Oahu!! Thank you for a wonderful trip!",,0,5.0
