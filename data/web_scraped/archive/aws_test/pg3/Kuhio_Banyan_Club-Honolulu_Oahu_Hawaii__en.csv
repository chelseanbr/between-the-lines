The good: great location, Murphy bed was surprisingly comfortable, good to have fridge and dishes. The rest: the room is small, old, and although clean in appearance we didn't trust it and covered the furniture and wore socks/shoes in the unit. Not the kind of resort where you will be able to enjoy time in your room. Up in the morning and back at night. They misrepresent the ""resort fee"" of $200 as a state tax but it is not that and you cannot opt out of paying for it. This allows you to ""borrow"" a barbie size blow drier and a remote for your TV. They offered local parking for a very cheap rate for the week and we recouped the $200 by attending a vacation club presentation. Nothing was a surprise to us and knew what we were getting when we accepted this trade. Best we could get in the location in the heart of Waikiki. ","Toronto, Canada",10,2.0

If you are looking for a basic efficiency room with the basics this is your spot. The location is very good. Close to bus stop and international market place as well as Dukes alley and Waikiki beach. The room had a nice kitchen area. The bed was better than I expected as it was a fold down Murphy bed. The check in process was tedious but once you get past that the cost and location are the best. There is an elevator which was nice with lots of luggage. Be aware that there is a resort fee and they place a 250 deposit for security. If you need luxury donâ€™t expect it here. This is basic great value lodging.,,7,5.0

Got this through Travelocity for a very good price. Got a room with a very moldy air conditioner but that was fixed immediately when we were upgraded to a double room suite. Staff here is great...they will do everything to help. Location is perfect...immediately across the street from the international market and 5 minute walk to beach at Royal Hawaiian Hotel. We got the kitchenette and it was stocked with everything needed to cook. The rooms are fairly old but well maintained. The only downside I see is that there is a night club on the first floor and it gets fairly loud but I think it depends where your room is and what time you are returning. Also, wifi is a bit slow but I think, it too, is on Hawaiian time.","Oslo, Norway",22,5.0
