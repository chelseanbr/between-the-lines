These were the main positives of the resort. Otherwise, the unit is very small and not comfortable. We would not stay here again. Very pricey for all that we got. We were told there was laundry, but when we went to use it, it was down. Then they said they had been trying to get the maintenance to fix it, but because it was the holidays, they would not come out... So it must have been broken for several weeks....",,0,3.0

Did not look anything like the photos. Dirty and water leaking from the AC units. The bathroom looked old and dirty with paint peeling. We didnâ€™t even stay our first night there, switched hotels to avoid staying there.","Sunset Beach, Hawaii",0,1.0
