I'm so impressed, though I'd stay here again even if I was spending a few days in Honolulu. The staff are fantastic--friendly and very helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable--nothing fancy, but the price is 1/2 that of a Waikiki hotel. If you just use a hotel to sleep, this will do the trick! Best of all for the budget-minded, The Bus stops right outside the hotel and $5.50 gets you an all-day pass. It's about an hour to central Waikiki, and even shorter the other way to Pearl Harbor. On the downside, not a lot of restaurants nearby you can walk to at night. I didn't expect a lot out of this hotel, but was very pleasantly surprised.","Phoenix, Arizona",23,4.0

The housekeeping staff turned it in promptly. Originally I had planned to pick it up 3 weeks later when I returned to Honolulu, and they agreed to keep it safe until my return. Because of coronavirus, my plans changed, and I did not stop over in Honolulu. I called the housekeeping manager to explain the change in plans, and she worked with me to send it back safely to me at my home in California. Everyone was very friendly and professional. I'm sure you can imagine how differently this could have turned out. I'm very grateful to the hotel staff and would definitely stay here again.",,0,5.0

Very quiet. Nice store in the front lobby if you need snacks, toiletries and beverages. Clean room, not cramped for space. A bit expensive to me, but you pay for convenient access to airport I guess.
