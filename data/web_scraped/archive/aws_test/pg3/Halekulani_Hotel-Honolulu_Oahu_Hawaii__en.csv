There are a few caveats:1) If you want to go to the Arizona Memorial - go on your own. ""Tours"" really do nothing for you but add expense2) Stay on property for meals - but if you book a table at House without a Key - be ready to ""queue"" up - meaning arrive at least 10 minutes before your reservation",,30,4.0

I feel that the front desk service is impersonal, reserve and cold. They will get what you want upon asking but they won’t be reaching out to do above and beyond like the experience at other luxury hotels. We are celebrating our anniversary and I did send a message to them earlier in the email and no one replied. This is the first time I sent an email to any hotel and they totally just be quiet and ignore it. Upon checking in, no acknowledgment of our anniversary, and no welcome back and no special of message in the room, except a preprinted general welcome message from the manager. They made me feel they didn’t really care about our important anniversary. I had to go mention this to them at front desk and no apology, they just later on sent us a bottle of champagne with another preprinted general card..The staff did mention to us themselves that the hotel is at its slow time due to the virus outbreak so if we were considered one of their valuable guests, I would think they could have been more attentive.We pay astronomical price for the hotel and this is not the service level that is on par with other luxury hotels we have visited all around the world.
