Recommend as an excellent option to go with the family and enjoy this wonderful place. Kids loved the Buffett and options to eat. Drinks and Poke were the best in class.,"Tomball, Texas",0,5.0

We also got amazing sleep thanks to the comfortable bed and pillows.Loved that the location was very quiet and only steps away to Ala Moana Mall, Magic Island (great place to catch the sunset) and there's a great sushi restaurant within the hotel. Yes, you have to take a 8 min Uber into the Waikiki strip area but we didn't mind at all.The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean and spacious. Would definitely stay at the Prince again as we thought it was amazing value based on water view, location, size of room and the renovation.","Hoi An, Vietnam",0,5.0

Modern and spacious all over the place. Everybody is very helpful, superb Service. Great value for money. Very close to the beach as to a recreation park perfect for seaside jogging and yoga.
