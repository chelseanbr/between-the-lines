Keep in your mind you probably paying more than 100USD here and not 40 bocks.If it costs 40 or 50 USD maybe it could be an option for someone.It is a rip off the 17USD named resort tax. Never but never more stay here again. Pay 50 USD and stay in a clean hotel but never here","Rio de Janeiro, RJ",262,1.0

Sure, the physical condition of the rooms and hallways are not the newest or cleanest. But we got a room for three people that included three single beds, a TV, a two-burner stove, fridge, and microwave at a reasonable rate. Breakfast is not included, but the in-room wi-fi is stable and relatively fast.If you need a parking space (extra charge), be sure to check-in as early as you can, because there's a limited number of spaces available.The biggest annoyances were the added fees that are not included in the advertised room rate. That practice is so common among hotels now that it's confusing and almost impossible to compare total price, which is, unfortunately, exactly what hotels want to do.",Northern California,48,4.0

You just feel dirty staying here. Male front desk agent at night was very rude. No deadbolt on door. Toilet made noise all night. NO CLOSET OR HANGERS EVEN!!! No outside guests after 10pm. Very limited parking. Will never stay here again and suggest you donâ€™t either. ,"Honolulu, Hawaii",6,1.0
