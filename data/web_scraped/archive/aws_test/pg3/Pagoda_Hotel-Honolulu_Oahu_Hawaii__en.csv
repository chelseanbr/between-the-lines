It is more like a $50 a night hotel.The website pictures must have been taken with a Snapchat filter because the hotel looks kinda like the pictures, only worse. Hallway and rooms smell musty. Not sure what was going on with the smoke detector, but there was a washcloth over it. The bathroom door was so dirty on both sides. There isn't a chain lock on the front door, and I just didn't feel very safe here. The area isn't the best area either, but it is close to the Walmart. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because they offer free movie rentals at the vending machine and have a PlayStation 3 in the room. They are also next door to a cool restaurant that has tons of Koi fish. The lady at the front desk gave us food for the fish. There is a mini fridge, microwave, and toaster in the room. We won't be coming back here.",USA,41,2.0

Debbie cheerfully confirmed my room via phone and Carlos' beaming smile awaited us and check-in was a breeze. We had breakfast & was welcomed by Tori's & Esa's aloha & Anna's great coffee! We had a problem with our phone and Leilani (our new friend) cheerfully got it replaced. We invited friend's for the Seafood Buffet & we all thoroughly gorged and enjoyed the fantastic food....unbeatable deal and well worth it! Shopping is handy we strolled to Walmart a couple times to buy necessities but there is also a small fully-stocked shop in Pagoda's lobby for drinks, sandwiches, snacks, soap, etc.. I end here after a week and will review the rest of my stay after my operation next week.","Pago Pago, American Samoa",7,4.0
