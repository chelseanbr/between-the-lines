Our unit was perfect for our stay. Nice kitchen area stocked with anything you could want. Very comfortable bed. Huge shower. Laundry facilities in basement. But the reason we loved our unit was the VIEW - looking out from the 6th floor over the zoo, DIRECTLY at Diamondhead, beach view from the balcony. Unbelievable. Lovely walking to the beach, park or shopping/dining throughout Waikiki.","Normal, IL",154,5.0

I had booked this place feeling like it would be a great match, but had seen bad reviews so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. Turns out, it was a fantastic stay. Our room was more than I could have ever dreamed of. It was very clean and a nice size. Our huge balcony ran the entire length. It was private. It had incredible views of Diamond Head, Waikiki Beach, and the zoo. The views were better than I imagined. I figured we would only have a partial ocean view. I was surprised. It was close to everything and so close to the beach and the strip. Staff was great. On the top is a massive open terrace for even more amazing panoramic views. This place checked every box and then some for us.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",89,5.0

The staff could not have been more helpful and attentive, particulary one staff member who was a older lady who i cant remember her name which i wish i could because she couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. The room we had was fine, Views were spectacular. You could literally lay in bed and look at the ocean and park while also getting a tan. Location is excellent being minutes from the beach and hustle and bustle, yet the hotel itself seemed nice and quiet and away from the hustel and bustle. Having Teddys downstairs was convenient and their burgers are great. The hotel itself could use a little updating but all in all it was fine. I would definately reccomend this for couples or small families.",,0,5.0
