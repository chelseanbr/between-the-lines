In 63 years I have had some bad experiences but none that top this one. When i rented it I did not realize it was a condo. I found it hard to locate and there wasNo one available to reach out to ask any questions. If you get a rental car plan to pay for parking. When the elevator does work it takes forever to get to you. The first night i stayed they shut the elevator down for the entire weekend and i Had to carry my luggage up and down to the 24th floor the entire time. Again no one on premises to reach out to. Once i got in the room the blankets and sheets were dirty...The AC didn't work... The TV didn't work... The Wifi didn't work... The window shades wouldn't pull down...The Windows allowed air to pass through creating a whistle sound the whole night and again no one available to get anything working. They will take your money and from there your on your own. I wouldn't recommend this dump to my worst enemy. BUYER BEWARE!!!,,1,1.0

It would appear that the New Year is prime time to visit Hawaii. After searching TripAdvisor, I came across this place. I read reviews, good and bad, with the main complaint being the elevator. So, reluctantly, I booked it for the one night (not to mention, our $300+ price was cheaper than the almost $1000 price for other places - and there weren't that many choices). First, there is no early check in, even though instructions said you could ask. So, precisely at 4pm, we got in to our room. The TV was on (we figured that was because the remote didn't work most of the time). As I entered the door to the room, I noticed a cabinet door ajar. I went to shut it to keep from hitting my head upon entering. It was open because it wouldn't stay closed. Once we got in to the room, I put one of our bags on the bed. I've seen trampolines with less bounce. And throughout the night, every time one of us moved, it almost launched the other one. Needless to say, we got very little sleep. While looking the place over, I noticed the faucet in the shower leaked. Also, the first time we washed our hands in the bathroom sink, it became apparently clear that it was clogged. It took hours to drain. Also, when I went to throw something away, I discovered the cabinet door hiding the trash can in the ""kitchenette"" was loose and almost fell off (it was being held by one hinge). As for the elevator, I do believe I read reviews from a couple of years back with guests complaining about the elevator ( just how long doesn't take to fix an elevator?). When we checked in, there was one of the two elevators working, so, yes, we had a long wait. Thankfully, we had to leave before sunrise, so the elevator wasn't too much of a problem. Also, since we did leave before sunrise, we discovered that there are no lights in the tight, small parking garage, so you might want to make sure you have a flashlight. We stayed here because there were few choices, but I wonder if we would have been just as comfortable sleeping in our Jeep. ","Lewisburg, Tennessee",55,1.0
