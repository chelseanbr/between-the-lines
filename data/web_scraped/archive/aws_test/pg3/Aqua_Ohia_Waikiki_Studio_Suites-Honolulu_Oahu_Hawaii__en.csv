Once, I stated that I was in the shower and male housekeeper was still at door, so had to stop and open. Worn clothing found at base of bed headboard, and no one cleaned bathroom for 3 weeks. I did. Otherwise, great location, and rooms have balconies. Room price was lowered because of virus lockdown, but tiny parking was still 35+ nightly.","Oahu, Hawaii",0,3.0
