There is a call for it during the coronavirus outbreak. Please don’t be clueless. It’s become the new standard for public places and businesses.,,0,2.0

Well stocked - staff were very friendly. Room was always cleaned.  Had a small problem with our safe and it was fixed about 10 minutes after we had talked to the people at the front desk. Fish Hook Cafe - part of the hotel very good food. Only thing would have been if it had stayed open past 2pm. No restaurant in the hotel for dinner. We were close to other good restaurants. ,"Walkerton, Canada",5,4.0
