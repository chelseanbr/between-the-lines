A front-desk clerk, Lauren, snapped at me on the phone. Note that I am even a HHonors Gold member. . ..At the front desk, I heard that another Hawaii resident got waived for the resort fee (the amenities are closed anyway due to the virus situation) so I asked for the same thing. The manager agreed to waive the fee for this stay only. Because I never used any of the amenities and for being a Hawaii resident, I asked for adjustment of the resort fee to my stay 7 days ago. The manager declined my request. So I headed to my room. The room does not even have an ocean view, even though I am a Gold member. But due to reluctance to bother the staff again, I did not ask to change room. Instead, I unpacked and started a basic cleaning and disinfected the surface areas as I routinely do. Then, I noticed the glass shower door was covered all by streaks of watermarks, looking like it had not been cleaned. The cleaning staff came for a look and said it should not be like that and he would return and handle it. Since I already went over the floor with the disinfecting wipes, I was reluctant to let people in and mess up again. So I told the front desk that I could wipe it myself, given that it is just a one-night stay, but asked again for waiver for the resort fee from last week’s bill. After an hour, I checked again, which was when Lauren started her craziness. She said either the cleaning staff would clean the door or I need to change room. I was saying even that was inconvenience for me since I already unpacked and disinfected the area. But Laurent cut me off and yelled : “No, it is not inconvenience”, “No, there will not be any compensation”, “It was only just A water spot” (that was not true; it was not one water spot; the whole glass door had streaks of watermarks, or calcification of something, or soap scum), “We provided a solution and YOU would not take it”, ……. She has a higher voice and obviously a language advantage over me, an immigrant (she talked much faster than me in the least). The result was that I never got to finish my sentence and was choked effectively. And that set the miserable tone for my stay. Later the cleaning staff came but were not able to remove those calcification marks on the glass door– another first-time finding for me, since I never saw glass shower doors with stains that do not come off after cleaning in other hotels.Cutting people short is impolite even for everyday conversation and Lauren was doing that to a HHonors Gold member paying for the stay. It IS INCONVENIENCE for guests to check in and find that cleaning was not done properly. When I check in, I expect everything taken care of. Lauren single-handedly ruined my stay. The hotel adjusted for the resort fee, but they did not lose anything since I should have been given a lower Kamaaina rate for both stays. The hotel staff just acted as if they did not see my Hawaii ID.",,1,1.0

I appreciate that we were accommodated at the last minute for 15 days. With such a wonderful experience and the messages asking if everything was going fine with our stay. I feel guilty asking about my points and days that don't show on my account. Other than that can't complain about parking everything around is walking distance and the public transportation stops right in front of the hotel for $5.00 you can get a day pass and for $2.75 a one way fare. I rented a car 2 days which I had no problem parking on the street. ,"Laramie, Wyoming",18,4.0

The location in Waikiki is obviously perfect near to everything, the rooms are lovely and well maintained. I highly recommendand will be back in September.","London, United Kingdom",29,5.0
