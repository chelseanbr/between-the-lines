I stayed in two bedroom suite...and upon arrival, room was very worn and in need of updating. Our room was also dirty. So much so, I immediately went to front desk and voiced concern. I provided photos and front desk sent someone up to clean!. Was terribly dust ridden, for $500 a night I expected far better. Once cleaned, things went much better... but room condition not on par with other Embassy Suites. The two best features were the breakfast/pool area and overall location. Breakfast a wonderful experience for family of 5. Pretty much same thing every day but well worth it and good variety. Staff at breakfast wonderful! Every evening also had drinks and snacks...all this included as part of staying with Embassy. Location of hotel adjacent to and connected to Beach Walk on one side, however opposing side of hotel nearly abandoned and run down. Location to Beach just short walk away... maybe one block or so straight ahead on path. Car rental available next door and could return after hours at Embassy for small fee.I would stay again, but not my first choice and currently does not warrant as high a rating as is shown. With remodel...no hesitation... would highly recommend! For comparison, I checked out Trump hotel next door... night and day (Trump elegant and absolutely beautiful), however Trump similar room $1500 per night and no breakfast included, plus very small pool.When I return, I wy check out Embassy again, but if not remodeled... would pass.",Mt Zion IL,26,3.0

First, they had a welcome drink for us when we checked in. Second, we were upgraded to an ocean view room...I think because we have gold status. (I booked the room through Costco Travel.)Third, happy hour was amazing! They had an entire menu of drinks that they served for free every night. Nice Hawaiian drinks too.Fourth, the full breakfast! This not only saved us money, but it’s was a legit full and fresh breakfast. They had two lines, so there’s was never a wait. Fifth, the location! I don’t think I’ll stay anywhere else after staying here and seeing just how central it is to the beach, restaurants, and shopping. Overall, between the amazing customer service, the kind house keepers, and everything listed above, I will return. I will recommend this hotel to there too. I don’t think you can go wring by staying here.  ","Ogden, Utah",12,5.0

Our second time here, and Arriving just after all the coronavirus hysteria surfaced… The governor just announced Hawaii is closing to tourism, and we are so grateful that we made it here in time","Grand Haven, Michigan",145,5.0
