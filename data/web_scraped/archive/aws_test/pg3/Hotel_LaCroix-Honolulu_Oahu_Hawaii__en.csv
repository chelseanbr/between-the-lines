We were greeted immediately upon arrival, served fresh juice and given a traditional Hawaiian welcome with lei's. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was very nice and clean. Normally I get congested from all of the chemicals used in cleaning, however that did not happen in this hotel. Got a great nights sleep and felt very rested. Continental breakfast was awesome! Lots of fruit, juice, eggs, pastries, coffee and tea. Relaxing pool area. Within walking distance of Waikiki and lots of shops adn restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!","Clermont, Florida",24,5.0

Darwin is a great manager and a very nice person, he takes into account every problem or request of the customers, and you're pretty sure he'll do the best to let you enjoy your stay. My girlfriend was so happy (and me too...) for the awesome welcome arranged for her!The structure is pretty nice, near to the sea and to the most popular attractives and restaurants of Waikiki. Then, I'd like also to thank all the staff, in particular Men and the people giving you a smile in the morning at the breakfast, and the guys of the valet and reception, Nikki and every person that take care in such a nice way of the people coming and going. Thank you!","Naples, Italy",5,5.0

Swimming pool a bit small though. Breakfast is very good :) Very clean hotel - special thank you to Mhila who was very nice to us during our stay.,"Manchester, England, United Kingdom",1,5.0
