Always stay at the Moana Surfrider. They have the best location on the beach if you love to surf, standup paddle, snorkel or just swim in the crystal clear water. On top of all that, the staff at the pool side towel desk are the most friendly people we have ever met at any hotel. Gloria is always smiling, Moe is alway friendly and Lee is always ready to tell a joke and gives the best local restaurant recommendations any traveler could ask for. Take my advice and don’t bother looking for anywhere else to stay if you are planning a trip to Waikiki.",,1,5.0
