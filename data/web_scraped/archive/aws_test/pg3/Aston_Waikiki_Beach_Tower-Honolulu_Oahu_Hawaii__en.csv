We are from Australia and we loved our stay. Room was simple clean and we choose the partial ocean view room it was a great view. And pool was great. Free filtered water whenever you want and great location. Shops on the same street, park across the road and beach across the road. Tour buses stop out front. Sounds to good to be true. Staff were lovely. Canâ€™t say this about many hotels but this was a great stay for us. Our room view. ","Mudgee, Australia",0,5.0

Looking forward to our 20th anniversary. It's not inexpensive, but it's a great value. 140 ocean facing suites (my estimate) in a 40 story building with 4 elevators, steps from the beach, makes for a great boutique, condo experience. The staff is the best.","Calgary, Canada",2,5.0

I have stayed at many similarly priced hotels in other cities and never experienced this level of customer support. The staff (front lobby and valet) treated us like family and anticipated every need. They noticed when I ran out of laundry detergent so gave me extra packets for the following day! We loved the personal touch of water bottles and sunscreen along with beach towels that can be checked out for day trips. The suites are large with well stocked kitchens and the housekeeping is flawless. They have set the bar for all future trips!,"Clinton Township, Michigan",0,5.0
