Front office staff, very specially the manager was extremely accomodating. House keeping staff very pleasent and we had a cleaned up room every day of our stay. Great location. The rates were very reasonable .We stayed 6 days on 2 occations during our 2 week stay in Oahu. We were sad to leave, but look forward to returing and staying at the Holiday Surf Hotel any day we return ti the Islands.",,0,5.0

An older hotel, the staff and inside accommodations were far beyond our expectations. From check in to check out, they went above and beyond to make us comfortable and feel at home. Highly recommend this property for anyone that would like to make their stay less expensive than the traditional prices in Waikiki. We will stay with Walter, Patrick and the team there for all future stays in Waikiki.","Duncan, Canada",0,5.0
