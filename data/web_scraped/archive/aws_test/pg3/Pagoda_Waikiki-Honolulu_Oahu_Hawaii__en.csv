Room up a flight of stairs, no lift. Arrived 22.30, just managed to catch a member of staff as they were leaving. No overnight reception. No parking, only 3 metered spaces out on the road limited to 2 hours for $3/hour or free overnight (IF you can get a spot) between 10pm & 6am. Nearest and cheapest overnight parking approx 400 metres away at $20 for 10 - 12 hours.Room was dark and smelled musty. Very basic. Very tired looking. Plenty of cupboards but in disrepair. Ironing board but no iron. No hairdryer. Fridge was useful. Microwave which we never used so unsure if it works. Air con efficient but was extremely noisy. No windows, just dark shutters facing the pool so very noisy especially at night, could hear all the traffic, party goers, people around the pool, bin lorries etc, not conducive to good nights sleep!! Outside the door we overlooked the back of the property which looked like a rubbish tip...old mattresses, skips etc. The bathroom toilet seat was loose, mould around the sink, shower was hot and powerful which was good. There was no room service unless you pay extra, so our towels were never changed and bin never emptied the whole 5 days, although, having a skip at the back meant we just tossed the trash over the balcony and it landed in the skip! The bed was comfortable.There is a 7 eleven over the road which is good, itâ€™s where we got our morning coffee and pastry. They sell microwaveable food as well as fruit and a selection of Asian food.Staff were polite.Would we stay there again? Definitely NO!",,2,2.0

We got 6 days in the Dirty , Smelly, Black Mold. The bathroom smells like Urine. The shower so bad. When I complained was told it was a 10$ fee for house cleaning WT....? I think jail would have been cleaner. The only bright side is location. I would only recommend to my worst enemy. Maybe not even!!!December 2019","Yuma, Arizona",0,1.0

I found on airbnb which I didn't think was a hotel, no one seemed to write a bad review. The hotel is dated, unkept, paint peeling off the door frames and ceiling, security latch busted on door, left over shampoo on shower wall, chipped cabinets, our ice bucket was given to us as a garbage bag. security light blared in window all night, exterior wall was only screen except top two feet, could hear everyone outside, location great bed comfy but the rest didn't impress. luckily only stayed one night.","St. Helena, California",4,1.0
