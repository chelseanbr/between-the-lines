It fronts Oahu’s best beach...where I believe only Ali’i we’re allowed to swim and surf. The hotel service from valet, bellman and front desk is excellent. Friendly locals welcome you wholeheartedly (been there when busy and still the same service). Food at the voyager club (takeout) is not only delicious but prices were moderate. The squash tacos and burgers were yummy. The smoothie shack was also great, their smoothies and bowls delish too! As for now the beach is without crowds, YET honu (turtles) float casually, and the fish are swimming happily amongst those in the water! If you’re able to visit, I’d go now!","Kailua, Hawaii",2,5.0

Was very disappointed. This hotel needs a face lift and updating. It has an 80's feel. The pool area is very small and the beach is very crowded. Very over priced for what you get. We arrived in Hawaii on our way home from Singapore where we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands which was an awesome experience. We ate at Duke's once for dinner. It was okay but again very crowded. I would suggest heading over to the mall across the street where there are several nice and relaxing restaurants.,"Denver, NC",45,3.0

If you want a view of the sea you need rooms Oceanfront, other Ocean View rooms have only side views, partly shaded by other hotels. Oceanfront rooms offer a fantastic view of the whole beach and Diamond Head. The hotel has its own swimming pool with sun loungers, and 2 restaurants overlooking the beach. The hotel is a short walk from the center, close to many restaurants and shops. The perfect hotel for your holiday.",Brno,6,5.0
