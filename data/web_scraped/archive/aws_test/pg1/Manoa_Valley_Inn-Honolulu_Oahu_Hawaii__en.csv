If that doesn't appeal to you, the Manoa Valley Inn offers a pleasant and affordable alternative. It's an historic property that's an island of green in an otherwise unremarkable area two blocks from the University of Hawaii. Breakfast was excellent, and was served on a lovely terrace that's nearly overgrown with orchards and other plants. There's a garden area and pool in the back as well, though they're not well cared for. As B&B's go, Manova Valley has some shortcomings. Parking is very tight, so don't arrive in a Hummer and hog a space and a half. The room we had was nice enough and big enough for two, and it had a good bed. But the furnishings were well-worn and the shower/bath was substandard. The on-site management owns friendly dogs and they (the dogs) show up from time to time, which I personally didn't care for. The Inn is walking distance to the University but not much else, so finding good restaurants nearby where you can also park is a real challenge (and a common problem throughout Honolulu). I'm glad we chose this over the Waikiki skyscrapers, but Manoa Valley could use some attention to make it a first-rate B&B experience.",,1,4.0

There were dogs in the public spaces.There was a definite smell of dog urine in the porch area. The area did not look like pictures. We left but were given a refund. My only reason for giving it a poor not terrible rating,"Sarasota, Florida",2,2.0

It is very near the University of Hawaii, not far from Waikiki and close to restaurants. The gardens and pool are beautiful and a nice peaceful place in the midst of a busy city. The innkeepers were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent. Our room was comfortable and air conditioned, which helped in the hot summer weather. We would definitely stay here again if we visit Honolulu in the future.",,2,4.0
