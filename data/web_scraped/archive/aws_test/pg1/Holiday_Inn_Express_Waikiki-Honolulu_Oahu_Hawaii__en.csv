We checked out early to go to an early morning event, only to find out that it had been cancelled. The hotel was very accomdating with holding our luggage and providing us a place to shower and change even after we had checked out. The concierge was also very helpful in planning events. The only thing is if you're in Hawaii it'll be expensive! Very great service, everyone was always very friendly and helpful at all times! Breakfast was also very nice with plenty of options! Great choice for your money!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin",1,5.0

Before we even planned going to Honolulu, I have searched for a reasonable hotel with good rating and breakfast included. And this was it. I joined us for their club member rate. It’s basically the same as local rates and senior rates. Except these one, we’ll earn points. We got to the hotel, went straight to the parking lot on 2nd floor. Bring the parking ticket and head to Lobby. They will validate the ticket so you can leave anytime just place the barcode into the machine and the next time you come back, they see your car plate number in the camera, they just open. Parking fee was expensive though, $35 plus tax a day. Our room was great. We stayed at the 33rd floor and the wind was howling all the time. If you’re don’t mind it, it’s fine. If not, request for lower floors. The view was great too. Breakfast was awesome. Plenty of tables. Good selection of items. Staffs were so nice. Everyone were very friendly and helpful. We love it. Next time we come back Honolulu. We’re staying here again. Highly recommended!!!",,26,5.0

But we are disappointed that the Jacuzzi is cold. We asked 3days in a row for them to heat it to only find out that this has been a on going issue. Which would have been nice to know instead being told we will reset it and our evening routine of changing clothes and heading to the hot tub, only to find it’s still ice cold. Fix the heater! We are on vacation we want to soak before bed!","Santa Clarita, California",1,3.0
