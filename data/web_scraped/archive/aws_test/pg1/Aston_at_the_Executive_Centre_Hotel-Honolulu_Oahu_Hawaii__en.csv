The lobby area is nice along with nice views from the upper floors. There is also a good number of shopping and eating options in the area, and even within a very easy walk to McD's and Walmart. Parking is available but is a bit of a pain to access as you have to change elevators to access floors 3-9 which is the parking areas. It is also can get quite costly at about $20 a day.Now the bad, the Apt we stayed in was decently clean, had a decent bed, but the rest of the furniture and accommodations were cheap. Even the kitchen utensils, silverware, and cookware were pathetic. Since I have now found out these are condo units and owned by individuals, I guess it makes sense that some are better than others. This room wasn't terrible but it could definitely use some upgrades.This is downtown, so after about 6 pm all the business people are gone and all that is left is the homeless and they are EVERYWHERE. Not the fault of the hotel but Oahu has a serious homeless problem and it shows, in this area, at night.","Huntsville, Alabama",120,3.0

The room smelled and the furniture was outdated and old. Turns out it is a Time-share room which I was not informed of at any stage, thus the lived in smell!! We were moved the following day to another room,better view but still SMELLED! Bed(s) were old and uncormfortable. All in all, a very poor start to our vacation. The restaurnat in the lobby doesnt even belong to the hotel either. Overall, not as advertised, expensive for what is on offer, and no contact with management either during or subsequent to the fiasco. The front staff were very nice and tied to help in a situation that obvioulsy they have no control over.",,0,1.0

Narrow hallways, low ceilings, smelled, no quality to the rooms. The location was not good. The Waikiki Beach area is amazing, great shopping, restaurants, night life, landscape, etc. Stay anywhere near Waikiki Beach.",,2,2.0
