The heritage wing is nostalgic, the rooms don’t offer balconies and showing some age. The newer section offers brighter more upbeat accommodations with balconies and wraparound balconies in corner rooms. The best proximity in Waikiki. ","Oak Brook, Illinois",272,4.0

The grounds around the property are a lush green oasis of calm and adds to the exclusivity. The hotel location can not be beaten - it’s got the best part of the beach, and outside you’re right in the middle of the shopping area. The resort fee includes portable Wifi hire - perfect for using while out exploring the island. The hotel Wifi is free and super-fast (70-90mbps).Beds are very comfortable and the linens are top quality Frette. Toiletries are gorgeous organic Mālie. Mailani Tower:The building is a 70’s concrete construction, but the views they offer are unparalleled. Beach, palm trees, surf & surfers - Iconic Hawaii - this is what you’re paying extra for at the Mailani Tower. We also loved hearing the sound of the ocean - so soothing. ***Tip: It’s also definitely worth paying a bit extra for a high floor!The rooms are a mix of tired-traditional and faded-modern decor. The air conditioning units are old and clunky and loud - you can’t sleep with it on, even on low it’s noisy. Bathrooms are very dated and the over-tub shower isn’t the best - not what you’d expect from a top hotel.No blockout blinds or curtains - just sliding louver shutters which let in the morning light so no sleeping late allowed here. The Mailani Lounge provides a complimentary “light” breakfast in the mornings, and also a happy (2.5) hour for drinks and nibbles in the evening. The lounge was never packed during these hours- always seating available. Service was super friendly too. There is a coffee machine in the lounge too and this is available for use though the day and evening. Traditional wing:The original part of the hotel is absolutely stunning- wide open spaces with high ceiling and beautiful architectural features, and all beautifully maintained. The room doors are original heavy carved wood, the hallway carpet are gorgeous pattered. Rooms are spacious with lots of natural light - we were given a room on the 6th floor. Curtains are black-out so great for the mornings. Beds are much more comfortable than the Mailani Tower too. Bathrooms have a modern shower cubicle and the shower is excellent. We loved our stay at this historic beauty, knows as The Pink Palace of the Pacific. ","Melbourne, Australia",174,5.0
