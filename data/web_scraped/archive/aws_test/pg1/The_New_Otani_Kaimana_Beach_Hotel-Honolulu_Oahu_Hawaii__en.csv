The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable with a good bed and a great balcony with a clear view of Diamond Head crater. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. The WiFi is good. The location is very good because it is far enough away from Waikiki and Honolulu to be peaceful, but just a short walk to both those places. We walked to Diamond Head crater from here to do the Diamond Head crater walk. We found the breakfast at Hau Tree Lanai to be quite expensive, so recommend a short walk along the foreshore towards Waikiki for any meal at Barefoot Beach Cafe. This became our favourite place to eat. The beach is 60 seconds away and Kapiolani Park is across the road. Fantastic location. It was also fun to get something to eat and a few beers from the ABC Store and sit on the balcony with Diamond Head as a companion. We will definitely be back.","Sydney, Australia",27,5.0

I had one of the lower priced rooms as that was all I needed as a solo traveler (room 724), and below $200.00 a night, which is a relative bargain in this area. Although the hotel is not actually ""in"" Waikiki, it's an easy 20 minute or so walk to the center of it all. I love the location as it is never rushed, crowded or hurried, and their beach is never crowded and very nice. Clean room, high floor, with lanai and views of the water and Diamond head, if you looked out over the railing.The oceanfront rooms are a good deal ....the corner rooms with a view of Waikiki and the Pacific are the best deal if you can get one. Check out the website for more info.The Hau Tree restaurant is well known among the locals, but I prefer the Miyako Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor - (ck at check-in for discounts!).If you really want to go ""budget style"", there is a well stocked convenience store on the property that has just about everything from papayas, sandwiches to alcohol, to every necessity you might need.I guess you can tell I like it here!Happy trails,conrad","Wilton, New York",7,4.0

In Oahu, we always stayed in Hilton Hawaiian Village (mostly staying an ocean front unit facing the ocean. Everything was ok but increasingly became tired of 'madness' around the Hilton (too many people in a rather small area, hard to get a desired unit, expensive if you want a good view, a lack of really good restaurants without paying a lot) we decided to try this boutique hotel at the opposite end of Waikiki. We had the ocean front/Waikiki unit that looked the Pacific Ocean and the entire Waikiki sky line. Yes the hotel is generally a bit old, but the room was nicely renovated and really really clean. The view from the unit was spectacular (the view after dark is special), far better than any view that we ever had in Hilton. Also the atmosphere of the hotel and surrounding were so calm and resting, you can breeze. Beach was small but not crowded compered to the rest of Waikiki beach. It is close to the Zoo and Aquarium (waking distance) and Diamond head park. Also the neighborhood was surrounded by multimillion dollar houses. There are two excellent restaurants, a Japanese restaurant and Haute Tree Lani restaurant, both of which serve excellent food. Also if you like busy, loud, and 'exciting' shops/night clubs and restaurants along Waikiki beach, you could walk less than a mile.to get there. ","Houston, Texas",74,5.0
