We have been staying at this hotel for over 21 years. It’s clean, comfortable and most importantly the staff has been there for just as long. There’s parking that’s not an outrageous price. Love the staff. Love the hotel. ","Hilo, Hawaii",0,5.0

She was the same on another ocassion when we tried to give back a letter that we thought was mistakenly give to us (i called the number on the paper left in our room and it was for other guest which promt us to give the letter back) and she kept trying to talk over me and felt like she was annoyed at us. She wasnt accomodating at all so i just let her talk and talk. As guests we shouldnt have to feel that way. However the rooms were clean and spacious and other staff were welcoming and eady ti talk to. It is located close to Ala moana and abit of a walk to waikiki, we hired a car and cost us $23 after joining the membership otherwise $28.The carpets might need abit of cleaning especially the hallways. Otherwise we would stay again. Customer service by Bo could be improved","Sydney, Australia",9,3.0
