It is on the edge of the strip bordered by the beach in front and the zoo on one side. I did not pay extra for the ocean view but still had a fabulous view of the beach. The safe was pleasant and helpful. If you are looking for a comfortable but more barebones hotel this is a great option.,,6,4.0

Gorgeous view and nice location at a decent nightly rate (but do remember to include the resort fee). Some commenters have mentioned the need for room refurbishment, but that didn’t bother me much. The furniture is okay, and room is very clean. My problem is that the street noise and live music at Tiki’s are LOUD. My room was on the 8th floor. The musician played until 11pm, which isn’t unusual for bars and restaurants... except my east coast body clock wanted to sleep at 9pm. The street noise and urban campers across the street did not quiet down when the music stopped. I was awaken to yelling and banging multiple times each night. A trade off for the view of the Waikiki beach and sunset.The staff here is wonderful, and I will probably stay here again, but next time I will definitely request a very high floor.","Atlanta, Georgia",5,4.0

For $7 a night we were able to upgrade to an oceanfront view rather than ocean view. No brainer! We overlooked the main beach right across the street from the hotel. The location is at the end of the waikiki main drag, so its quieter than many properties, but still within walking distance of everything. The zoo is right across the street, the aquarium is beyond that, and Diamond Head is also adjacent with a nice public park. We loved the security feature of having to scan your room card to get on one of the elevators. The pool is next to the reception area as is a restaurant. The staff brought us frozen fruit cups while we were sitting in the chairs. They also supply you with beach towels and i believe beach chairs, but we didn't use them. The bed was comfy and the room was large. We were able to pay for late checkout at 4 pm since our room was going to be empty. We had a late flight and the hotel has a place to store luggage if you dont have a car and want to hang around town for a while. Valet parking is mandatory if you have a car. Our car was available whenever we wanted it by calling the valet desk. The only thing we can say negative was the lines at check-in and checkout. They need to get more staff during those times, or upgrade their systems to work faster. We got tired of waiting to check out after 10 minutes and dropped our key in a box. They did email us a receipt after i sent them a request. We would definitely stay here again!",,5,5.0
