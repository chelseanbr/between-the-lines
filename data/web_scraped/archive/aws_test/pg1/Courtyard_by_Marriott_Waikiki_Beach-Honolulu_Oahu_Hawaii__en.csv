Additionally, the restaurant closed down without notice, even after we had paid in advance for breakfast.Also, to get to our hotel wing, we had to walk through clouds of cigarette smoke right past the designated smoking area.","Canberra, Australia",0,2.0

It was an easily available spot for tour pickup buses. The rooms were always cleaned and the staff was friendly and helpful all t he time. ,"Brooksville, Florida",9,5.0

When we checked in we were advised we had been allocated a high floor room on the pool side of hotel but what we were not told is renovations were being carried out so our view was of the painters working on a swinging stage right outside our room. We had to keep our curtains closed at all times and the only ones to enjoy our balcony were the painters who used it for their lunch venue. The room was old and outdated with the smallest shower we have ever seen. What really surprised us was we were on the elite level of the hotel but anyone who has ever stayed at a Marriott property would realise there is nothing elite about what is provided here. My advice is if you are thinking of booking for your honeymoon or first trip to Hawaii stay somewhere else. We paid around 300 aud per night but for what we got would have been disappointed paying half that.,,0,1.0
