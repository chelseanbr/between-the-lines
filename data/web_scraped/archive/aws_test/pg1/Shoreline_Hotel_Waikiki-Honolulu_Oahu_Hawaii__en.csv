Because of this, some services were limited or suspended at the hotel and surrounding establishments.Most importantly I would stay again.My room was comfortable and sitting out on the balcony to eat my meals or just relax after an outing was very nice. You can see the ocean from the roof top pool or the mountains north of the hotel. The hotel was a clean and vibrant colored establishment.The location was great!You're approximately 2 city blocks from the beach and surrounded by food spots and shopping like Ross (literally across the street) to the trendy high end ""i spent it cause i have it"" shops like Jimmy Choo and Coach.Even though things were different than usual, the service I received was solid. Cheyne was my first contact when I valeted my car. He was welcoming and answered all my questions about rates and what to expect while leaving my car with him. April checked me in and was very sweet and soft spoken. I also ate breakfast at the onsite restaurant take out only and was pleasantly pleased.I would suggest the hotel this hotel to others. It was clean. I felt safe. The location was great and service from staff met my standards.","Boston, Massachusetts",0,5.0

I would definitely stay again in the future. While not directly on the beach it is literally a 5 minute walk and in the heart of Waikiki. The cost of this hotel is so reasonable for its location. The staff is very helpful, the rooms are large and clean and it has a rooftop pool with a great view.Thank you Shoreline for a great stay!","Paradise, Michigan",2,5.0

The only reason I would come back is for Cheyne. The experience was amazing.",,0,5.0
