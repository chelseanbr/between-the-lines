Rooms were dirty, and couldn’t even fit an open suitcase on the floor. The pool is terrible, don’t be fooled by the photos on the website, it looks bigger and nicer online. We asked if we could pay for an upgraded room because the one we were given was horrible, and we had just got engaged, however they wouldn’t let us change rooms. Long walk to Waikiki, with nil access to free shuttles. For the same price/ cheaper you can stay at Ohana East on wakikki, which is in a better location, bigger and nicer rooms and beds and includes free shuttles to Ala Moana.If you are a young couple or family (especially from Australia) please do not stay here.","Anaheim, California",0,1.0

When I got here they told me for the first time ever that my room was subcontracted so I could not ask for amenities. They gave me a 24 hours service number. Fine, but the service number is not 24 hours. It is closed and if you contact them they take 72 hours to respond. I need a blanket right now. This room has no blanket and because of the pandemic all the stores nearby are closed and I can't even go out and buy one. Another thing is that the so-called concierge told me the beach ACROSS THE STREET was closed only to cars but not individuals. How could he not know what the main attraction of the hotel was? I went there and of course it was closed to individuals. The security kicked me out right away. Why did this hotel concierge not know such a basic thing?  I just checked in so who knows what other weird things I will encounter.","Oslo, Norway",6,1.0
