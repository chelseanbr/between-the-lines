It is a secret gem...dont miss it. It is close to all things Waikiki. The staff is great and the food is very different. The noodle house across the street is world class.,"Arcadia, California",0,5.0

All this owing to the well-designed property and the hospitality of the management team. I was upgraded to a very nice , well-appointed and spacious room on the 15th floor. Whole-panel floor-to-Ceiling window, modern and stylish room design with wide open areas, light-colored carpet and bright-colored furniture (all in excellent condition), looking exactly like the picture at the hotel's website. The room is stark contrast to many of those tiny Waikiki hotel rooms with glum dark-colored carpet and old smelly furniture. Staff were super polite, efficient and professional and appreciated local residents. Bed is indeed on the soft side but still OK. The only problem was that a door handle fell when I tried to close the door; luckily it didn't cause any damage.",,1,5.0

But Laylow was good - its modern and at a really good location. Its close to this really yummy Masubi takeaway shop and also walking distance to the main shopping street.I would stay here again!Service was really good, vibe in general was good too.","Los Angeles, California",0,4.0
