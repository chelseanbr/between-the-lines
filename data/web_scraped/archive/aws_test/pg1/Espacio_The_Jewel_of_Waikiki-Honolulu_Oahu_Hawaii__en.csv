From the moment I arrived to the time I departed, the entire staff provided a seamless experience that left me impressed over and over again. The hotel’s butler, Wesley, was more thoughtful than I could have imagined, arranging an incredible in-room breakfast that delivered on even the smallest of my preferences. Then there are the rooms – expansive suites that cover an entire floor complete with a roomy private balcony and outdoor Jacuzzi. I woke up to the most incredible view of Waikiki Beach. It’s amazing how you can feel so relaxed and at peace while situated in the middle an incredible, cosmopolitan city. Don’t miss the rooftop infinity pool (there is a spa on the same level) and onsite dining at Mugen – all very worthy of a visit. , I’ve never been to a hotel with more thoughtful, personalized service and amenities. Considering there are only 9 rooms, I feel very lucky to have secured a reservation and can’t wait to come back.",,0,5.0

Really odd set up. Basic apartment building entrance. Lots of people downstairs but nobody could show lobby. Then lobby not open. Pretty sure all the positive reviews are PR bluff. Definitely not high end service so flagged and back to Halekulani, which is ok but not amazing rooms. Note Espacio also has one of those Israeli? moisturiser brand salesmen hawking outside. All together seems a bit low rent. ","Auckland Central, New Zealand",57,3.0
