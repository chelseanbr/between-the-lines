I travel for work so convenience is key. The hotel is very clean and the staff is incredible. I was there for 14 days last time and this time so got familiar worth the staff. Personally J and Massimo were great, spent my evenings at the hotel bar enjoying great conversations and music! The only things that are a bummer is the expensive resort fee and valet charge.

Ocean rooms have a fantastic view and good room size. No bath in our room unfortunately. Only downside would be the Executive Lounge which is located in the basement, so your literally eating in a bunker with no view. Breakfast choices are stuck back in the 1970s, and there really is nothing executive about the experience. It seems a waste to have executive customers dining there when you have such incredible views to take advantage of.","Tokyo, Japan",1,3.0

This is an expensive area, overall but we found excellent rates for the proximity to the beach. I assumed it was because the hotel would be older but it’s very modern and nice. It did not have an outdoor pool but I didn’t care about that. My key card always worked, which I greatly appreciated. The in-house food options are perfect—multiple options and convenient. The room was spacious and comfortable. ","Seattle, Washington",1,5.0
