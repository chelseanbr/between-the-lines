It was a very comfortable, clean room, that offered all the basic amenities. However, if you're looking for gigantic pools with pool parties, and crowded bars, that's not what you'll find. The hotel has a pool (but mostly for exercising and relaxing), and a restaurant for relaxing as well.","Los Angeles, California",28,5.0

My daughter tagged along to advantage of the opportunity to enjoy the island. Great location adjacent to, but not a victim to, the crush of Waikiki Beach. Once we parked, we walked everywhere else. Our room was more spacious than expected, well maintained and clean. Solid WiFi allowed her to ""telework"". Bathroom was perfect. Mandatory valet parking on par with NYC prices but access much more convenient. Valets were professional and efficient. Small but functional gym with free weights, weight machine, treadmills (2), and elliptical (2). Only disappointment was the breakfast menu and its price point. Recommend skip the hotel fare for something outside the hotel.","Vienna, Virginia",30,4.0

My elderly Aunty didn’t have to walk too far to get anywhere which we were certainly grateful for. I also appreciated the fitness Center that was available when we got back late at night - we definitely made use of that! Breakfasts were great - we had the continental and the hot breakfast - what a bargain! I would definitely stay here again. ,,0,5.0
