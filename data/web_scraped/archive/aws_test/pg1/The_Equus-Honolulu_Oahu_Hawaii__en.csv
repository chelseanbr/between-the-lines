For the price, the hotel is very comfortable and quaint! The customer service was GREAT!! We especially appreciated Lincoln who worked for the valet. He always greeted us with a smile and cheerful attitude. He was awesome at giving us suggestions on what to do and where to go. Thank you Equus for making sure we were taken care of while visiting Honolulu.",,0,4.0

I read all the reviews from terrible to excellent. Usually if there are any terrible reviews, I choose something else. The excellent reviews kept luring me back to The Equus Hotel. We arrived late at night and we got to our room, I realized that the terrible reviews had some merit. The room was tired and had some cleanliness issues. We spoke to Chad at the front desk and he was very helpful in finding us a beautiful suite in the hotel. It did have some street noise, but was very comfortable. The next morning we spoke to Rene at the front desk. She was the best!! We were put into a quiet room down the hall and Linelle had it sparkling and smelling fresh! Unfortunately, we didn't get Linelle cleaning our room after that and there were a few issues with towel and glass changes. The staff was great at making the situation better and we had a good stay while vacationing in Honolulu!","Saskatoon, Canada",1,3.0

I was happy and satisfied with my room. It was very clean and spotless. The Housekeeping staff was very friendly. I was happy to run into Linelle. She greeted and welcomed me and asked me if I needed anything to let her know. Thank you Linelle for going out of your way and making my experience an Unforgettable one. Keep up the great work and continue doing what you do at your best!,,0,5.0
