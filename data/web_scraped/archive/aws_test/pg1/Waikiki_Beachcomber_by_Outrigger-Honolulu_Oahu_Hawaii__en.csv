We had not read up on what we wanted to do. we listened to her and choose some trips .  the two other chooses were great but when we lounged a complaint she would not do anything about it  we tried to get her to get us a refund and also she had misinformed us about the limo cost stating it was part of the deal. It was not as per broucher. We found she had given us false information regarding the email addressee of the company involved.. So have not been able to take our complanit any further ,"Taupo, New Zealand",8,4.0

The rooms were tastefully decorated and quite large. We asked for a partial ocean view and that is what we got. The people at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. Check in and out was smooth and efficient. We really enjoyed the pool. The location was greatâ€”just minutes from the beach and right next door to the new International Marketplace. I would definitely recommend this hotel. ,"Salmon Arm, Canada",4,4.0
