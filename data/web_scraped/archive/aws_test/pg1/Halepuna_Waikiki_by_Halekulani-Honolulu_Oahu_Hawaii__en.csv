Cleanliness and Service is second to none.Loved being so close to a less crowded beach and also walking distance to main shopping precinct. The staff went out of their way to accomodate us especially with early check in as we had a long flight. Everyone so friendly and look out for Keaton and Karine on breakfast duty.,,0,5.0

Let me start by saying that I am normally paralyzed with options and I usually give myself a headache from too many reviews. If you are anything like me, I’ll make your life really easy- just book this hotel! You will not regret it. LOCATION: It is located right behind Sheraton and the sister hotel Halekulani. There is an easy beach access right across the street. There are a ton of restaurants and food options within walking distance. Trolley station is also across the street, a less than 5 minute walk. We only needed a car rental for two out of our 5 day stay and rented from hertz on Lewers street around the block. Highly recommend going to north shore and Haleiwa town to get a feel for real Hawaii, as Waikiki can be very touristy. I also think that the side of Waikiki that Halepuna is on is far superior than the opposite side; it was cleaner, restaurants were better, etc. i only say that because were initially booked at the Hyatt, and after passing it by I’m SO HAPPY we switched . We had a city view room which faced the pool and the Sheraton, and also gave us a glimpse of the ocean. Idk why people get so bent outta shape i read reviews about the construction in the street but let’s be honest if you are gonna stay in a busy area like Waikiki don’t expect to hear crickets at night. If that’s the experience you want you should book a little shack in the north shore.FOOD: our family, especially my husband, loves breakfast. This buffet, which was included in our hotel package did not disappoint! Omelet station, pancake and waffle ( and mochi waffles) and a full spread of options were impeccable! Fresh pastries, fruit , and rice a miso soup were just a few of the options. There were Japanese and European influences, and you can tell the food is very high quality. If you happen to order from the pool menu the burger with the taro bun is huge and really tasty.STAFF/AMENITIES: okay . TOTO toilets are the standard in this hotel. And if you haven’t had the glorious experience of sitting in this luxurious throne, you aren’t living your best life. The rooms have high quality bedding. We had a city view room but our lanai which was really tiny still gave us a view of the ocean! The ocean view rooms are definitely beautiful too. The hotel provides an insulated beach bag, with towels and water for your daily excursions. The room has a small fridge, electric water kettle and keurig coffee maker. There is even a self laundry area , so bring travel sized detergent if you plan to use it. The pool is awesome it is warmed to 85 degrees and the infinity pool is so gorgeous, providing a beautiful view of Waikiki beach. It’s not your typical resort pool- it was not crowded...and like the entire hotel, it is immaculate. They even provided sunscreen! The staff on the premises were so attentive and friendly. Keaton and Karine went above and beyond and made us feel like family . There is even a managers welcome reception on fridays where they serve complimentary tapas and drinks! This hotel experience has truly changed the way we travel. We wouldn’t hesitate to come back again!!",,1,5.0

It’s located a few feet from the ocean and right next to Sheraton and the sister property Halekulani. The check in process didn’t start off right but the manager stepped in and we were upgraded to a Mountain View. The rooms are modern, they recently renovated the property. The view was awesome. The room was clean, bed very comfortable. Complimentary bottled water and Keurig in room. Fridge in the room was a plus. Housekeeping checked on us every night to replenish water, empty trash or pick up dirty linen. The shower and the Toto toilet were fabulous.( I might just get me one of those toilets)The breakfast buffet was delicious, many choices to choose from and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Food was seasoned well and the omelettes were so good!!!!We had a late night flight and they extended our check out time and also gave us access to the room on the 8th floor to freshen up and relax. WOW!!!!Overall I enjoyed my stay and highly recommend it. The manager was very friendly and attentive to our needs.Location is a plus. Will definitely be back!","Los Angeles, California",12,5.0
