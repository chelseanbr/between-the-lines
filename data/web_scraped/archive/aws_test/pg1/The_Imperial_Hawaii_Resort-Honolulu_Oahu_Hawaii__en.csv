Wonderful staff and in a great location, close to many restaurants and just a block away from the beach. Rooms very clean and spacious. Highly recommend the Palm Suite, it easily has plenty of room for 3-4 people.",,3,5.0

The best feature was the Island Deli in the back of the ABC store. Do check it out.The bad. Had a room on the 4th floor facing a parking garage and the roar of it's large ventilation fans. The bathroom was tiny and hasn't been updated in many years. Judging by the layout this 1 bdrom unit may have been 2 motel units at one time. The living (?) area had a murpfy bed, dresser, couch, dining table w/4 chairs and a kitchenette. A lack of outlets and desk required me to move the dining table to the murpfy bed area in order to work on my computer.Stayed here 2 weeks as a timeshare exchange. Maybe that is why I got a lower class room. Due to flight changes I needed one extra day lodging. Front desk quoted me an owners rate for that pathetic room of $210 for one night. Could have booked online for $150. Decided to go elsewhere. Thermostat for each rm was old style and difficult to find a sweet spot for temp.This place brags that it is close to Waikiki Beach. Maybe if you could fly over the other hotels. In reality there is a bit of a walk. Lots of street noise.","Traverse City, Michigan",285,2.0

Itâ€™s nothing fancy but the room was clean and the staff helpful and friendly. The location is very convenient to the beach, shopping and restaurants. We loved Nahe at the front desk. She always had a big smile and a friendly hello. We would stay at this timeshare again for sure. ","Saskatoon, Canada",5,4.0
