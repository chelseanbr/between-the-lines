I liked the convenience of the location and that there was a restaurant in the building. All the rooms have a balcony and a view of the canal. The hotel is in the heart of Waikiki. The gym is run down and needs work. The pool and hot tub is a perk and a high light. There is free parking on the street and valet at the hotel. It is hard to get the free parking on the street but its possible. ,"Queens, New York",17,4.0

The Ala Wai canal is very walkable and just across the street. Staff is friendly and helpful. Hotel could use a bit of fresh paint. Stores and restaurants are nearby. Bus stops are conveniently a block away. There is a secluded 70' pool, nice jacuzzi, and foot spa. The hotel supplies hand soap,shampoo, and body wash from soap dispensers. Bring your own bar soap, if you are particular about your shampoo bring your own. Don't forget your conditioner. Hotel has a bar plus a restaurant. When we've seen resort fees from $17 to $50/day at other hotels, this great hotel chooses not to charge a resort fee--a refreshing change!","Vista, California",104,5.0

Pool and hot tub are available for hotel guests until 9pm, and the foot spa is open until midnight. Free breakfast is something that is almost unheard of in Waikiki, so that is an added bonus. Coffee is great! If booked directly through them, car parking is half priced, and if booked 4 nights or longer, free shuttle to and from the airport. Think i have found my new go to hotel when on island.",,0,4.0
