Location is not bad, a lot of nice small eating place and every place is walkable. just a little scary on the other side of the street. There was a little hotel or apt that we noticed that police is always there bec people are always hanging out.",,0,4.0

Soon after,we were in our 21st floor junior suite,absolutely worth the extra money we spent on it. Large and inviting, lots of windows (we could spot Diamond Head and the ocean!!),and enormous walk-in shower and walk-in closet,armchair and a looong sofa … RELAX , here we come!!We also found a pleasant surprise:the WELCOME wishes from the staff (as we were celebrating our 45 wedding anniversary) : towel swans and chocolates made our evening!!It was so convenient to start the day with Vive exceptional buffet breakfast,all you can see in the pictures is true … and you get some more, like those yummy croissants with pineapple and hot dog inside or the soft cheese omelettes. One of the attendant,Kathleen (maybe Kaileen) , was always smiling,while making sure that guests had all they needed,she even helped me with my toasted bread!The lounge had plenty of room for everyone to enjoy breakfast, or, during the day, to relax in an comfy armchair with refreshing flavoured water ...or a cup of complimentary coffee or tea or chamomile. Everything at Vive hotel is well maintained and sparkling clean,all the staff is very committed and myself and husband really want to extend a big THANK YOU to each and everyone.The only (small) flaw is that a couple of days our room was not cleaned. I suspect that this was due to a malfunctioning of the very sophisticated in-room tablet, where you were able to “program” the requested time for your room cleaning. As a matter of fact ,if you were programming the room cleaning at (e.g.) 11:00 AM, at 11:05 a message was automatically generated by the system, informing us that the room was cleaned … but actually it wasn’t. I assume that this message was “marking” the room as “cleaned” in the housekeeping database, so actually they didn’t come to the room anymore. This happened twice, so it’s more than a suspect … no need to say that we avoided to use the tablet the following days and the room was perfectly cleaned per our request. It’s worth to note that, the day after the missed cleaning, we found a nice “Forgive us” card and gift in the room. Agatha ,from housekeeping,always left us fresh towels, all necessary toillet items and a sparkling clean bathroom; bedroom linens were changed every day, all in our room was immaculate!The hotel is just steps away from Waikiki Beach,but at the same time so far from the hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Avenue,it was our little Hawai’ian paradise in the middle of Waikiki.Can I say more ? YES, we are planning to be back asap!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",United States,325,5.0
