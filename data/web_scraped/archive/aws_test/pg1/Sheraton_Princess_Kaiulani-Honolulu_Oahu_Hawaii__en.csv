This is was not the staffs fault what so ever though! My card was being declined because of the purchase being too great, and there wasn't much I could do because my bank was already closed at this point (I live in SC, it was like Midnight there by the time we arrived for check in). I have major anxiety and after the 15 hour flight day, I was exhausted and an a panic attack was bound to happen at the smallest inconvenience. The staff there was extremely patient with me through my breathing exercises and though I felt like the worst kind of guest to have they never once treated me as such (and I know just how ""fun"" it is to work with a crying customer lol). Once all of that was done and we were finally checked in the room itself was very nice! It was a pretty standard hotel room. Two Queen beds, mini fridge, bathroom ect. But the VIEW was amazing! From our room we would see both the Diamond Head AND Waikiki Beach! Since our clocks were way off we were awake to see the sunrise almost every single day we were there. It was honestly breathtaking. Every day the beds were made, towels replaced, and some goodies left of us on the counter. The house keepers even went as far as to fold some of the cloths we'd left laying around! A bit unusual, but appreciated none the less as I'd never had a place fold our clothes before!We got breakfast vouchers with our room for each morning. The breakfast buffet was a favorite of ours! Each morning we'd go down and be seated with a fresh cup of coffee ready for us. There was just something really nice about sitting in the fresh air with a nice cup of joe to start the day. The buffet had a wide variety of fruits, soups (Yes, SOUP), rice, fish, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal, juice bar, and even an omelet and waffle OR pancake station. Really it had all the works.The Splash Bar was a good place to relax after our days. The drinks they served were *chefs kiss* (this is internet slang for amazing). The Lava Flow was my go to. It was basically just a sugar slushie with some coconut rum in it but dang it was good. They also served food at the Splash Bar too, my favorite of which was the coconut shrimp. I must have had that shrimp at least 4 times while we were staying there. It was so tasty it stopped me from wanting to to other restaurants!Our check out was at 10am but we weren't going to be picked up to leave the island until around 3pm. The front desk let us check our bags for free so we didn't have to carry them around. Since we didn't have our bags we were able to roam the shopping centers and beach for a while longer before saying goodbye. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the island for the first time.","Summerville, South Carolina",1,4.0

It was my 5th or 6th stay there and it was excellent as always. Perhaps due to my Marriott Bonvoy silver elite status, even though silver is not a high tier, I was upgraded to a ""Premier Oceanview King"" room in the Ainahau Tower, which had been renovated and had a great lanai with an absolutely stunning view of the ocean. You could sit on the lanai and watch surfers, catamarans and outrigger canoes all day. I find the service at the Princess Kailuani is always exemplary. From the General Manager to the front desk to the room attendants and breakfast buffet staff, they are all hospitality professionals, many of who have worked there for decades, and they provide a friendly and welcoming environment and courteous service. The hotel has a lot of history and has a nice Hawaiian vibe. I know some reviews are not great because of the age of the hotel, and I think the hotel acknowledges that it can be a challenge to keep everything up to standards when they are anticipating closing the hotel in a couple of years for a full makeover.... but they certainly try. Other notes: -The gym is decent and well used and has a nice outlook over the pool.-You get 15% off food bills with Bonvoy membership (any level)Overall, Hawaii hotels are expensive and I find this one to be great value. It's right in the heart of Waikiki and although it's not on the beach, on average you save at least $100US per night compared to even the least expensive beachfront hotel. And the pool desk will lend you beach chairs as well as towels for when you head across to the beach, and they bring bottled water to a designated spot on the beach three times a day. I would recommend the place for sure.",,1,5.0
