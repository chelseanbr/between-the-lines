We're in the middle of a pandemic, and they charged us almost $500 to cancel a reservation which the government is currently forbidding us from keeping. We tried contacting them for 4 weeks with zero response and finally just had to pay to cancel the reservation through Booking.com or pay the full $1300 for the stay. Booking.com contacted them on our behalf and their response was basically ""too bad, pay to cancel"". Deplorable.","New York City, New York",10,1.0

You get all of the basics you would expect for your great time in Hawaii. Itâ€™s in a great area close to everything. There are several restaurants in the building and a 7/11 and ABC store next door. Check in was super easy and all staff was very nice!!,,0,5.0

One elevator of 3 out of service the entire time.Air Conditioning unit in the room was very noisy and the remote control unit did not work. It was necessary to turn off the unit at night because it would continuously turn on and off all night long making it impossible to sleep.Windows were not air tight so you could hear the wind whistling outside. Nice view of the Canal and mountains.Bed was comfortable. Dresser and bed table outdated and well used with lots of scratches and holes visible. No cupboard space or hangers to hang clothes available.Bathroom had been renovated and was actually quite nice. Shower only.Coffee Unit sketchy... heating unit completely burnt.,,0,2.0
