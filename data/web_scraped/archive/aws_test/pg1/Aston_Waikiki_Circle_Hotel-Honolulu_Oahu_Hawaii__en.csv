The panoramic view of the Kuhio and Waikiki beaches combined is a picture so perfect! This is the main reason why we kept on coming back to this hotel. It's like a home away from home. Thanks to all the staffs, you all made our vacation complete. Keep up the good work God bless you all. Aloha!",Perranporth,4,4.0

I usually stay at the larger resorts when in HNL, but since this was a short 3 night trip we decided to stay here to save some money. I probably wouldn’t stay here again because it lacked amenities, but overall it was a nice stay for the price. What I liked: - Great location (right across the street from the Duke’s statue).- Staff was very friendly and accommodating when we asked for a late checkout. - Beds were comfortable- Balcony with ocean front view was amazing!- Concierge service (although they didn’t help very much)What I didn’t like:- Bathroom and shower were REALLY small! - lots of outside noise - garbage trucks, leaf blowers in the morning (sliding glass door is old and not double paned). We were in the 5th floor- No real lobby area","San Francisco, California",61,3.0

Very basic but very clean rooms. The staff are excellent and pleasant...ALL OF THEM, special mention to Shawn at reception who is very helpful and great to deal with. We stayed at 1205 which had a fantastic view of Waikiki. We arrived early (8am) and Shawn did his very best to get us a room so we can rest - we were in our room by 9am!The bed was clean and comfy, and though room was outdated, it was very clean and had everything you need. Bathroom was small, but expected given the size of the bldg.The also offer a free shuttle and their driver, Earl, was wonderful!Would definitely stay here again!","Sydney, NSW",9,5.0
