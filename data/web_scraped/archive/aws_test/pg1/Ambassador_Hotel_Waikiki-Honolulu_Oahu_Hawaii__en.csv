Hotel isn’t very modern but it still offered great amenities. Front desk was really helpful in answering our questions and even booked us a last minute ride to the airport. Hotel staff were very polite and when we needed more towels, the staff were quick to provide for us. Definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for a great location in Waikiki.
