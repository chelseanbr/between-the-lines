But this is a “budget” hotel. No bells and whistles... pool is not really much of anything... decor is dated (think 1980s Holiday Inn). The staff is friendly but the cleaning staff unfortunately tended to be smokers so after my room was cleaned I would come in to that smell and would have to open the patio doors to air it out so I just started putting the do not disturb on the door so they wouldn’t clean.,"Medicine Hat, Canada",0,3.0

Bed was comfortable shower pressure was good, room was a good size. Hotel and rooms a bit dated but it seems most hotels here are...Fantastic location central to everything can walk everywhere.

Definitely not worth $250+ a night, however- as there are hotels just as nice for about 1/2 this rate all around Honolulu. Tried to sign up for their frequent guest program, was unable to do so due to glitch in system. After a trip to the front desk, calling Outrigger Central in Colorado- they had to call me back to give me my special Discovery membership number. When I inquired if my number was plugged into my current stay's folio, the clerk says ""I'm sorry, but we don't participate in that program."" What the hell ?? Why did I sign up for your frequent guest program ?? What's my incentive to stay here again ?? What a waste of time. Offering a frequent guest program that only certain Outrigger Hotels utilize, good luck trying to decipher which ones do. Forget this place, will never return- after going through this nonsense today.","Las Vegas, Nevada",1,1.0
