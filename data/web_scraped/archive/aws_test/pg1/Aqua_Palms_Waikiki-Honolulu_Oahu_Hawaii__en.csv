I just want to give them high praise for relaxing that policy to allow a cancellation with no penalty and no hassle. Considering the financial hit they are about to take, they could have adhered to their policy or simply provided a future travel credit. When I am able to visit, I will definitely book with them again. If they are this accommodating towards someone canceling, imagine how they must treat their guests.","New York City, New York",21,5.0

Probably my only complaint, is amount of time wasted waiting for them every day. There are 3 elevators and would think they would be quicker. The staff was very helpful and friendly.",,0,4.0
