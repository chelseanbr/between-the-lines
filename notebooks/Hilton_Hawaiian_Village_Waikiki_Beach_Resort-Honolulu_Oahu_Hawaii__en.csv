"I enjoyed my stay overall.The room itself was very nice. On a high floor; spacious 1-bedroom unit with a great balcony view of the water.The resort is huge, so I did get lost trying to find my room, but the staff are very helpful and happy to point in the right direction.Food from the restaurants is good, albeit overpriced (not a surprise, though, really).Check-in was fine, though I was a little nonplussed to have the lady tell me my points redemption for the room I got was ""super high"". Oh swell, lol!I picked up a turkey wrap from the on-site store, and when I opened it in my room soon after (like not even 10 minutes), found it to be mushy and soft. Not at all appetizing or even edible, frankly. That was a disappointment.But, the grounds are amazing! Defo take the time to explore if you can!Express checkout was super handy, as I was out to my next adventure by 6am. I also really appreciated the onsite Starbucks that opened at 5:30.","April 15, 2020"
"Our family stayed here as a last second switch from a NYC trip due to COVID-19, so we didn't do a lot of research. We found the hotel staff exceedingly pleasant and helpful through check-in and the luggage process. We had two spacious and well-maintained rooms with ocean balcony views in the Tapa Tower. The beds were comfortable and housekeeping did a great job of accommodating our schedule. We enjoyed the many restaurants around the village (shout out to Blue Water Shrimp for great food/pineapple smoothies and Round Table Pizza) and the shopping in the village was a nice mix of stores. The unsung MVP of the trip was the ABC Store in the hotel, where we found ourselves constantly stopping at. The ice cream shops were great as well. Shaved Ice was a highlight!Due to COVID, we caught the last luau on the island indoors on Thursday night, and it was a lot of fun (would have loved to see it outside under the stars, in a more intimate setting). We thoroughly enjoyed the large, beautiful beach area, and saw plenty of fish/turtles/whales just swimming from shore. The pools were well maintained and my only complaint is the ""towel card"" process is a bit of a hassle. If you are looking for a great hotel with comfortable accommodations, wonderful amenities and fun for the whole family, this is the place. It isn't uber-luxurious, but for 99% of the people in the world, it is a very nice, perfectly situated historical gem, staffed with great employees who care about their guests.","April 13, 2020"
"Great atmosphere in the village. You can pretty much buy all of your souvenirs here too. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower which is right on the oceanfront. Amazing views and a fantastic beach. Lovely calm waters and life on the beach till late hours. Waikiki is definitely the place to be in Hawaii. Rooms are clean, with balcony and modern decor.","April 12, 2020"
